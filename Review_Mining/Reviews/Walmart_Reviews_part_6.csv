rating,review
good,I worked at Walmart during my highschool Years. It is a an okay job to start off with. Although you do run into very rude people and need to learn how to handle the situation
good,It was hard work I mean shipping and receiving and it wasn't really a solid position again I worked for a staffing agency that provided a way to work in Baytown.
good,The benefit are great. Some of the people there are great. We help each other when needed or if our own job is done.  The walmart one app is great because you call always look at you schedule
good,"I loved working for walmart and feel that I was let go unfairly,I was given points when on a medical leave that they were very aware of I became ill with septic Pneumonia and collapsed at work they knew I was hospitalized and still gave me points I wasnt aware of the points and and had transferred to a new store they were promoting me to a supervisor position the same day with in 5 min they fired me,I was devastated.and had no other income annd had to go and live with a family member."
good,Stopping shoplifters fun job. Inventory control was tough cause management was hard to work with. The hours was long and you may work any shift at any given time.
good,"I had many challenges within Wal-Mart. I was an overnight manager throughout my district. I had long nights which would sometimes spill onto the days. It was tough as I could not transfer to days as there were no openings."
good,You've shopped there before. Everyone knows what a Walmart is like. In my experience very few employees cared about doing their jobs well. Shoplifting was common among the customers.
good,"The work is easy, but the pay stays with minimum wage. management and the other workers are the real reason you will stay since everyone is usually pretty cool. Sadley there really isnt any room to move up and walmart is all about saving money, both for the customers and themselves by making sure employees dont get anything in terms of an actually living wage...."
good,"Would not recommend anyone to work at the Vidalia, Georgia location. The management is poor. The work life is very stressful. Little to no opportunity to move up to a full time position. Can earn paid time off, for every 43.33 hours you work you earn 1 hour of paid time off. No vacation or benefits for part time workers."
good,"I have worked many areas of Walmart and I have to say that the TLE is the best place to work. Specifically the one in Seneca Falls, NY. The workers are understanding and management even more so."
good,The job in and of itself isn't hard I actually liked it a lot. The problem is almost all walmarts are understaffed so you have to do three other peoples jobs while you try to do your own. The managers get mad at you for their own mistakes and generally are very rude and unhelpful. there's no training when you start just computer work and then you're on the floor. No respect or care for any of the associates.
good,"Loved the job (work, shift and fellow employees)"
good,Days were fast paced with constant activity handling my own responsibilities and some of salaried managers.  Customer satisfaction was always top priority.
good,"It's very unorganized, unprofessional, and no communication everyone try to overide each other instead of working together that job needs to get better."
good,This job gave me the skills and knowledge to use in other opportunities I have come across. I just think that the store was chaotic at best. Managers tell you to do something one way and then change how they want it done the next. The work to home ratio is non existent. They made everyone want to leave.
good,"You might learn what you need to on the unofficial knowledge of work, you probably won't learn anything career building. Communication is poor, even within departments. Even when heard and understood, management barges on in order to please the higher ups. "
good,"Providing customer service"
good,"WalMart is a well versed company with many options available to associates as well as salaried management. Very fast paced, urget, and upholds to the growing demands of retail."
good,Management is difficult to work with sometimes and often takes help away from areas to cover when extra hiring would have solved most problems. Security is a big issue with little coverage in asset protection at night. Coverage for the front end was also atrocious.
good,"Assist customers with their purchases. "
good,"The hours you are given are never the same. One day you are working early morning, and the next a late night. It was hard to get on a consistent schedule. No one ever knew what was going on and if you asked management or a CSM, you hardly ever got back with. The pay is nice but don't count on getting full time."
good,"In a typical workday, you would clock in and then meet with your supervisors for your daily responsibilities and goals. Once that is done you would survey your daily inventory and plan for the next couple of hours or for items that are coming in."
good,When I started working at Walmart things were nice enough but very quickly things changed. Drama was started and management didn't incentivize  a good work attitude and actually gave rewards to outperform coworkers which caused more drama. Many members of management had no passion to improve how things were and showed favoritism to specific employees
good,The management at the Chicopee Walmart are not the type of people I would recommend anyone to work for because they play favorites with a lot of the associates and the management don’t know how to run a store.
good,"This is not the company to work for if you want to be happy, stressfree and healthy.    High stress work environment. Low pay for the actual work you put in. Slack management. Little to no incentive to be healthy. High cost of insurance. Little recognition for accomplishments.  Other associates are literally the best thing about this job.  I recommend finding something that makes you enjoy work and encourages your happiness."
good,I work in the frozen department and my manager iswonderful in every way. We are always productive and getting things done whether we be in the freezer or on the sales floor.
good,Management is not very supportive or encouraging. Lots of favoritism. Not truly valued for your work only get promoted if your friends with management. New scheduling system is terrible.
good,"I have my personal opinions, but most of the people are easy to get along with and are friendly. it not a really bad place to work but management could use some training to learn how to treat there employees."
good,"Not willing to work with employees, not flexible. Uncaring management, no potential  for growth. No trust in employees. No time off during holiday season. Enjoyed meeting new people, such as customers"
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart for many years, until management started making us work very understaffed and when we got new employees in that didnt want to work they would blame the ones that have been there the longest for to the newer employees mistakes."
good,I like the deli. Its not a bad place just not a job i want for the rest of my life. I would recommend a friend that like a job that's fast-paced and not hard at all .
good,"I was employed at Walmart part-time during high school.  It was a great first job because it gave me the opportunity to learn new skills and become more extroverted; however, I never truly saw it as an opportunity to grow further into the company without any prior post-secondary education."
good,"Busy for the most part"
good,"I was on the mod team, everyone hated you but at the same time everyone praised for making the shelf's look good but you gave them all their deleted items"
good,"Walmart is an alright work place, with poor management that does not communicate very well with each other. the job itself is not hard but with the bad management it makes it like 10 times harder"
good,"like the work...like the insurance...coworkers where great...management was not the greatest, but it is walmart stressful job............................."
good,"Its an enjoyable place to work besides tedious every day tasks which include zoning the shelves, floors, and other areas.You typically have long shifts with two 10-15 minute breaks and one 1 hour lunch break."
good,Everyday was a busy day and I loved that because there was always work to do. I liked that I was able to be cross-trained which allowed me to develop more skills.
good,"One of the highest paying jobs in my area"
good,Management at Walmart is very unprofessional and unresponsive to needs of their customers. Very unorganized in procedures. Only a handful of the management team actually take their jobs seriously and act professional and accordingly.
good,Walmart is a very hard company to work for. Worked for this company for 15 years. Then Due to restructuring I was displaced from my Job without any prior warning.
good,The reason Walmart was stressful is because you have so many managers telling you what to do you never knonwjay needs to be done so end up doing double work rheyntell you your going get something and make false promises and never do there part but want you to give them your all
good,Walmart is a great company that claims to wanna be around for another 50 years that’s impossible with the way they treat there associates.  You shouldn’t have to fear for your job daily or when your sitting at home on the few days you get off.
good,They need to remember the associates that helped build the company and look to retain them not displace them. All companies need new blood but they also to need to retain the older associates that are already trained and can help to train the new associates. When they do a structure change they are displacing the older associates for the newer associates.
good,"El trato hacia los trabajadores no era el optimo, con falta de seguridad."
good,Salaire inadéquat / Manque de personnel / Heures de travail différentes à toutes les semaines /
good,"Working here was a learning process.  I had never done this type work before and I thoroughly enjoyed learning.  Some nights were hard, but on the whole, satisfactory."
good,"Friendly people, brisk pace and workload evenly distributed throughout team.  Each team member responsible to accomplish daily goals set by team leader each morning.  Clear, concise instructions accompanied the intended outcome and expectation for each assigned task."
good,"If you want to move up quickly you can, benefits are good. If you just want part time hours there are probably better places to work, though they are fairly flexible with schedules."
good,".Directivos falta de atención a sus empleados "
good,"Walmarts in the area where I'm from are known for extremely bad customer service because they hire rude employees who think they should be paid for doing absolutely nothing (but in our area that's basically all there is). Therefore, the customers come in with the attitude that they are going to get bad customer service so they automatically have hateful attitudes. No matter how hard I tried to give good customer service it was never enough."
good,Walmart used to be all about their associates but now they are strictly business driven and will cut anywhere they need to including their employees. They are pushing out the old and bringing in new younger generation to help with technology curve.
good,"The title kind of says it all. I wouldn't really make statements about the company as a whole, because there are regional and franchise divisions, and environment depends heavily on the management at a given store. The pay isn't bad, but at my store I had no real opportunities for advancement, and here my supervisors tended to not care about the conditions i was experiencing on days when I was working alone, in bad weather, taking late breaks, and being expected to somehow clean up the parking lot. Overall, meh. They also have a habit of randomly cutting hours or randomly overloading hours."
good,"I left Walmart because my family was starving! Working my butt off and not even getting by financially.  Also, I kept trying to get into a management position - and was being told I was in line - but always got passed over."
good,"In Walmart, I've learned by working as a team, it makes the job much easier for everyone who works in that department. By following the instruction from the supervisor has given me the opportunity to finish the job quicker than it is expected to be."
good,The culture has drastically changed and it is more like the corporate version of the Hunger Games. Loyalty is gone and it's clear that everyone is dispensable and a number on the wage line.
good,The company is a great for those starting off their work experience such as young adults looking for a first job or adults just looking to supplement income.
good,I didn't necessarily enjoy the work environment mainly because of the management. The general manager was very specific and always got on people for tiny things. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone because the environment is stressful and unhappy.
good,"The typical day fluctuated between busy, almost feeling rushed to a slow pace with much standing around and organizing the isles of the cash register you are assigned to at that time."
good,Not much to say about Walmart thats really good but it was ok. I was noticed as being a very good claener and never late or missed work without proper cause.
good,"The people at Walmart suck.  Cashiers get zero respect, and are paid very poorly considering all of the work that they put in.  The manager's are incompetent and do not care about their employees as individuals with needs."
good,I pick cases on the walking rider and the stand-up forklift 150 cases per hour.. i also loaded and unloaded trailers from time to time when the dockes where behind
good,"Completely different atmosphere than what I was used to going from an office job (no weekends, paid holidays, etc) to retail so it was not a good fit for me."
good,I enjoy meeting and talking to customers. that is the best part of my work. the worse part is the attitude that some customers have. some people are very negative. I always give them a smile and tell them to have a wonderful day. I have learned to deal with all types of personalities. Most of the time if you give a kind word the negativity is on that person. I am learning Spanish so I can communicate with them.
good,Decent company. Doesn’t pay enough to live. Management is very biased. Hours are inconsistent. Benefits are poor for part time employees. The expectation for perfection is too much.
good,"The best part when working for Walmart, is that after 90 days of working for this company, employees get 10% of discount in any purchase."
good,"I worked here for about 4/5 moths and the time there, the management team worked with me very poorly, I was getting sexually harassed by another employee and it took over a month for something to be done about it. I did get to meet some great people working here and learned more skills when it came to customer service and presenting myself in a work place but other than that Walmart was not such a great experience for me."
good,I was responsible for keeping a very fast pace line for our customers. Asking the customer if they found everything ok and if they was any input they would lie to add.
good,"Working as a jewelry sales associate has helped multitask and learn time management. My job is to allow customers to look at the different kinds of jewlery we sell and try our best to help find what it is they are looking for. Apart from that I am suppose to maintain the shoe area picked up and zoned as well as the accessories, like backpacks and wallets."
good,"Day started at doing your runs at pulls and out of dates.  Wait on customers and fill order, cook for hot boxes and load ovens.  Clean, and organize and stock. Count tills in Book Keeping, variances, sundries, and trouble shooting. Culture is fast paced and timely. Hardest was having the hours to support our family, and the politic."
good,"I miss working overnights I had very compassionate co workers, I love the store manager and id love to go back to overnight stocking or in to management"
good,"A typical day at Walmart was understaffed and grumpy co-works. The hardest part of working here was that I had to do most of the opening, middle, and night shift duties because no one else wanted too. The most enjoyable part of working here was some of the friendly customers. My manager was extremely nice but others were extremely rude."
good,"it was very stressful working at Walmart bc of management, and bc of the other employees. i did not like working there bc there was a lot of drama happening in my department and plus the management played favorites all of the time."
good,"Its a good place to work. Liked the managers, however do not agree with the point system. 4 points and your fired. They dont take doctor excuses at all. I was in the hospital on leave for kidney stones and pregnant and was let go."
good,Walmart was a great place to start my pharmacy career. The Pharmacist i worked under was very good at teaching the new techs.It is a fast pace environment. The pay was a little below the avg tech salary
good,"every year they take away from their benefits and less pay,not the same company I started with many years ago,raising production rate ,lowering benefits"
good,"I worked overnight so it wasnt all that hectic. It was quite chill, and relaxed. My only problem was with how unprofessional management could be. I enjoyed working with most of my coworkers."
good,Working for Walmart Is OK for A small Town Type of feeling lots of hours away from home once you get passed level 6 job code. The Benefits Are pretty good
good,"It’s a job I guess. I mean if you need a job then do it, I just wouldn’t go out of your way to work for them. They will make you part time and give no way to get full time hours."
good,"Overall, the experience at Walmart was ok. It was good for a summer job, but it wasn't the best for me because it wasn't good experience for my area of study."
good,i was par time worker at this place because my wife she had delivery our child i have to work on time two place full time and part time i had good manager and good time hours to work.
good,"Decent pay, decent benefits. Managers expect way too much and don't help with much of anything, all they do is give direction and follow up, even if we were short handed."
good,"A typical day of an assistant manager consists of a management meeting with all first and third shift managers.  then you go out and tour your departments to see what opportunities are available and what projects still need to be complete.  then you meet again in the beginning of the afternoon to plan for that nights truck deliveries.  then you go back out to the floor to follow up with your department managers to see where they got with the notes that were given previously.  Then you meet back up at the end of the shift to go over what was completed from the morning notes and what will still need to be completed.  In between this administering customer service, accounting needs, deliveries and more."
good,management was one of the biggest problems I had with this job... some of the manager were great then others did very little and expected to much.....
good,I learned that they give chances like coming in 10min late which is still not a good thing to come late but. I do respect and appreciate that they do things like that
good,Good company but the management chooses favorites. Doesn't listen to suggestions on how to better morale. Underlings don't always listen to what they are told to do by their respective manager.  A lot of gossiping and talking behind others backs.
good,"Running cash register, greeting customers, stocking cashier area. My management team were nice to work with. The culture was nice and interesting. The hardest part of the job was standing on concrete floors. The most enjoyable part was getting to know my customers and helping them."
good,"Co-workers are nice and fun to chat with, customers hate you with a furious passion for merely existing, management is 50/50, pay is ok but not great, hours could be a lot better, management does everything in it's power to keep you from getting overtime."
good,The managers should be qualified not only experience to approach the team members in a good manner. For last one year in Fishkill Walmart no proper rest rooms.
good,"Wal-Mart is a vast company with a constant flow of management and other associates. As an employee of Wal-Mart, it is best to remain focused on your job and your customers, being sure that the job is done correctly and efficiently and that the customers are happy and satisfied to the fullest."
good,I think i went into accounting when the office was under construction. Some things where off balance. I had to basically self teach myself a lot which was very stressful.
good,working at walmart was a great place to work as far as the job itself and the people I worked with...I learned alot about the position I was in and how to work up to a promotion in that area...Management was the only complaint I had with the place..They were very unaware of how to run a store and very rude to their employees.
good,"Most of the co- workers were pleasant."
good,What I learned I learned from Walmart is there are no team effort its more of everybody for there self. Management are very poor no communication. Work place are very clean and safe. Its no hardest part of the job its called work smart not hard save injuries. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming to work meeting customers that are nice.
good,"Wal-Mart was a fun, productive, good values where people enjoyed coming to work. We had sick time, holiday pay, personal time, 5 minute window to clock in, and the little things they did to show their appreciation. Now all of that is gone. We barley get our hours and they change the rules every week. A lot of associates left and are still leaving. A 47% turn over for a billion dollar company is bad. We did our job but management is failing us."
good,"The job hours are inconsistent, ranging from 9 hours in a day to less than 5 hours. The managers are for the most part un approchable and don't know how to talk with people. Breaks are not clearly explained in the orientation process. Support managers and even other associates are cut-throat and will throw you under the bus as soon as look at you. They pull you from your duties for 2-3 hours and still expect you to get everything that you have to get finished, finished."
good,"The company doesn't care for the employees anymore. It's getting worse every year. They don't want to pay the past employees ,but they are trying to encourage new employees, but Wal-"
good,"the work is stressful, they go associated and they do not hire anybody, hoping that the one that remains works for two or three.Until a few months ago you could work being self-sufficient but now everything is by order of bosses that every time you arrive one gives a different order and that way you can not work."
good,The hardest part of the job was finding a manager. The most enjoyable part was that talking to the customers. I learned how to work with different kinds of people and the ins and outs of working the front.
good,"i like working here when i first started but after just 1 month they seem to get uneasy and i didnt like the manager they had working there with no experience and the fact that she was unprofessional when she spoke with me. in front of customers she would yell at me in front of them and i feel a different approach of of serviced. being as i was a manager before she took the wrong approach, when handling issues."
good,Enjoy my position. I've learned a lot. The hardest part is the hours schedule are posted sometime. Management is not on one accord with the schedule and do not communicate with each other concerning the schedule
good,Plenty to do. You can work in other areas of the store. Hardest part of the job is  accepting there is no real moving up unless you keep switching stores as that seems to be how you are promoted.
good,Aprendí a tratar y darle servicio a todo tipo de clientes
good,"For me working at Walmart was a great first adult job. This job was not expected to be a forever job, got treated as a minimum paid worker but good for working through school to get to a permanent job later."
good,"	Responsible for talking to the customers, responding to questions and giving assistance while processing transactions. 	Required to uphold the tone of the register area by removing un-purchased merchandise and restocking it in the appropriate areas"
good,"Great team work, motivated coworkers, everyone was nice, very helpful people . I would definitely recommend friends and family to work for this job company because of the positive environment ."
good,"Overnight stocking was a fairly easy job, but some of their expectations were unrealistic and unobtainable. The employee would be treated harshly why the shift supervisors for by with murder."
good,"working for walmart was actually fun, easy and enjoyable. not enough to cover life expenses. management is not good. Everyone on the lower totem pole kept getting hours shaved off from their paychecks."
good,"clock in, do a list of tasks, and clock out"
good,"being my 2nd job i think it was not too bad, met great people and friends working there and some of the managers were pretty relaxed while some weren't but i wouldn't work there again."
good,It's a ok place to work just make sure you are available for everything such schedule and for time off when needed but it's not always easy to get time off with so many people
good,"If they can throw it on you, they will. and if you can do another position you will be expected to do it plus your current work with no extra compensation. If you don't have good cohesion with other workers in your department, its going to be a rough work experience."
good,Great place but wrong people in higher roles. Lots of progression in the right direction but old ideals stop the progress and processes. Very sad state!
good,"Walmart, well the one That I worked at was an above mediocre experience for the first 3 months of me working there then work got a little heavy when Christmas came especially since 9 out of 10 times I was working alone. After they raise your pay for part-timers your hours will get cut no matter what."
good,The hardest part of the job is maintaining a work life balance.  It is constant extra days on very short notice.  I have given my all to Wal-Mart for almost 23 years.  It is time for me to give back to myself and my family.
good,An associate will have 4 managers.  I always asked them to priortize the work assignments given me in order to meet their goals.  Helping the customer was the best.  Knowing that you solved a problem for someone is always rewarding.  The firing of assistant managers and co-managers makes it hard to know where you stand.  Management needs more skills in instrucking and talking to an associate.
good,"Walmart is a fast pace  compamy  more than a typical day of work , but if you are willing to learn to advance your career to prepare you for other opportunities in retail management  as a young person  it is great to work there"
good,"Uma empresa que gostei muito "
good,"Walmart was a very decent employer. I was in the Deli, so a lot of the issues you hear about don't really affect people who work behind the counters, mostly away from customers. It's a very decent work experience, nothing more."
good,"Every day is different, There are good days and bad days. Sometimes the customers and employees may have a bad day so attitudes may fly. It is really based on the mood of the store."
good,Já foi uma empresa muito boa hoje em dia esqueceram os princípios básicos.
good,Walmart did not work with scheduling nor was there supervised departments. Coworkers called out regularly and often left their shifts when they wanted to before the work was complete.
good,I enjoyed being a pharmacy technician at this location for the most part. There was a lot of stress involved with dealing with customers as well as some of the other employees. A lot of drama was going on at this store when I worked there and that was part of the reason I left. Not enough compensation either.
good,Es una empresa de valores aunque el ambiente laboral es un poco hostil
good,When i started working at this walmart most assococaites were lazy and unfriendly so i instantly got discouraged  but overall its an ok job i think other locations are better then the one on liberty road
good,"Walmart is a good place to work. It was better about 20 years ago. They cared more about the employees. They were more family orientated."
good,Low level managers are egotistical maniacs.  New managers never thought they would ever be managers and just make up things to say to impress themselves.
good,"Won the Happy to Help Award twice in the same month for providing excellent customer service"
good,"Go to the source—employees who have been there, done that. In the age of consumer-review sites, it's no surprise to discover that over half of potential hires said they would trust a company's current employees for an accurate and honest review of the company itself. -monster"
good,"Uma empresa que  tinha tudo para dar certo, mas a parte de gestores deixa a desejar."
good,"The Walmarts I worked at were ok. It was sufficient to have as a job while in graduate school. We did have one customer service manager who took her job too seriously and jumped on cashiers unfairly. It was like she was looking for reasons to fuss at someone. I didn't have my cellphone out, showed up on time, was efficient, courteous and friendly to customers. She reprimanded me twice and then discovered she was in error for giving me a hard time. She did this to other employees under her and treated us like we were guilty until proven otherwise. I did not like this, but otherwise it was an ok company to be an employee."
good,Here i moved around alot to different departments. I unloaded and loaded trucks from the cold and hot side. I worked with a team of coworkers. We did everything at a fast past. It was a great workout and very competitive.
good,"didn't feel like the company really invests in its employees. the pay was low for newer department manager, there were people who do was less than department managers but get paid about the same."
good,"A typical day at Wal-mart was not particularly exciting or much to write home about, a few sales here and there, maybe one or two problems outside of the protocol that required some critical thought, a bit of cleaning and you're on your way. The little things that pile up though are what really drove me to transfer my department and see the bigger picture outside of my little cash register. The issues being the store has an obsession with constantly changing something. No matter how nonsense, no matter how many layers you have to dig through to find the purpose to it all, not matter how it affect the bottom line or customer satisfaction things will change for better or often for a little Wal-mart in an older community like mine, for the worse.The desire to modernize in an older community has driven a lot of our customer base away and the constant changes to department protocol and what we can and can't do, or simply things you aren't told you can and can't do, made working on the front end a hassle and now that the store has done its due diligence in driving away as many cashiers as it possibly could it struggles to keep their lines down and their customers happy. And for what? A new department customers are going to be reticent to use because they value the interaction with a cashier and driving away valuable employees through consolidating departments and constant iteration on a formula that worked. I learned a lot in my time working at Wal-mart, enough to know just how badly corporate ideas that have to be implemented at every store for better and worse, can really turn what"
good,"Walmart isn’t a bad place to work at. It really isn’t, it’s just the stress that the job brings can be pretty tiring and as someone who struggles with anxiety, it doesn’t really help me mentally. I’ve worked in two different positions at walmart; an really early shift and a mid day to evening type shifts. But overall, depending on how the management in that store is, working at Walmart is a good."
good,"Stressful, fast-paced environment. They offer good health insurance with salary-continuance for upper management. Pay is very good in management, but work/life balance is lacking."
good,"You are allotted 2 attempts to test out. You must have an accuracy score of at least 95%. If you are not successful, then you will be required to take Medical Keyboarding or wait to test out for the following semester.  You will be notified by the department via email regarding your results within 48 hours of taking the test. Your results will be good for one (1) calendar year. Please make sure that your computer is running the most current version of JAVA. You may also find it helpful to clean out your cookies under Internet Options."
good,I liked my job at walmart until the cut my hours only to save them on paying me benefits.  Went from working 40 hours a week down to 16.  They give pay raises and then cut hours.  Do not care about the welfare of there employees
good,Walamart was ok. I didn't like how it was managed and the constant altering work days. There is no getting used to the schedule. The managers seemed to not care about the employees.
good,A typical day a work was stocking products on the shelves making sure they are ready for the customers.  I learned how to operate all the equipment needed to run the warehouse.  The hardest part of the job was getting everything done in allotted time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all the other employees.
good,"The managers their is what caused me to leave, she had her picks that she would let walk around and do nothing then the rest of us got stuck doing everything, they also would give you pints even if you had hospital documents, the manger their would walk around throw orders and if you asked a simple question she would get angry like the world was about too end.. im a very hard worker and very dedicated too any thing but if the managers are not dedicated to there workers what is the point of giving my all and having no back up, TEAM WORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK!!!"
good,"Your typical Walmart work environment. You do get paid a little more for being a personal shopper, but not as much as you should. They also don’t allow your customers to tip you for your good service"
good,I have worked at Wal-Mart for almost 2 years and been working 7am-4pm for over a year and was told if I did not open my availability I could no longer have the same shift or be full time.
good,"job was okay was a great starter job but had its flaws when it came to management engaging with regular associates "
good,"Management at Walmart is pressured to evaluate on cut throat curve and it if you are not on the right side of their thinking, you will be in the cross hairs and let go."
good,Okay place to work. Some good managers some bad. Do have to work different shifts hours are not consistent different days off decent pay will work around your availability fast paced some heavy lifting depending on what department you work in but they don't care if your hurt or sick it will count towards your attendance they do not accept doctor's excuses sometimes it felt like all they cared about was making money not the value of their associates
good,Walmart is a great job to have besides the people you work with keeping up confusion it was okay but I didn't like that the supervisior didn't want you to ask her questions or help you out with the job.
good,"Have to be willing to do anything and sacrifice staying later than scheduled, working days off during inventory and holidays, and change and implement new direction from Market Managers."
good,"Basically, you come in and you get thrown into the heat of things, no matter the time of the day, because it was always something different in the Deli at any given moment."
good,"Walmart isn't the greatest place to work at, but it isn't the worst either.  My schedule was a bit all of over the place and the position wasn't challenging enough.  Pay was abysmal, and often times I didn't nearly enough hours to compensate for that."
good,"A typical night at walmart was met with receiving our tasks for the night then being told how slow and horrible we were at them. Without having the necessary crew members to take care of the whole store some areas would be left undone, then we would be punished for our understaffed crew commonly being threatened to lose more staff."
good,"management has no idea what there doing if your lucky youll get one that has a faint idea about whats going on, but the people you work with are pretty good"
good,I really enjoy working here the customers was great to be around to help them. The job is a fast paced so we can get things done.We have to try and keep the check out lines from being to long.
good,Could've been a more enjoyable job as a college student if more hour flexibility was available. I learned how to operate registers and deal with a high volume of customers.
good,"Its a Great part time job, if its something that you don't rely on to live.  Walmart never cares about the little people, and management will never protect you if it makes them look bad, at least at the store that I worked at.  Management will terminate you for the smallest thing without thinking for themselves because a system tells them to fire someone, even when their own HR department advises them not to.  Overall,  it really depends on who you have to work with, but its fine for part time work."
good,I would recommend this company to someone to work at. They do offer a good chance to move up in the chain of command. Management could be a little better.
good,when doing things through walmart just make sure rescources are used properly and all steps re done correctly. I had alot of good experiences with walmart and my family enjoyed the family functions walmart had for associates.
good,Basiclly just show up and work. Dont over do your breaks and life is pretty easy. The pay is better than working fast food and the work is a lot easier. Where I worked you get two 15 min breaks and an hour lunch. Its pretty chill.
good,"At Walmart you really only work with minors, which means they think they know more than you even if they haven't been there as long. They also don't care how there employees are treated by others."
good,"A typical day in this position includes unloading trucks, pulling pallet jacks and carts, organizing the backroom, stocking, and customer service. The shifts are 2pm to 11pm. Workers learn problem solving and communication skills."
good,It was my first job back in 2001. It was an okay company to work for but I would not work there again. I was a teenager in highschool and it was close to home and school.
good,"This is Walmart. The shifts are not flexible. The environment is usually hectic and stressful. Management seems to work against the employees. I was pregnant and they refused to let me use the restroom when I needed to, even though it was technically a medical reason."
good,I’ve aquired a lot of training and problem solving skills within the years I’ve worked for this company. There’s just not much room for growth not good benefits.
good,Working here made the time pass quicker because there were a lot of people to work with. There was always a way to get along with other and help where it was needed.
good,"Working with the customer first hand is a rewarding experience because you can meet all types of people. Processing checks, paying bills, answering the telephones, and getting people the help they need for whatever the issue. My managers tried for the most part to be there when needed, but it didn't always happen so I had to be resourceful on helping the customer out."
good,"ok place to work if you dont have a family, if you do you will never see them if you are a manager. the people that work there are good and fun to be around."
good,"While you may not know of the back end of things at walmart, the ideas you may have picked up already are true. Bad management is rampant, and company standards change constantly."
good,I had some good days at work some managers just have nasty attitudes I learned that  regardless of a situation stay calm  when it comes to customers even though they not always right up to managers
good,"Learned that I should never render Services for less than I am worth unless it would reap long term benefits with a company. the culture was full of individuals, everyone kept to themselves or their group"
good,"Had a lot of fun working, but eventually stopped working due to school.I would recommend to all my family and freinds to apply at walmart. It really is a great company."
good,"*no set scheule "
good,Offer you benefits after 3 months 401k they invest it with the stocks so you also own stock. Management was to many and lack of communication wouldnt help between the different hour ones
good,"Not as easy as some would think. The work is constant, yet never enough people to work it. It's a great job if you are looking for a little extra cash yet , don't expect to gain riches. Not enough experienced people to teach the new hires"
good,"Since it was my first job I wasn't sure what to expect but i guess it was cool. On a typical day it was very busy in the morning and afternoons a lot of moving and a lot of talking which was new to a shy, introverted person like me."
good,"I was hired on as a minor, and I eventually turned 18. That is significant, because as a minor, I worked in the back room, but did not have back room staff as my managers. This led me to getting an assistant manager making my schedules and helping me, whereas normally that role would be filled by a support manager and the department managers above him/her."
good,"As an apparel/ jewlery associate, we were always understaffed and it would be maybe 3 or 4 apparel associates that were closing and it was often very stressful. As you know, walmart gets packed and lines are terrible. The always pulled us from our areas and directed us to the registers which made for us not to get our areas done."
good,It’s A Okay Place To Work If You Like Seeing People And Interacting With other. But On The Management End I Think It Could Be Better That What It Is Right Now
good,"I have worked at Walmart for a long time and it has steadily declined over the years. I do not believe they will be able to compete with Amazon in the online advancements. I strongly believe Walmart to be a company in its final days (in 10 years it will likely be going under). If you have to have a job, then Walmart does provide that opportunity. However, the hours are horrible and management is pathetic."
good,All production numbers have gone up. Displaced many fixed position employees in the last 4 months. Most production jobs are strenuous on the body. Little to no room for advancement.
good,Walmart is a typical retail pharmacy job. If you have any experience in that area you know how bad it is. It's fine for starting out and getting a year or two of experience on your resume but get out as soon as you can. Unless you're lucky and got a good pharmacy manager.
good,"It was a good job. It taught me how to work in a quicker working environment. They were not s good with scheduling, they would put me to work during school hours."
good,"Sometimes the management would be rude,then there would be good managers. We would have 3 assistant managers overnight some of them really cared and it showed with their actions,then we had lazy disrespectful ones too who barely did anything just gave out orders."
good,communication is terrible between upper managers and they pull you left and right. It can be a decent place to work but too many managers for one store.
good,When trying to balance school and work it was very hard Walmart didn't work with me and had trouble adhering to the schedule i could work. I also work over 50% out of my job code majority of the time.
good,"Started as floor associate in Hardware. Was asked by store manager to become manager in training . I accepted. Never got any of my training other then to do the department manager job. I was also trained to mix paint , pull stock , bin stock in right place , also count the negative on hands and correct them if need be."
good,"Fairly unimpressed with the overall experience with the company. Training is decent at best with little incentive to improve. The new WOW program reduced full-time positions and increased work load to all lower levels of management. Benefits are garbage. Your wage is essentially minimum for the rest of your life, unless you have someone in the company fighting for your merit increases yearly. The veterans who have been there for years are your only source of educating yourself within the company. Do not get stuck with the company, use it as a resume builder. Perfect first job."
good,it was fine working there ..just wish they would explain how thing work when you get sick..the pay was good .I enjoyed working with my coworker.i like work with my customers
good,Worked there for a number of years. Fast passed and stressful at times but mainly fair place to work. Pay was decent but worked on 3rd shift made it difficult to have a social life
good,"Great place to make friends..  Lack of training for associates.  "
good,"Spends more time hurting itself and alienating customer and associates by runnning on below minimum. This causes a dirty messie store, exhausted associates and unhappy customers leading to loss of revenue."
good,"This is my first experience in the retail environment.  My experience has been in an office environment. Since my entire background has been in an office environment, this is where my skills are most proficient and better utilized."
good,I was moved once my location closed down and this location was so out of order. They promised 40 hours every they cut the hours after a month working there . They overworked their employees and hated giving breaks .
good,"Working for Walmart is simply basic. If you are like most people and must have a job to survive, this will kind of fit the bill. The pay is minimal, but you make more than you would at Dillon's. The hours are not great, but they are steady. You can count on having hours each week and getting paid every other week. But, they will not allow full time hours or overtime for the majority of their employees Other employees are friendly and easy to get along with, for the most part. I really enjoyed my job when I first began to work at Walmart. I started off in the bakery at a Walmart Neighborhood Market. But, the location I worked at was closed and I was transferred to another location. The new location was not ideal, the management was subpar and I ended up dreading going to work every day. I was no longer working early morning hours in the bakery. Basically, I was moved to a 2nd shift stocker position. I was just supposed to ""suck it up and be happy that I still had a job."""
good,"It's a fair place to work, and never turn down overtime if they offer it, because it is usually around the holidays. If you work part-time there are no benefits, so if you are offered full time work then I would take it, because that's when you get benefits"
good,For doing what i did at Walmart the pay was good. Much better than some of my other jobs. Although Walmart only notices the end result of work rather than work throughout the day. This means that if Morning shift employees slack on the job it falls on the ending shift to pick it all up. the would be no discipline for the morning shift. If you ask for days off and get them you might still end up on the schedule as they have a computer generate schedules as oppose to having a manager do it. This also led to some of my shift being a close then open type of deal.
good,With Wal-Mart everyone was expendable. Job security is nonexistent. You don't know if you will have a job the next day. There was no benefits except stocks which only benefited the company.
good,"Management sucks, Pay sucks, benefits sucks, hrs suck. Not the best place to work but a  job is a job. Worked here for 2 yrs only got a 30 cent's raise most supervisors and managers tried to prevent you from promotions"
good,I’ve worked for Walmart for 7 months and your manger or supvisor isn’t going to hear you out and care what you have to say or feel. My example is working hours I’m getting less working a week that expected my availablity is all day for working hours and only work 1-3 days out of 7 days. And getting less than 20 hrs a weeks. This job isn’t meant for a carrier it’s more of a short term job
good,Depending on which store you go to the management is very poor and doesn’t really care about the way they treat people far as associates.  But the Job itself it’s great to work at if they have good management
good,Always busy stocking and/or organizing merchandise that is stocked on the sales floor to make it more shop-able.  No two days are exactly alike as you never know what type of customer issues may arise. Work with a variety of people both as your co-workers and the customers you serve.  The hardest thing about working for WalMart is inconsistency of schedule and management doesn't communicate effectively with sales associates.
good,Wal~Mart is a fast pace retail environment that doesn't hold to the family values that it was originally built on. They penalize you if you have to miss work do to family emergencies. They are not equal in their pay.
good,I enjoyed the job position and the people I worked with. It was scary with the amount of layoffs over the past couple of years. You never knew if the next person out the door would be you.
good,The only issue I has was that my manager didn't care about her workers as far as medical problems people were fired for being in the hospital or getting sick at work.
good,Management is difficult because of the size of the organization. They have stopped listening to the employees' ideas and suggestions and have a very structured approach to all situations.
good,i was a dairy stocker so id just go in stock milk yogurt an eggs an then help people if they needed anything or organize the cooler if it was messy but other than that i was a pretty easy job
good,I just started working that week And Black Friday Sales made me wanna Quit that day it was hard at first but then I got to get used to it real quick to
good,Well it was my longest job and moved departments only once. The work place was very high paced when I got there. Then when I got promoted the first time it changed a little. The placed was at times working people like crazy. Then when I got promoted again that's when we got a new Store Manager in and everything changed. Things got really stressful to a point one employee had to quite because the doctor stated that it was bad for that persons health.
good,"I didn't have a bad time working at walmart, but I did struggle with the slow pace of my job. I would have been more satisfied working in sales, or stocking. Something with multiple tasks, and to keep me busy."
good,I enjoyed working at walmart. The only thing was that I spent a lot of time working with poor advancement. I didn't get paid that well but it was also one of my first positions of that kind at the time.
good,This job has the potential to be a great job if training and management truly held up to the company policies. But when you receive a write up in your first 3 days and suddenly become a constant target of management you will lose motivation.
good,Depending on what member of management you have during the day your workload is bearable or unbearable as management can hound you and watch over your shoulder when it is time for their superiors to come visit their location.
good,"- Very productive day"
good,"The job duties was greeting customers, checking receipts for high price items such as, electronics, TV'S and etc. There wasn't anything hard about the job very easy and standing for 8 hours."
good,I loved working in the deli and working with customers management was ok..they had their favorites...got really sick and then when came back from my leave of absence they got rid of me before I could start work again...they did this to a lot of people over the years...the down fall!
good,Ámbito laboral agradable. Respeto por el individuo. Buena remuneracion.
good,"As a cashier, it's was a great place to work. The pay is good, the benefits are O.K. The number of hours available fluctuate pretty regularly, up and down. The more open your availability the better chance of getting more hours."
good,"The company is so large that it depends on where you work and with whom.  When I first started with the company, I could not see myself working anywhere else.  As I have had the opportunity to learn and grow in different areas I was able to see several aspects of the company.  A job is typically what you make of it and Walmart is no different."
good,"This job is nice for college students as it has flexible schedule for you so you work when you want to. You can do short shifts or whole 8 hours. "
good,fast days simple tasks very easy to find a steady routine and keep busy wile serving customers at the same time theres days where I go help ladys put grocerys in car
good,"Stocking isn't too demanding of a job, the overnight schedule was not great. The pay was fair, the hours were plentiful, but I never felt like a part of the team."
good,Over all  decent employment although high stressful  environment often between employees  and  or customers. Beginning pay grade low although  improve  is rumored  and potential for career advancement  availability  Overall i liked  my job i general  but a lot of unnecessary employees rivalry and unprofessional management decision making leaves room for better company policies to improve qualify of work place eventually reflections of business as a whole and profits both business and employees
good,"It's been a few years since I worked for Walmart. So far, I haven't seen benefits better than what Walmart had to offer. The insurance was definitely gold."
good,My only real complaint about Walmart is the management team was absolutely clueless about any of the policies. It didn't help the same policy could change two or three times in a week.
good,"I've worked at Walmart for about 7 years and I'm sure, as a whole, Walmart is a good business to work for. They have competitive pay, as well as vacatation pay, decent benefits and insurance. "
good,"nice people to work with.  you will never get a raise early even if you do a fabulous job   wont have the work schedule done ahead of time."
good,"Most workers weren't helpful and managers were very rude. Somewhat dangerous working conditions. Not much hands on training was provided. Benefits took a long time to receive, but the pay was decent."
good,"Job advancement was always hard. Pay was never the best, customers are usually rude, they are strict on hiring people for full time they usually keep them as part time so they don't have to give out so many hours"
good,There are a lot of abrupt changes happening that associates are not prepared to deal with. Changes are coming without warning and people’s entire lives are changing and not for the good.
good,"Loved to worked there just didn't like the pay or lack of room for full time or advancements. The management was ok, I got along with them and like them personally. I loved how laid back and friendly they were."
good,"the worst part of the job is no work and family life balance, as a single mom in management they still wanted me to work 50 hours that it called for putting int anywhere from 60 to 70 hours a week sometimes. They did not appreciate it if I chose my child before the store. The management I worked with at the time was not for the associates and had lots of favoritism."
good,typical day we are short handed compared to the work load required per day. management is mostly no where to be found when needed. hardest part of the job is trying to balance everything to complete while providing excellent customer service.
good,My job was to stock shelves during the Holiday period. I worked with Pallet Jacks and cardboard compressors. I was able to help with customer needs and work with a great crew.
good,"My typical night was the graveyard shift.  I had worked on the average of 32 to 40 hours per week.  I was cashier that worked with varies groups of people.  I was able to work with the opposite gender for a change.  The place was very busy and had a chance to meet different people from all walks of life."
good,It was ok could have been a lot better they put you in a new position in don’t teach you the do’s and don’t and want to coach you for not completing the job you didn’t know how to do because they never showed you the right way
good,"A good working atmosphere, nice co-workers and management. Strictly enforced rules and dismissals. Low pay and not much advancement, no health benefits unless you work and maintain 32 hours per week.  Very difficult, as in out of season period I only ever worked 20 hours."
good,first time  working there it was ok jus management was  very petty they were childish and rude everything was a  joke and no one had respect for each other but my job was easy and i enjoyed dealing the customers
good,I like that they train you for the position on the job and with glms online training to get you ready for everyday life at the pharmacy. management has been very helpful over the past 4 years of employment with flexible hour options and PTO and sick time available. I enjoy going to work most days because of my coworkers and supervisors. The hardest part of the day is dealing with the general public when they are already sick and just trying to get their meds to go home.
good,"Management would always change things around last minute either it be schedules, policies, or how end caps would be set up without informing their employees and get mad at the floor associates because lack of communication with them."
good,"when I arrive my job I check my tools is working good and clean for starte look how to starer verifie the over stack   how is my  counts  and scan, I was resposoble  the all grocery I pull is in a good place, some times I don't  undesrstand, when I asked a managent I learn a lot."
good,I unloaded trucks and management wasn't hands on in helping get it done.The hardest part of the job was there was not enough help.The most enjoyable part of the job was that some of the people I worked with stepped up and we got the work done.
good,"During a typical day, I would greet people, restock shelves with returns, and when necessary, gather carts from the parking lot. Management at my particular Walmart was not very good. Every time I came to them with a problem, they would tell me that I needed to use my own judgment instead of offering advice."
good,"In my experience, Wal-Mart is a great first job but anything beyond that is soul-crushing."
good,I worked overnight for the first time and took some time to get use to. Some of the front end managers were rude and had dissatisfying attitudes towards cashiers as well customers. They do have a flexible schedule where if need be will be understanding for a shift change. They are strict on attendance.
good,"Trabalhar no Walmart Brasil foi muito bom para mim, o tempo que fiquei lá aprendi muito e cresci como pessoa e profissional."
good,"Not enough people to cope with the work. You  have to do what ever with the same pay. Days off are not really fixed. Since you are doing someone else job, you don't get to do your own job, you get blamed for that. You are blamed for not doing your job. Everything else was okay besides these"
good,"Walmart was a mess, short breaks, and sometimes had to even wait past my break time for them to get somebody to cover my break. prices sometimes were messed up and customers used to get angry and managers took their time to get things."
good,Good job for people going to school wouldn't recommend  for people looking for something that they can grow in. Very tedious work to be done everyday.
good,Being a cashier at Walmart is a strenuous job.  It's very busy. In my opinion they have too many clicks and not enough employees doing what they were hired to do.
good,Management is not very productive. A lot of the sales associates and department managers are not productive and do not get into trouble for it. The people who come in and do their jobs are expected to do more than anyone else. There is a lot of unnecessary drama and people just expect you to do their job for them.
good,"I've been with Walmart almost ten years now and started as a skeptic and cynic. My hourly experience was decent for a retail environment - time off and benefits are competitive, training is improving all the time, and there CAN be a friendly and cohesive atmosphere. My experience in management has seen repeated consolidation of departments, changes in workflow and expectations, and generally a downward motion in morale and a happy work environment. When leadership changes at a market, regional, divisional or senior leadership level the results vary greatly. The idea that there is a place in the company for most anyone has gone by the wayside in favor of coach or be coached (written up) and a 'healthy paranoia' of keeping one's job. Pressure from online retailers has driven the company to a less than favorable place in their way of handling things: people in particular. Goals have become outlandish and the resources to meet those goals non existent."
good,Walmart is always crazy! Never anything I mind but I do feel like with a place that is always crazy and understaffed they should be more welcome to someone wanting full time. I will say training is never an issue but I also will say that there are always people  coming and going there is never a real team feel.
good,"Okay, I was just a cashier, management was nice. I was only a temp, so I wasn't there long. I was a fast hard worker, and lazier workers got to stay when I didn't."
good,"Generally bad, only good thing is there's lots of room for advancement."
good,"Walmart is one of the biggest companies that makes money in the retail industry, that being said though, they can improve a lot. Managers are never on same page, you are always doing somebody else's job, and the pay is terrible."
good,"Walmart is a good set of baby steps for getting into retail and customer service. They help you understand business and how to run a retail environment. They also give you a good amount of breaks and will work around your schedule. The staff there is usually very nice and helpful."
good,I’ve worked there for 13 years not a bad company to work for but in my opinion it has become less family friendly that being said they do provide lots of opportunities in learning and growing
good,"If you can handle a busy workplace with multiple people to answer to you will be fine."
good,"While some of the people there were rather hostile some of them made great working partners, the management, however, could never be found, I understand it was the peak season, but most of the time I had to figure situations out by myself."
good,"Good store to work for,  only problem were their managers. Managers were very rude and disrespful. They always wanted the employee to help them but did nothing in return to help their employees.  Very unprofessional. Good company to work for except managers."
good,Come in side Walmart Super Center and greet everyone with a warm big smile and say Good Morning How Are You? Next I clock in and start my shift for the morning and get ready for our morning meeting.
good,Walmart is an ok company to work for if you do not have kids or a family. They are not understanding about illness and unexpected events that may lead to needing a day off.
good,Advancement seems to be on a buddy system or by favoritism and not by actual skill set. For salaried managers the work life balance is difficult as you are technically always on the clock and get called at all hours.
good,"It is a fair company to work for, but it is not all it is cracked up to be. Most people are excited about working for walmart before actually getting hired. Once you are hired and have worked for the company you begin to understand why walmart is just another job."
good,I was in the Gas Station as an attendant.cI liked the job it kept me busy but Scarry at times especially whenI first started. Not much training and was to close by myself alot of times and at night. I was a woman and sometimes be there alone
good,"High expectations of every one, especially since they want to beat Amazon.  Sometimes too caught up on policy and procedure to the point that the leaders are only managing policies and procedures and not free to be leaders."
good,the managers werent as understanding when u had to leave cause ur child has been an accident   i disliked it. i wouldnt work there again no hoilday pay either
good,"Good job, benefits for a high school attendant, which i was at the time. Several departments available for different work preferences. Benefits such as 401K."
good,"Often hard to get away for lunch before 4:00 pm. Long days, typically 10 to 11 hour shifts. Management is very cliquish. Best part of job is helping the patients."
good,"Overall was a good job. I stocked shelves and made the aisles presentable for customers. Management was not all that great problems with employees were not resolved, but they did help you keep busy. The hardest part of the job was getting to higher areas in the freight area. I enjoyed the people that I worked with it was a very uplifting environment."
good,I liked working at Walmart because I knew it would help in my future career. I got great customer service skills and helped me improve in several ways. It also helped learning how to address certain situations the correct way and improve if needed.
good,"Clocking in or out for the day or meal breaks. If there is no coverage, you won' t get your breaks and your lunches are always late ( don't be a diabetic on the job), management don't care enough. I did learn to communicate better with people (customers and co-workers) and set modulars and features. Zoning is required before you leave for the day and putting up returns (which the closer always gets stuck with from all shifts). Also learned to check in freight; put the freight away into proper places. Can be frustrating when you have to take care of multiple departments and having no assistance."
good,"Wal-Mart has a stigma surrounding it, and many people judge it simply based upon this.  I don't think it's as bad as people make it out to be, but everybody has their own opinions.  I had good times and bad times, but I am still friends with many of the people I worked with there."
good,"Most of my years with Wal-Mart were good years. Enjoyable, understood. In recent years my experience has been disappointing, due to changes made in benefits and management that doesn't seem to care. It's harder to work because of lack of communication, lack of morale, and lack of help."
good,When I worked there they did not pay well I know they did an overhaul of pay but I am not sure what it looks like now. Work life wasn't great if you are full time the schedule you when they want you and wouldn't really work with my school schedule at the time. That may be a manager by manager basis though.
good,I was fired because they said I cashed a check and gave it back to the customer. The front end manager  only like certain people and let the do what they want
good,"The director that I had was mentally abusive. I came in to the roll from not knowing the culture of Wal-Mart and how things were done, so the curve was a little high.  If you can take the long thankless hours, this is the job for you."
good,"a typical day consisted of being a cashier and helping customers. When it came to needing assistance from management,they could care less and took their time resolving the issue even with customers waiting."
good,"A typical work day included cleaning around the lane area and maintaining the lines in my cashier short. At times when a CSM was needed it took a lengthly time before arriving therefore causing negative feedback from customers. I did enjoy getting to help customers and doing my job well that resulted in myself being rated high in my position. Some management were helpful, however, some of the higher up did not have much communication with basic employees. Overall, I learned how to keep up good speed and great communication skills while working in Walmart."
good,taking care of customers. i learned how to cash checks wire money to other places which i found to be interesting i would say the hardest part of the job was returning all the items from the whole day.
good,When I first work at Wal-Mart its was good for the past two years then when the add year came along everything went that the drain .poor management and pay not good at all.
good,My main gripe is  job security.   It seems like every six month they are   reorganizing and layoffs are random nobody knows if there job is secure.  While they provide assistance a chance to bid on other jobs in the company for 2 months after being laid off ?  Job opening don't match the amount laid off.
good,It's not a very family oriented place to work. When my spouse got diagnosed with a serious medical issue they were not willing to work with me at all on hours. Upper management wasn't nice at all(some were ok.)
good,As a cashier at Walmart you see different things and learn different things everyday. Some customers you get used to seeing. My job as a cashier I make my customers that come through my line are happy by time I’m done checking them out.
good,"Walmart was an experience I won't forget. I genuinely loved my co-workers, they were a lot if help. However it was unorganized in the fact that they always moved people from work stations, and management seemed to not communicated to each other."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart, It was a fairly easy job compared to my last job. I liked the fact that most of the time they were more cautious about employee health and safety but they will not stick up for employees and management will at times throw you under the bus. When I alerted my management of improper disposal of waste they said that there was no proof and when I made my point across they said they know more then I do on that subject. I was also yelled at for not making an illegal sale of tobacco to a 19-year-old national guard reservist who got Upset that I would not sell to him with his current ID card."
good,no matter how hard you work or how dedicated you are they still treat you like a number and just a warm body to fill the position to do their biding. they seem to think you are there just to serve them.
good,"There is opportunity to learn just about every facet of the retail business. The job and the environment can be overwhelming but if you are driven, curious, and willing to learn, you can do well with this company."
good,"Changes daily, not always for the better.  Promotions are predetermined, based on friends or family in Many situations.  Salary managers are taken for granted in Many decisions."
good,Truck unloader was the best entry level job i have had it was hard but the co workers is where the job was no longer a job but a family the boss was chill aswell
good,Walmart is a place where you can learn more skills needed for various other jobs such as warehouse work too customer services jobs Great place to grow
good,This was an interesting job which gave me the face to face experience of direct interaction with customers. 
good,"The ""open door"" policy that they seemed to pride themselves on does not exist. The company would rather fund their higher up associates then care two seconds for the lower employees such as the cashiers, over night stokers etc. They only offer the pay raises to employees who have finished their pathways which are impossible to complete do to the fact that you are not ever allowed to go into the back to complete them because you are swamped with customers at all times. Then you are not allowed to complete them on your lunch breaks because you are not allowed to do any work related activity off the clock. So the company is literally scamming their own employees just so that they can keep them underpaid, and less taken care of."
good,"Company has changed drastically during the 25 years I worked there.  It is no longer about the associate, their family, or about the customer.  It is now about driving the profit margin."
good,Walmart is not a place that I feel values their employees . They have strict policies and the management is often stressed and does not help you unless asked or something bad occurs . The actual on the job training for some departments leaves more to be desired . The most enjoyable part of the job is the hour lunch and two 15 minute breaks . They also pay well and if you find something you like they have decent benefits and ways to advance your career.
good,I Learned being part of a dynamic team and to work with customers the hardest part of the job . There was always someone to determine a bad day for you but need to by pass and  keep going It seemed it would always come from Management there was time I would like to get  ahead at Walmart for some reason was very hard  done my testing for Management and pass the test with  93 wish I was never given the opportunity to proceed .
good,Ive always love to work with ppl this job was positive  fun and exciting and fast moving being a cashier  you get yo know a person hear about their lives listen to them stories make the smile if u need to
good,hours are poor some moths you work full time others you work 12 hr a week. management is rather weak i would say. some managers are strict others don't care so its hard to figure out what to do and how to work sometimes.
good,Without being transferable the highest level of advancement is assistant Manager. The business is changing and it is for the good of the customer. Some positions are more appealing than others depending on your work life balance.
good,Not bad place to work but advancement is a pain. Management doesn't practice company values very well and tends to look out for it's favourites.  Working here can be very stressful with expectations that seem suspect.
good,"Not really that bad to work for but expect to by shuffled around and worked very hard especially if you work overnights, compensation is alright but if you start to make a good amount of money watch out because they will be looking for any reason they can find to let you go to keep payroll as low as possible."
good,The co-workers were great.  I enjoyed working there for the most part.  I did not like when management set unrealistic goals.  Job could be fun but also really stressful.
good,"Everyday is a new day. There always so much things to do and learn about how to take care of the department. manage to control inventory, putting items it away if the shelves are full. greeting customers and helping them find there items that there looking for. hardest part is picking up others slacks because it slow you down from what your suppose finish your task for the end of the day. Best part of the job is an hour lunch."
good,"I did not like working there. There were many problems that the BBB should know about, yet the managers refuse to fix the problems. Harassment was a constant issue."
good,I worked for WalMart for over 13 years. It is just like any other retail job. It had its ups and downs. Every part of the job was different. Every manager had some quirk that you had to learn to work around.
good,"There is a large need for supervision within a Walmart.  The turnover (created by fast pace, high expectation, and culture of disparaging people) is creating an environment that is occupying management's time with HR tasks rather than Operations tasks. Disparaging tones and attitudes should not be encouraged, yet they are at levels within the company where they should not be."
good,they wouldnt let me  promote from greeter to Cashier  internal politics  i was able and qualified to  do the job but they stonewalled me and dragged heals when a CSM tried to advocate for me
good,Very busy putting out fires. Lots of visits and completing of notes. Need additional time to teach and train. Utilize paperwork and wire for information. Lots of office requirements.
good,"Very quiet nights, mainly spent alone or with people you don't know so well. Hard to make friends with co workers. Incompetent coworkers who drop their workload onto others. I was greatly relied on and was never compensated or commended for my work. At times you feel like everything you did was for nothing as the next day comes and everything is either the same or worse than before. where a break in work means moving on to the areas that needed help from the imcompetent coworkers who never showed up or the lazy ones who cant handle working overnights."
good,Friendly nature is required having the drive patience and understanding to deal with the public. Customers can be difficult an you have to be able to let things go. Be able to work in fast pace with many disruptions.
good,the management are clueless. the store manager is rude and ignorant. but the workers are great. you do not get much hours unless you become management but it is not worth the stress for what little they pay
good,walmart is a great place to work but managers should care more about there team and stop worrying about them take time to understand and help us as a team i feel like sometimes theres no team it sucks they should appricate employes more .
good,Walmart has allowed me to develop great customer service skills while working in a fast paced environment. I have learned how to remain collected during the high stress times of the day and to perform tasks in a timely manner.
good,"You get hired in for part time, but have to work full time because someone was always calling out. There's no room for advancement unless you've been there for 10 years. No benefits, time off etc. The pay isn't where it needs to be."
good,I love most of the people I work with. The company is changing to keep up with Amazon and its making it hard for the employees to have a work/home life balance.
good,I was hired to be a cashier but majority of my hours were spent at the entrance greeting people. My manager for the time I was there was new and did not know how to handle her employees properly and chose to be friends rather than the manager.
good,It has been years since I was employed here. But I loved it when I could find a problem on the sales floor with pricing and I could go to the office to correct it and then I was reassured that a customer's product would scan at the correct price.
good,most the managers are there for social reason. they dont promote based on work ethics. the best part of the job was the end of the shift. they need to change their management team around and change how they promote
good,"Intense fast paced work environment with very small chance for advancement. I learned many things working at Walmart and they have taught me how to manage not only my time, but others."
good,"Customer service professional dedicated to effective team management and customer satisfaction. Management professional effective at building highly-motivated teams, as well as leading cross-functional teams in a fast-paced environment. Dynamic Customer Service Manager who leads diverse teams to achieve company goals. Ambitious Customer Service Manager experienced with managing complex projects and driving productivity improvement. Customer service management professional experienced in credit card services, fraud operations and collections. Team player with exceptional listening and critical thinking skills."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of opening or closing the photo department, cleaning, helping customers, put stock on floor and bining overstock, customer assistance in both the electronic department and the photo department, sending out film and receiving film and orders then filing when the came back in, ordering supplies,constructing photo products,selling and activating phones and phone cards.resolving issues."
good,laid back not stressful until people no longer want to talk to you because its the same people all the time inside walmart.  no more sale... means warnings and eventually termination
good,"Working at Walmart is not too bad, it just keeps you on your toes. A lot of the times you run into rude customers, but that's when you have to know how to deal with it."
good,"Management doesn’t really care about your needs. You will need to repeatedly ask for change. Scheduling is not consistent, so don’t expect a set schedule unless you narrow down your availability."
good,"excellent position. I really enjoyed my time working with this innovative company and believe there is a bright future as they move forward, I know they will achieve greatness"
good,Part of a caring work place is having a management team who will support their crew.  This doesn't happen.  Asking the opinion or listening to the opinion of your associates would go a long way.  This doesn't happen.  Had the management team taken into consideration the associates performing the day to day routine things may be different.
good,"a typical day of work at the wal-mart service desk consisted of helping the customers with whatever they needed:returns, exchanges, electronic billing (paying bills, transferring money, receiving money, cashing checks) answering questions that a customer may have or finding someone who can answer the question. i learned about electronic billing at the service desk.the management was sub par at best and usually meant that they only promoted favorite employees or people from other stores or hiring management directly instead of finding someone who was suited to do the job. hardest part of the job was keeping up with managements impossible demands. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping a customer who was to be helped and was open to different ideas."
good,"I did enjoy working with my crew and all the customers i encountered. The management set impossible goal for certain positions ( CAP 2 Supervisor), in my opinion is why they have such a high turnover rate on those positions."
good,The typical day at Walmart always consisted of not enough employees and not the right supplies. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers. I was fired while on leave for a knee replacement in which they paid for.
good,Productive fast paced workplace. Associate Management relationships are very strained. Favorite associates get first choice of shifts and management opportunities.
good,I have a solid 40 hour week. I don't mind customers and I actually enjoy customer assistance. Management though expects ridiculous amounts of work to be done for an understaffed team. Most members of management though are helpful and understanding of rough situations.
good,"Management was poor, The work was not bad, co-workers were friendly, Typical day at work was unloading a truck, stacking pallets and or pulling them out, Then rest of shift was stocking shelves."
good,"While trying to run multiple departments we were never able to complete our daily tasks due to management constantly pushing other work on myself and the associates. Daily cleaning and stocking was not held in as high regard as managements constant changes. When a system works and the departments are running the highest profit margins in the region, let them continue doing what they do. (If it ain't broke, don't fix it.) I am thankful for all the supervisor and management skills I learned on the job. It has made me better at being a Leader not just a manager. ."
good,"The pay at Walmart was pretty good: after you finished your training (which was pretty much a full year) you got a dollar raise. But if you have ANY medical conditions that may make you miss work, DON'T EVEN APPLY. I went through all of their hoops to file for medical leave of absence and it was denied anyway, so I lost my job for missing too many days of work."
good,well my typical workday consisted of down stacking pallets and stocking shelves for night time and morning customers the hardest part of the job was being in the freezer stocking milk
good,"I enjoyed most of my time at Wal-Mart.  I enjoyed stocking the shelves, processing the clothes, and then bringing them out to the sales floor for the customer to buy.  I enjoyed helping customers find what they were looking for.  The best part of the job was when a customer would come in and look for me because I had helped them in the past, and want my help again.  Sometimes it was difficult getting everything that needed to be done in a timely manner.  I enjoyed working in the fitting room; answering the phone, helping customers who called, helping customers try on clothes, and fielding calls that came in for management.  I was also trained as a cashier, and enjoyed helping people with that."
good,Wal-Mart is a big company and the associates can and do get lost in the shuffle sometimes. My personal experience was one that I would say was not very favorable to the needs of my family. Which is why I left the company when I did.
good,"I believe if they communicated more with their employees, it would be a good place to work.We have some very good assistant manager, once again the communication needs to be better. I also feel like they choose who they will let move up, instead of giving everyone a chance to move up."
good,Wal-Mart is ok.  Not as associate friendly as they can be.  They do try to accommodate you if you need ADA requirements.  No paid holidays.  you use your pto
good,Mi evaluación se debe a que el trabajo que se realiza no es bien remunerado debido a que los salarios son bajos y el trabajo realizado es muy competitivo y arduo.
good,Ahí conocí lo que es la Medicina Laboral y me motivó a seguirme capacitando en esa área.
good,"No communication with managers and department managers. One associate will do the job of three. Work schedules are very inconsistent, to be able to have a work schedule or some hours, you will need to put availability OPEN, no restrictions..."
good,"A typical day at work, standing position all day. Management not very friendly or helpful. Not enough co-workers to satisfy the customers. Not enough hours per day to satisfy employees."
good,"It seems that Walmart actually was a good place to work and I could see myself staying in that pharmacy for an extended period of time. Unfortunately, Corporste likes to change policies almost every quarter, so if you don’t keep up with the changes, chances are likely you won’t be there for long. I enjoyed my work environment, but personal situations conflicted with work causing an automatic termination following new policy changes."
good,"This was an ok place for a younger person to work. They seem to not work with certain schedules and making ""ends meat"" was kind of hard due to not enough hours."
good,The job was really brutal they wanted us to be in freezing temperatures at all times. We did not got the necessary breaks we was required to take. The work load was so much i began developing knee problems and back problems. Management staff always downed you and make it seem like you never did enough i would never go back to work for walmart
good,"Walmart is a stressful place to work, it can be amazing and a great career but only if you know the right people. I liked the fast pace of working as a cashier but it could be stressful and it felt like you always had to be the fastest or someone else would replace you. We had such a high turn over rate."
good,did not have a good experience. i wasn't treated fairly at all. I was under management that did not believe in advancement and did not want to work with my schedule
good,It's ok if you don't want to use your mind and follow through with the new program they roll out every other the day of the week  the workers are some good most don't have any customer service skills
good,Walmart more interested in profit and shareholders than in their employees.   Employees hours cut all the time to make profit. Store closings layoffs.
good,"I enjoyed working for them but was not appreciated and I worked so hard for them. You have no set schedule so you have to work around the schedule they give you. After your scheduled, they change your schedule and not even tell you then you get in trouble fr not showing up and they never informed you of the change."
good,"The job was absolutely terrible. The management was a joke. Any time you had a complaint, they hardly listened, and they never resolved anything, even if breaking the companies policy."
good,It's not the best atmosphere but the pay is fair and if you keep up good work and don't really cause confusion you'll be fine but it's nice place to work.
good,"Stressful and very strict "
good,enjoy doing my job but work place is stressful and daily changes are difficult to keep up. Company is more customer oriented than their employees. I like the girls I work with. I enjoy helping customers find what they are looking for.
good,"I love working for Walmart because of the benefits and hours, but the management are bad. No communication or respect for their employees hard work. I also hate We don't get holiday Pay Or Paid For maternity leave."
good,"It's all about the public image. Yes, they provide great benefits. Yes, they start you out at a great rate of pay. Yes, you do get yearly raises. This is all for their public image. The truth is that the $10 an hour they started someone with zero experience out with, doing the same job as someone that's been there 5 years and making $9. It no longer matters how great or terrible of an employee you are, because in February you will receive a 2% raise the same as everyone else. Which is 15 to 30 cents and approximately covers the new cost of insurance. So, in short you cannot get ahead."
good,"I really liked working @ Walmart, just felt like I had the wrong chain of command when balancing school, family & daily encounters on a daily basis without the encouragement of my superiors"
good,Their vacation hours program sucks. Hourly associates treated like they dont matter. The higher up bosses ignore the lower management screwing everything up.
good,"I loved my position at Walmart and worked there for many years. But as an HR professional I was consistently dismayed and disappointed in how undervalued and underutilized the function was. The most senior executive HR positions were always held by operations leaders waiting for their next Ops role. Field HR is tactical and administrative and spread VERY thin, considering each store does not have an HR manager. Little opportunity for advancement unles you want to move to Bentonville Arkansas."
good,Their equal opportunity employment is not real equal. Was harassed by a manager the entire time i was employed there because i have severe anxiety. And was downgraded frequently for reporting it.
good,It was alright working for the company but the hours would always seem to change. the managers were nice and helpful. I found out that if you got injured on the job that they would not pay the medical bill. I got hurt on the job and got stuck with a 300+ dollar bill from the er. they refuse to pay for the bill and even denied me working for the company.
good,"I worked as deli associate at WalMart. What I liked most, is the fast pace. I enjoyed each and every customer. And over time I had customers asking for me. I also got regular customer feedback."
good,"My typical day at work was to provide good customer service, maintain my area organize and clean. Deal with returns, refunds, exchanges. Also cash checks, payments, send/receive money and money orders."
good,"It was really easy to get hired. I applied online and the next day i called, asked to speak to personnel and i was asked to come in for an interview 4 days later. after i passed the background check i got the job. the first week or so was a lot of training which consisted of sitting at a computer watching boring pointless videos and answering redundant questions for 8 hours a day. it was so boring i nearly fell asleep, but the faster you get through it the faster you can get on the floor to do your actual job. Work on the floor is easy too. my suggestion is to please every customer you can and stay out the businesses of your co-workers and don't let them get to much into yours."
good,There is never a typical day & depending upon your job area you will be required to do things that you werent hired to do. The management varies by stores so its a roll of the dice what you end up with.
good,Walmart would be a great place to work if it was not for management.   They need more training in employee relations.  Walmart does provide an environment for growth.
good,"Very fast-paced, ach day is stressful, a complete multi tasking day, consisting of management, vender and customer requests."
good,I just feel like I was not treated right and I did more then what was needed to be done I even helped on dealing with things that was out of my power I was a on top of it type guy at walmart
good,Staff was nice but very negative. Management was decent for the most part but was hit or miss. Had one manager that I would go work for in a heart beat. Also had some very poor manager's that did not work out well.
good,"Each store has a different culture my suggestion is to go to the store that your considering employment. Additionally, walk around and speak with other worker they will be glad to tell you about the store's management and operations."
good,"as a good job a lot of hours in the summer and holidays but they cut them a lot in the time in between. a lot of manager but never around when you need one, very stressful if you're not used to retail"
good,"I spent Over two year's with Walmart and Never had the chance to Move up, Favoritism plays a huge part in Walmart's Management Not speaking for every store But at least the one i worked at!"
good,"My typical day at work is not easy. I clock in and get supervisor keys, then I'm told on some days to perform out-of-the-way tasks before I can even get to my area. When I get to my area, cashiers and other CSMs are telling me several different requests and notes for the day within 15 seconds. Some of the other CSMs don't even work; others will be lazy when a certain person is working. On most days I am forced to carry the workload of at least 5 supervisors. With that much of a workload, coupled with constant instruction and intimidation from management, I've eventually had panic attacks and was forced by a medical professional to take a leave of absence. Upon returning from leave, nothing has changed; in fact, the work environment has gotten worse. This is a hostile and toxic work environment. For me the most enjoyable part is when I get a break, so I can have some time to clear my head."
good,"Walmart is sometimes fast sometimes slow, management is alright but can be slow. the people can be mean and stressful, but the biggest problem for me is that Christmas is the only holiday off and I have to work thanksgiving weekend including the thanksgiving day. there arn't very many benefits I received from Walmart, save for a discount card, all my insurances I have to pay for myself."
good,It started out nice and cool. Managers started treating you bad if you wasn’t someone they knew for a while or if you didn’t kissed butt but the managers are lazy and they don’t do much. They don’t give us all the recourse you need to help the night go better.
good,"With Walmart I worked a lot of overtime, its very fast paced and customer oriented. I liked my job at Walmart but management made it hard to love the job."
good,"Lo que más me gustó de trabajar en esta empresa fue el trato directo con el cliente, el ambiente de trabajo en mi área era divertido."
good,"It is a good place to work, friendly and calm."
good,"really good job if there wasn't favoritism, backroom politics and high school drama. enjoyed going to work everyday unless I was put down for being in the wrong place at the wrong time when a manager is stressed out"
good,Walmart was a good place to work. All the coworkers got along easily and stayed in touch outside of work. Each coworker helped coworkers that needed help and it was over all a very fun place to work.
good,Bien el ambiente de trabajo auq un poco bajos los sueldos y trabajas 9 horas diarias
good,"I have been with this company for almost ten months. I was supposed to be hired on full time, was working 40 hours a week. When it came time to enroll for benefits I was unable to, when i asked why I was told it's because I'm part time. They then said that you have to work full time hours for 12 weeks in a row to be bumped from full time to part time. I was on week 11, the next week they cut me down to 30 hours and I was unable to receive full time status or benefits. They then kept my hours low until around christmas where I began averaging 34 hours a week, and then they would ask me to stay for overtime, with no overtime pay until i reached 40 hours. It is now. In this time frame we received a bonus, but because i was ""technically part-time"" I only received $16 out of almost $400 of the bonus. NOW it is after the holidays and hours are cut even more, with the average being about 30 hours a week and dropping... Anyways what I'm trying to say is unless you find a place with good management that won't screw you over I DO NOT RECOMMEND!! I have tried multiple times to get my hours back and they just tell me there is nothing I can do."
good,"While Wal-Mart has a good and productive work place, the managers and supervisors can be very rude and try to be competitive with one another. I don’t recommend applying for the job unless you can hold your temper to the managers and supervisors. Not all of the managers and supervisors are ridiculously rude. However, in Wal-Mart #1035, the store manager is very un-qualified for there position and while they may try to keep the store in perfect shape and make it presentable to the public, they didn’t  grasp the full responsibility of their position. A manager is supposed to listen to his/her employees and keep charge of making sure everyone did there job as intended. Communication is a big error in the company because hardly any member of management would listen to there employees and some managers and supervisors would have you do something completely different from your job so they could say there Department was being productive when in actuality they had you do there job for them. This may be how chain of command works at Wal-Mart, but not to me. Each and every person has a responsibility in there position and that’s how it should be."
good,Walmart is a face paced competitive workplace. It is not very welcoming to people with mental issues. They do not allow for people to call out sick without consequences or future termination. they are run by a 9 strike system
good,A typical day at work consist of locating your manager and asking where you were suppose to be or what you are suppose to do that day . It may switch throughout the day but don't complain or you'll here stimuli doing something you actually hate till you can have a better attitude
good,it was my first job i was super excited but they didnt pay close attention to me. they let the computers show us how to do everything but i like to learn hands on. they were in a hurry to hire so many people at the time because of inventory and i asked if they were able to work around my schedule when school came around and they got lazy about it and i didnt have much time left before i had to go back to school. they moved me to almost every department everyday so i was having a hard time know where everything is.
good,"se aprenden muchísimas cosas todos los días, aunque los horarios son muy pesados algunas veces."
good,Walmart was an okay place to work if your manager was willing to help but they have high turnover rates which makes it hard to work with people on a consistent basis.
good,My store was way too small for any career advancement. I could not relocate because there was not a store close enough. I was at my store for three years.
good,"poor pay, lots of hours when I asked for them. lots of worker and management turnover, stability was not there. Lots of hours due to the turnover rate. Worked 12-14 hour days"
good,As far as I experience the store I worked for was uncomfortable with Department Managers  they showed Favorite employees and never helped me when I asked for assistance.  Even I asked for Tools such as price changer and printer  they never obliged to my request to make my job easier.
good,"I love interacting with people and seeing that what I was doing does make a difference. However, the managers needs to be more understanding and willingness to teach instead of demanding."
good,"As an associate this was ideal as a college student."
good,A fresh start of the day of preparing bread and donuts for the day. To make a good quality. Work as a team and get work done. Take care of freight and fill the floor. Sometimes it is hard when you less people working and you get allot of freight in. To see the customers satisfaction in the quality of product.Management helps keep things in order and to help in problem solving.
good,The work environment was pretty ok for the most part except for some managers in training that came for short periods and my advisor. Management wasn't a problem until my daughter was born and they wouldn't change my availability as I was also attending college at the time.Some nights felt long but my fellow employees at the time made it good. The hardest part of the job for me was probably zoning at the end of the night because I'd be tired or trying to finish large truckloads. The most enjoyable parts of the job for me were helping some customers that became regulars and working with fellow employees. Overall I liked working there and I'd do it again given an opportunity.
good,"This company provided for many years for y family, the job became challenging with staff and management making impossible to have a normal life. It also didn't allow you to focus on important compliances because most days you are the only manager the building running a 100 million store."
good,There were great managers and associates but in the end some of their policies make since and others don't. When I left a lot of what I was getting talked to about was my tattoos when Walmart really doesn't have a tattoo policy unless they were offensive. which mine were not and are not still do this day. their attendance policy sucks because there were people that called out more than I did but yet I got fired for such.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at Walmart. I learned fast for my job duty. I learned you have to watch people carefully due to high risk of theft. Management up there is amazing especially the store manager. Sometimes i had late breaks and lunches, but if I wasn't almost due i would still be working there right now. I didn't like the fact i had resign my job due to the fact that wouldn't work my maternity leave."
good,"enjoyed at first, then became very boring. management was ok. co workers were awesome. good work environment. I enjoyed working with the customers. Walmart isn't as bad as people thinkl"
good,Walmart is a decent place to work if you are in school or just need a part time. Overall it wasn't that hard of work. Management is overall relaxed but it doesn't seem like there is much advancement opportunity.
good,"I worked in the bakery so I was left to myself for the most part, I did run the bakery by my self there was really no help when needed. Didn’t really know my coworkers either"
good,"there was room for me to grow in this corporation and there wasn't no consistence with my hours, but I was able to learn different areas in the company so im grateful for all the experience that they offer me"
good,"we unloaded trucks and stocks merchandise. i learned how to stock, use the forklift and invest in stock. management was racist and very judemental. the workplace was cool due to everyone not being so disrespectful to each other. the hardest part was taking other people slack when they didnt show up for work, which caused double the work on the crew. the most enjoyable part of the job was learning how the store really operates"
good,Walmart has its prows and cons but overall its a ok place to work. I made a they want to hide and act as if working ..being a personal shopper is not a joke!!you walk all day long and shop..(by the end of the day a person usually doesn't feel like shopping for themselves!!!
good,Lots of computer work. You get 2 days a week off. It's pretty laid back but can be stressful at times. Depending on position you can work at your own pace.
good,"The job wasn’t bad it just wasn’t good the people were rude, managers never told anyone what they were supposed to be doing and some racial tension was shown as well."
good,the staff including co-workers were helpful and team spirited. Everyone worked together to get the job done no matter how big or small. the hardest part of the job was moving large and heavy items
good,Very fast paced job. Not much down time always busy. Exhausting stressful job wouldn't recommend it for anyone. Work too hard for little pay and no benefits
good,"I worked here almost 2 years, I had never worked retail in my life before. I didn't feel like it was the best place for me to start in retail. I enjoyed assisting most of the customers and got along okay with coworkers and staff."
good,"The days working at wal-mart was very fast-paced and sometimes stressful. some I would run into rude customers, so I'm good at turning a negative situation into something positive."
good,"While made some friends there, they were always understaffed. Couldn't work overtime and always got off late. No one seemed to know proper policies since every management team told us something different."
good,New management has been brought in and is trying to change the culture.  It is no longer the Walmart your parent knew...  Layoffs are becoming a common thing.
good,"The management team are all for there bonus. You can rate your employees as a low level manager, however, if you rate them honestly your management team will overturn the sign off you had saying we cant do anything about employees who don't perform properly."
good,"Between assisting customers and monitoring shelf availability there is always work to keep you busy.  "
good,"people used to work with Walmart now people work for Walmart ,the Company no longer cares about the people working for its all about what you can do for Walmart ."
good,"Not sure I would ever go back with the way workers are treated, and how you are only a number to the company and easy to replace.  Pay does not reflect the amount of work that you put in."
good,"Originally it was a reasonably good job for pretty decent pay. As time went on, my team was used to fill in other peoples absences and got thrown around all the time. That caused management to get mad at us because we couldnt complete out daily tasks. That lead to people on my team ignoring orders and getting told we would get in trouble if we didnt complete evdrything. A very hostile environment."
good,I enjoyed the people but the workload and system wasn't a conducive work environment.  I would only work at Wal-Mart if I needed a job to survive. I worked in loss prevention/asset protection.
good,It is a good place to work fun fast paced the only problem is management and communication. The other employees are great always willing to help someone that has questions or needs assistance
good,"To put it in short when i worked there i had no life outside work."
good,"Don't work here, the management is terrible. The management seems to not know what they are doing half the time, it creates a very stressful work environment for everyone. I have seen so many people leave because if it."
good,When your talk to management about your schedule and availability they always blame the automated system week after week. Not to mention they have no clue how each department works and don't hold dept managers accountable for sales floor counts
good,"Days at Walmart was long and tedious. The employees I work with were knowledgeable  of their jobs . My manager was great to work with, he made coming to work fun.  The hardest part of the job was having  District  and Regional Managers who weren't all on the same page."
good,Management was wonderful to work with but just not the right environment for me. The culture is overall what made me leave because it wasn't the right place for me. Everyone is kind and it can be both relaxed and stressful depending on position
good,"too many hours in one day, worse thing many times you don't work your full schedule. many manager have their own rules as who to hire permanent as who to give opportunities to advance."
good,"I learned patience,how to rememeber customers,be kind at all times,smile,be curtious be on time ,discipline, responsible how to organize ,be respectful on time"
good,"I enjoyed my job at Walmart.  I was asked several times to cover for employees who called out.  I would work double shifts to cover the shortage.  I always felt I went above and beyond my calling.  However, Walmart works on a point system and any discrepancies were given points.  I always tried to come in early to help out and got points for doing that."
good,"Workplace culture does not coincide with the company's core values in some stores. I can't say its like that in all stores, but it was with the ones I worked in."
good,"Working at Walmart was a very confusing environment. Numerous of managers would tell you different directions and to complete there tasks in a certain amount of time. Most of the time I would get it done, but the other managers try to over power the other managers on which tasks should be completed first. Overall In enjoyed working with the customers and employees, it taught me to have/respect and to multitask."
good,"You're working with 100+ other people. Every Walmart is run like 3 stores--customer service, grocery/fresh food and inventory. You can get lost among the other employees."
good,"Working at Walmart was good, until the management started creating lie about employees work performance. Since her lies many people were laid off or let go from their job."
good,"The work place was easy to learn, but had some minor challenges. It can be fast paced during rush times, or seasonal times. Time management was key due to business and Stock needing to be put away."
good,"Walmart is a great company , I would refer people to work at Walmart. It’s an awesome experience and your working at your own pace , i enjoyed putting a smile on every one of my customers faces , and if your having a bad day you can almost always count on the customers to put a smile on your face"
good,"was a decent job in the beginning but after many years it became more about profit then people. At the end I was let go for a minor safety violation that was rarely enforced but was told they would gladly rehire me back in 60 days at the entry level position I had, of which I had been in the position over 10 years."
good,"The pay is only marginally better than other entry level jobs but working for Walmart will make you lose your faith in humanity. "
good,The experience to work as a summer intern was great. However two Saturday morning manager meetings were mandatory for us interns. Great technical experience with their systems department.
good,A typical day at work can range from relaxed to stressful depending on how your manager feels that day or if they are present. I've learned how to better deal with conflict with customers and how to block negativity from other workers. The people that work for this company as associates seem to dislike their job for what they do but stay for the pay that comes with it. The associates that have worked at the company longer will stay for the benefits the company provides. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking to customers and getting to know my coworkers.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co workers while unloading the truck. It helped me with my communication skills, be more social and meet new friends. They made the job tolerable for the job as a whole was stressful. The job itself wasn't hard but the standards/expectations that management wanted from us was insane. As in, they required us to unload the truck in maybe 2 hours or less but we can't do that when we have so little people to work with. The people on your team sometimes vary since not everyone have the same work days but work the same hours nonetheless from 2 to 11 pm. You find yourself getting a workout from moving so much, pushing, pulling and lifting items constantly because of that deadline. I lost weight doing this job. Our jobs were to unload the truck of its items and stock them later. Management is odd to say the least."
good,"Employees are treated like their stupid by management and I have worked at three difference locations, each being the same. Employees get so frustrated with Wa-Mart and management that they hate on each other. People still strive to make it with the pay rate and part time and no benefits. I had my lunch stolen on multiple occasions but couldn't blame them."
good,Wal Mart is a very practical job for those taking classes or looking for another place to find a job. Opportunities to climb happen very often and they are willing to work around your schedule.
good,"I don’t ever want to have to work at Walmart again. It wasn’t the worst place but I prefer not to be just a number, and that’s what you are there. :))"
good,Retail is an exciting ever changing type of environment and isn't for everyone.  I enjoyed my time but it was becoming less about the people and more about the bottom line.
good,My review of walmart is this. There was to much favortism at the walmart i worked at. Letting one do and not the other do. Management are cut throats.
good,"stressful, long days, and lack of being trained.  staff was excellent.  manager was new and not very good at training.very short staffed and expectations were unrealistic."
good,"Seemed to be very unorganized, non professional managers, I enjoyed working there because of my team i worked with. I enjoyed the physical aspect of the job, they helped me learn quickly. Its very physically demanding job and organization skills are a must. As a team member i helped a lot when managers or team leads were not in or not available that day, but was never offered compensation or a promotion."
good,It overall is not a bad pace to work but since the work force is 98% Hispanic of course that is the people they cater to. They could try and bridge the gap so that the Americans don't feel so left out
good,When it gets busy you need to keep up and always take care of your customers.You can learn a lot from your customers.Management will leave you alone if you are doing your job.
good,"No ""typical day"", was all over when ever they wanted or needed, had no routine. Would even have to work things that were outside job description. Hours were inconsistent, would work 40 hours for several weeks then have a 16 hour week to keep from being classified as fulltime and avoid benefits, was not choice but how the store manipulates employees. Mangers would say okay to something then never follow up, they were only around when they needed something around but never made self available for employees with issues."
good,"A typical day: rude customers and lazy workers "
good,"Clock in, speak with your department manager about todays projects, can sometimes be moved to other areas, managers can be very stressful and inpatient."
good,Pay isn't very good and they don't work with you for your hours. would require a lot of your time to make the schedule good for you but plenty of opportunity to move up
good,"Working at Walmart was fast paced, but along with that you can be forgotten about by management and end up working a eight hour shifts without breaks."
good,How to get along with coworkersHow to work with a team of peopleWorking at a fast paceWork with heavy machineryHeavy liftingOverall not a bad place to get experience
good,Depending on the position that you are in the typical work day can change. My most recent position at Wal~Mart was a sales floor associate so the typical job duties were to pull inventory from back room bins and place it on the shelves in the appropriate department. Always making sure that the area is neat and clean and organized. I learned a great deal from working at Wal~Mart this job gave me the majority of my retail work experience. Unfortunately. management at my particular store was the reason that I left. The store manager refused to get on board with Company wide changes and assistant managers could not control their department managers and the department managers left their work for others to do. The hardest part of the job was being good at your job because it meant you did everyone else's job. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to complete a task.
good,"I liked the job because I was able to work as many hours as I would like, but I could not pick my schedule, and I always felt like I was kept longer because I was younger."
good,"very stressful, management did not back up associates, there was a lot of favoritism towards some associates. Some members of management were  rude to the associates under them. No opportunity for advancement."
good,Nothing to add at this time because I don't really intend on working there much longer.  Very tiring job to stand in one spot all eight hours.It really hurts the feet
good,Management has a meeting with the associates before every shift to assign workers to areas with certain time for the freight that is on the floor to be worked before the shift is over. The hardest part about third shift stocking is time management we have a certain amount of time to finish the freight and have it off of the floor before our customers are back in the store in the morning. Being a GM Stocker I enjoy the feeling of getting the job done with time to clean my area before we open the store to customers in the morning.
good,"Management will throw you to the wolves and not help. They make you deal with the difficult customers on your own. The employees were all nice. They were the most enjoyable part about the job , being able to meet new people and joke around at times. I learned here that management does not really care if the store falls apart."
good,Working for Wal-Mart can be a challenge. The work environment is good. Sometimes the managers can be tough on you. The pay is ok. Wal-Mart is all about the customers.
good,"Great place to work. Lots of enteraction with many types of people. A lot of oportunities to learn new skills, ranging from costomer service to team building."
good,"Company struck or hard to work for. Have favorite's, hard to advance looking for younger associate's. Manager's do not follow policy or procedure guideline."
good,This is a great company in the benefits kind of way. But management is poor and no processes are done correctly. Most of this is because of staffing. Not enough pay for what they ask from you.
good,it would be a great easy place to work but do to rude management and the cutting of hours it has become very stressful. there is little to no communication  between managers so there is a lot of double working.
good,"A lot of politics are involved. There is a significant amount of pressure to advance, negative reinforcement if you choose not to. No understanding of time off due to illness. The best aspect of the job is the people you service."
good,Walmarts overnight crew can be incredibly stressful  the amount of work you are required to do can be overwhelming and the do not treat employees equally. however the pay is much better then other entry level positions and i do recommend it if you can work overnights and dont mind being stepped on from time to time.
good,"while the stock set up walmart the corperation provides is actually very robust, the type of people that are allowed to raise to the top of the management chain are frequently rage monsters with a massive ego."
good,"Its nice to work during the Holidays as its a festive place to work .It's "
good,"at the beginning of night I would line up 14 grocery carts to ready for processing of apparel, basics and table items. racks were used to hang clothing, overstock was marked and brought to back room and then zoning of tables and walls till shift ended. I learned to organize and plan out my night by the amount of freight that had to be worked. There were nights when I was the only one who worked apparel otherwise I had two other co-workers. Management was changing quite often and it seemed as though every time you turned around there was someone new. The hardest part of working at Walmart was doing the best job you could do and watching others play around, come back from lunch late and just the laziness that I observed. I enjoyed leaving in the morning knowing that I had accomplished a great deal and took pride in my work, I have taken pictures and have an album of areas I zoned."
good,"Loved my job at the beginning, however when management changed, hours got cut, employees weren't happy anymore."
good,"The management is really laid back when they want to be. The job itself is not really that hard as long as you are great with the public and good with money then your set. My typical day at work is not really that exciting like Walmart can be very busy, make time go so fast or it can be very slow and you could just be standing there."
good,"wal mart was not my favourite place to work, found some management hard to communicate with, others were fine, long hours, hard work for not much recognition, wasn't for me. hate to say bad things and not all people find it a hard place to work,"
good,I wasn't at Walmart long. I was a mother of two toddlers trying to make a living. It was not easy.  I worked full time. While at work there was constant drama and not much attention to detail unless you did something wrong. Other employees damaged departments of people that they didn't like.
good,A typical work day at Walmart consists of helping customers find any merchandise that will help make their lives easier or simply something they desire that is sold in store and working in the backroom to push out any merchandise that is needed on the sales floor. It is a friendly workplace and customers are usually grateful for the help provided by associates.
good,"This is a great company to work for but you do work a lot! You learn a lot but it comes at a price. "
good,their management is not the best and they do not do well with working around your availability they show some favoritism their training is done poorly and they do not always come when needed
good,"The managers play favorites real bad. If one manager didn't like you, they all didn't like you. You would get a write up for no reason. They expected you to do the whole store by yourself."
good,"Wal-mart may be a great place to work for some people, but it wasn't for me. It was day time work and I really just did not like the management over the department."
good,"Miscommunication is rampant. Once you hit a supervisory role it is hard to advance out of it, even with a proven record of success. Training is lacking and inconsitant, along with coaching system."
good,"Hourly roles are decent, salary roles treated like slaves, given little support or the resources needed to complete work without putting in lots of extra time."
good,"The job is average for a salary manager, 10-12 hour shifts. Walmart expects no one to have a life outside of their job. Management is very stressful and demanding."
good,I like it at Walmart it was a good job to work at but it is your  customer do want they want it the store and it is not  fair to the workers. All way working hard with my  coworker and not  complaining about anything. I got my work done and  went home
good,"It is a nice place to work , but only for a certain time period because it is a really stressful place to work. There is a lot of tasks that management wants done, basically it is just a lot to handle at one time. I learned a lot  from time management to multitasking. The management team were nice people, but to me they need to learn to compromise with each other and to not really have favorite people. The culture was very diverse like there was a lot of different people. The hardest part was having to do a lot of task in a certain time length. The most enjoyable part was being able to learn from well experience management team members."
good,"Walmart is a good starting company. I have been there for two years and some months now. I love working overnights. However, Walmart is now forcing overnights to go to either cap 1 or 2 without options. Some of us can't do it because of family issues."
good,"Tenia buen ambiente de trabajo,pero sueldo bajo y no hay oportunidad de crecer profecionalmente."
good,A typical day at Walmart was not bad as long as you did not mind taking up slack for some of the other workers. Working in the main shop was  good. But working in the pit to change oil was a little bit different. The pit was smelly it had low ceiling and very very slick. All the tools were covered in oil. But after all it is an oil service area. The shop manager was a pretty good person to work for.
good,"Some areas are physically demanding, but overall it keeps you busy. Management can be frustrating at times with constant scheduling issues. Most workers are polite and friendly."
good,Around the time they are almost up for an audit they have you working like 12 hour shifts and working all 7 days doing overtime as well. they don't like giving days off
good,"I learned how to open close deli use food equiptment, order freight, worked on holidays was a very busy day but fun atmosphere. Manager was not personable an no communication"
good,"Literally just Walmart, everyone's experience depends on who is in charge and how well they are taught. There really isn't much of a way around it, especially since the essence of Walmart is not much else."
good,I think Walmart love their customers. The Walmart I worked at was very strict on customer service and the front end. We would always have to agree with the customer even when wrong. The store manager wanted the store to be perfect and he wanted the associates to work hours outside of their requested hours.
good,"The job isnt bad, what is bad is the new scheduling and the management. Home office changed the schedule that if you're not available at 7 but at 8, you will not get scheduled because its not what the system wants you to work. also the management is so bad and rude to their employees."
good,"Overall the job is alright of a job, but if you take in to mind of the poor excuse of management then it is a horrible job. Management is unprofessional, refuse to take action on serious incidents occurring at work, and all around disrespectful to fellow employees."
good,This is a good company to work for schedules are flexible and can work around so you can have a life balance. There is some room for advancement but many times it depends on who you know. The salaries could be better. They don't look at previous experience.
good,I worked at the distribution center. Lots of different shifts to choose from. Benefits are not bad. The company cuts back on perks a little every year.
good,"enjoyed the customer service work and enjoyed doing stocking or restocking, really liked my co workers and the manager at the time. but they do not accept dr excuses so you cannot get sick or you are fired"
good,"Empresa com excelente nivel de aprendizado, dinâmica, possibilidades de crescimento e respeito com seus associados."
good,this was my first job so when i first started it was great. i loved my manager she gave me opportunities to move around the store and learn almost every department VOLUNTARILY. that was probably my worst decision because then they started needing me to go everywhere in the store and do so many tasks. its a good job at first but after a while management sucked and it was time for me to go because i needed to be working in the medical field and walmart was no longer the place for me.
good,"The pay is decent, but the stress is high.  The individual is not valued, only results.  There are good benefits packages if you are single, but, for a family, insurance is very high.  Upper management is very detached from daily operations and from associate concerns."
good,did not like managers worked you like it is a factory. was always messing up on schedule.  The managers wanted to work you like you were getting paid for production.
good,You are held accountable for a lot. They don't give you any room for error. The management I had worked with were not professional in any way! They have there records of conversations out where customers and other employees can over hear.
good,"I worked the night shift-10 pm-7 am. All I can say is, that you have to be a special person who can work hard when everyone else is asleep. It can cause social problems unless all of your friends are on the night shift also, Getting up during the day and doing things was hard. "
good,"I learned to have patience, to work with speed and accuracy and how to multitask on more than two objectives. The work place is always busy and one will always need help; always help one in need in advance."
good,Started off good but to much manager having contact with regular associates. Once management don't like you anymore everything goes down hill and they no longer care about you .
good,the environment was good but the managers do not acknowledge their employees unless they worked in your department. they walk right by employees and don't speak.
good,"Es una empresa muy absorbente realmente vives ahi, llevan una cultura que no profesan, trabaje casi 7 años y en mi experiencia debi salirme dessde el primer año yo no la recomendaria como una empresa para hacer carrera y ahora que me sali me niegan las referencias laborales"
good,"Wal-Mart is not a bad place to work they kept me busy and I did learn many things with them. I loved the fact that you could buy and sell stocks through them, the only thing with them is its very hard to be a full time employee with them most of their employees are part time I was lucky to get full time hours its hard to get requested time off unless your under a good assistant manager. Many things have changed since I last worked there I still keep in touch with many of my co workers like they say your a Wal- Mart family this is very true."
good,"Start with exercises, learned QA, typical on any warehouse management, needs more work on culture, waiting response time on RF scanner and needs to update their systems and equipments. My co-workers."
good,"The pay is good, but it is very stressful. The management at the Walmart I worked at was very poor. It is very fast pasted so if you did to decide to work there atleast your day goes by quickly."
good,"management only cares about numbers. They SAY they have an ""open door"" policy about associate concerns, but truth is they don't. A complete lack of training."
good,They get pretty busy! Extremly busy come holidays and when everyone gets off work. Hours vary from week to week. One week you have 40 the next you have 20. They normally can fix that or you can go to another department.
good,Was a job with routine daily schedules. Every day came with challenges to overcome. Friendly work environment without a supervisor over your shoulder watching every move.
good,"In the pharmacy you have to be a people person. The pharmacist sets the tone. If the pharmacist is not friendly.. it can be a long long day. You are called back to any role and it is all hands on deck.  Hard to move up, at store level."
good,"Whether you are an associate or department manager, the job is very stressful. The managers expect you to do more than just your job. It's not worth it."
good,"It is a fast pace environment to work at, it can be very stressful as well. I personally think that I get underpaid for the things that I do. On a daily basis there is a lot of different things that go on at once."
good,"a typical at work is quiet, everyone doing their work and answering calls and helping out customers, restocking shelves and organizing discs and help customers solve questions they have on products."
good,"working in team based environment, however, always under staffed, management does not assist when needed, hours are fair, compensation not so fair, I would only recommend this to someone"
good,"Walmart was very unhealthy work place, because they was a lot of politics and gossip between associates and managers, if you were  friend with a manager, your job was safe."
good,"I enjoyed working at WalMart, I met a lot of people, college students, and made a lot of friends. It was Christmas season so management at times asked for over time."
good,Walmart taught me how to have tough skin as well as to multitask and lead/follow when working as a team. I've worked in teams and on solo projects. I've also gotten customer compliments.
good,"I've worked at Walmart for seven years. It has become a second home to me, and I make good pay where I am. I feel like I need to branch out to a new career. For me, and my daughter. The management is poor in my facility. I want to be happy when I go into work every day."
good,I did not mind the labor I worked here at all and thought it to be great exercise! Backroom work was always great. But the biggest issue I had was with the management. They were very harsh and constantly yelled at their employees. I understand you have to be aggressive but you should never curse out a new employee and tell them to disobey company policies.
good,"A typical day in the Walmart deli is generally laid back. Every now and then is gets busy but for the most part you are never struggling to keep up with the customers. The hardest part of the job for me was remembering the numbers for all of the items items that go out of the deli. The most enjoyable part is customers, everyone is different and everyone has different needs."
good,"Work environment satisfactory, if you have ambition and want to move up it can be made possible if you can get along with management. Not a place for the lazy."
good,"A typical day usually includes answering questions for customers and resolving issues with their electronic devices. Despite the fact that it is a retail job, I have learned so many valuable life lessons that I can carry with me into both in my personal and professional life. I have always believed that you should be able to gain something positive from any experience. Management overall was good. My direct managers are superb. I have met many great people (employees and customers alike). If your are someone who covets interpersonal interactions, then this is truly a great place to start."
good,"I have nothing else to tell about my experiences at this store.  I'm just disappointed when I was left alone because some employee called in, in which at that time was my few days of working in the deli."
good,"Required excellent customer service skills and standing for hours. Thinking on your toes if something went wrong and good math skills."
good,"fast pace, the managers were great, they work with you with your school schedule and any other priorities you have and they have a good pay, even though I wasn't there for that long, I heard from co workers that the benefits were good and they give us good breaks and always a working as team."
good,"No job security. Was told often that my job was ""safe"" then one day was laid off, out of nowhere. There are rounds of corporate layoffs several times per year. CEO is good, but the ""no cash registers in the home office"" attitude kills morale."
good,Walmart is a great company and there are a lot of opportunities for growth. If you are looking for a challenge and looking for growth then this is the company for you.
good,"Working as a csm is stressful at walmart if you dont have a good manger who knows how to schedule for the front end and if they dont give you enough cashiers to work with... The customers always upset with you even when its out of your control and poor management is the real reason behind the lack of customer service. They make it hard for you to do your job properly or provide good customer service. Mangement throw you out to the wolfs and you have to learn pretty much on your own, they never provide you with enough workers for you shift, and they dont  pay you enough for the  stressful work Load they place on you..but it can be a good starter job until you get something better"
good,"A high volume, fast paced, retail environment with clear expectations and direction, where change is the only constant.  An industry leader in evolving technology and systems that challenges a Managers growth daily.  Excellent  exposure to all aspects of retail operations through constant movement of Managers between locations and areas.   "
good,"Walmart has a bad wrap for the really creepy people that have a tendency to shop there but the people that are part of management are pretty nice. Most people that work for Walmart are kind and have had a hard time getting a job. "
good,Walmart is an okay place to work. I have no complaints however some other employees tend to act rude. I would still recommend working there to anyone.
good,walmart is a good place to work at but the pay wasnt good and sometimes the managers dont believe u over the customers. some customers arent always right. sometimes they just try to get over on the company
good,"Overall walmart wasnt the place for me might be for some people but not me, it was stressful when I worked there wasnt enough people to get our job complete."
good,Working for Wal-Mart has been a fun and challenging experience. It is a hand full keeping everything in is place in each department. Dealing not only with your coworkers but with over a thousand customers that come in is a challenge.
good,"Its ok, alot more involved than what most people would think.  Pay is ok, but could be better for long term associates.  Some management could care a bit more about associates."
good,"Bom local de trabalho."
good,"it was an ok place to work. I didn't care much for the management.  I thought they were a little biased.  not much room for advancement, but I stuck it out"
good,"Walmart at first was quite enjoyable job to work for  because everyday was  always a new  task to handle and the managers at first had made the attempt to divide up the work that needed to be done so that coming in each day did not feel stale. But as time went on and new managers had come in the any attempt to vary the work became the same and no mangers had ever seemed to take any employee input.  Many employed had to  pester mangers over the course of weeks to see any action with regard to changing shift times, to requesting days off and even work accommodations. Walmart does however attempt to stick to its vale of making employees feel like family by having large lunches together during the holidays and seeking employee involvement for events."
good,"I have learned a lot about customer service and dealing with unhappy individuals. I have also developed a relationship with my regular customers and know them on a first name basis. Management seems to be unfair and show favoritism at times. When hired on, management assured me that they would work with my school schedule but they seem to lack interest in working with my schedule once I was hired on."
good,"They will work you all the time if you let them. They don't about your private life. You either work when they wanted you to or they didn't give you the hours you needed to survive. Some managers cared more about picking on employees than helping them succeed. Other managers pushed you to your limit because they believed you could excel. Pay was higher than anyone else in town but lower than industry standards. As long as you did not care about an outside life, then they loved you. You got your hours and when they do their bi-annual terminating spree, you were safe."
good,"There are some good  and some bad...not much job security in recent years and poor communication, high turnover."
good,Liked the people I worked with management wasn’t on top of things hard to get the job done with them micromanaging. Not a good experience but did work there for 5 years.
good,"Being a single parent, Walmart was not necessarily the ideal place to work.  Trying to get scheduled time off for school and/or doctor's appointments was like pulling teeth, and Heaven forbid you had a sick kid.  My immediate supervisor was awesome, however, store policies made it difficult to want to continue working there"
good,Poor pharmacy management. Irate customers. The pay was okay but not enough for the amount of stress and rudeness that one had to put up with. The most enjoyable part of the day was getting to leave.
good,i really enjoyed working here but working over night made it hard to voice any worries or questions we had. very rare to have the same manager longer than 3 months which made getting comfortable with work hard.
good,This is a productive work place. Like any other job it is what you make of it. You will stay busy while on the clock and you get all of your breaks just about on time.
good,"I love Wal-Mart's ideas but they are not staffed well enough with the right associates to keep up with their expectations,  lack of tools  needed for the staff to maintain their responsibilities as mc-40, printers. Department managers are always being pulled to work in other departments and then held accountable for falling behind in their individual areas of responsibility."
good,Boss was good but the workers weren't. Couldn't work overnights anymore and the guy workers were bad. They tried putting me on another shift but the pay I couldn't live off.
good,"This can be the worst job you've ever had, if the management team sucks. Wal-Mart really can be a great place but majority of the time, it's the worst because managment sucks. They allow the wrong to be put into positions they know nothing about. For example, look at our President!"
good,"I did learn a lot working at Walmart, and I worked with wonderful buyers and associates, but the past few years you always had to worry about being aught up in the next layoff.  That's what happened to me."
good,"great first time job but not the case for long term or advancement"
good,This company doesn’t understand the lower associates at all. Once the higher ups do then things will change. Mostly it’s just the store I work at but I’m confident enough to know mines isn’t the only one with a poor management issue
good,"At the i was rhere the management was poor, you can,t have enough tools to work with. And people  all off frequently because they normaly don,t care about the company."
good,"I have worked for Walmart for almost 5 years, 3 years over night stocking the dairy. When the Dairy Department Managers position came open I applied. I was never Interviewed and it was given to another associate who had worked for the company for only 3 months. I transferred to another store and after working in my department for a year, once again I applied for the departments managers position and was you guessed it never interviewed and was given to a newer employee. when I inquired about it I was told that I did my job so well I couldn't be moved....."
good,Management only care about themselves.  Only resolves issues if it affects them also.  Allow customers to disrespect the staff with racial comments and false statements to get items at a lower price.  Employees are always under staffed and overworked.
good,This job is a very high paced job. Answering phone calls and transferring calls to correct department. The management changed too much. There was never enough people to work.
good,"I like working for Walmart, it is  a place to grow.  You have many chances to move up within the company.  They strive to  Walmart a place for all peoples."
good,Pushed you to work hard to get everything put up. Stressful place to work at. Got paid little to none for the work you did. Also had to assist customers while doing your job.
good,"Stock shelves, order merchandise, and set displays.  Assisted customers with item selections or locating merchandise.  Inventory control by maintaining correct stock levels following corporate plan-o-grams."
good,they dont allow for overtime if you work over your schedule shift they will make you cut hours from another day. they leave departments short staffed which makes it harder on the employees to help the customers
good,Great place. Meet lots of pets and people. Many other opproitunities to move around. Learn a lot from people you work with and those that just shop. The plus of knowing prices and good deales before shoppers.
good,Management does not work as a team and has no communication between themselves and the workers. District Managers do not care about the workers just the positive numbers for the store overall.
good,"I worked there for years; frankly, the associates were - for the most part - good, hard-working people.  The managers needed more spine, however.  Oftentimes, management would not back up the sales floor people."
good,"Me gusta el ambiente de compañerismo, pero hay muchas envidias.  "
good,Walmart is a great place to work if you  are working  with a good assistant manager. The one I had was a very lazy employee.Advancement was who liked who! If your not liked then their is no advancement. If your lucky you will not get an office manager that tells your personal business.
good,"Average to poor retail environment. Days varied, long shifts as a manager, stores tend to be understaffed, although this is different depending on the visibility of the store."
good,"I like the people that I work with. However, I need different hours and you can't change your hours for 90 days to 6 months. Some of the work is harder then others."
good,Au sein de Walmart vous pouvez y apprendre pas mal de chose. C'est une tres bonne premiere experience
good,Good environment safety first open to any suggestions. you never know what the next opportunity will be via phone/email. fixing the opportunity i a time manner and hearing the managers say job well done was satisfying.
good,"I did enjoy my job, interacting with customers. I did not care for management. There was A LOT of favoritism, that is probably expected anywhere you work, especially in retail."
good,A typical day at wal-mart is very nerve racking and a very quick pace. There are often times that you may not only work in your department because it gets very busy on the front end and they often need associates help.
good,"i was hired as part of a team, but a couple weeks in i was only one out of 3 to stay. they expected me to clean up the entire walmart when its more then a one person job and still pay me like one person"
good,night shift sucked. The managers sucked. The coworkers were okay for the most part. The customers sucked. I moved to mod team and got a set schedule tho so that was cool.
good,"the job is okay, its just management being unreasonable and the customers that make this job almost not worth it. i will admit that it is better than fast food."
good,"Policy changed at the drop of a hat and they would reprimand people retroactively, going back up to 6 months for new policies. Typical work day was fast-paced and leadership was very rarely present. When they were around it was mostly to be in a meeting and still unavailable. They catered to the lowest common denominator and ignored the highly trained people.I'd seen the same people making the same mistakes for over a year and still have their job. Others who where more competent were fired for very random and innocuous reasons. The management ruled by fear. Fear of losing ones job. This is not how I would expect the world's largest retailer to operate, but it is. At least from what I saw on a daily basis."
good,Ordering and purchasing supplies. Taking inventory and restocking products. Fulfilling customer orders and stocking showcase. Communicating with various kinds of people and personalities. Working well alone or as part of a team.
good,"Bad management they need to practice what they preach.They company itself is ok but take away these managers I believe Walmart will have more successful people. They want you to shop as an employee bring the money back to our home store get treated poorly as a employee and customer!!! Managers shows to much favoritism.. This company have a lot of perks.. they need to take the bad seeds out. Mangers show favoritism to other managers. Management doesn't speak to the employees when approaching or approached, no eye contact just rude. Management doesn't respect the employees they don't know how to talk to the other person. They always want drama. New store but the majority of the employees are rude."
good,Working at Walmart consisted of handling cash and dealing with everyday customer's. I enjoyed working with my fellow employees and co-workers as well as management.
good,I had a fair experience working at Walmart. I would not recommend my friends to work here due to lack of hours and mismanagement. There was not good enough scope to grow in Walmart.
good,"Management needs better customer service and needs work on how to talk or relay messages to fellow associates. It would be nice to be able to receive better bonuses and better, fair pay raises."
good,Worse team environment I've ever encountered. There was not a spirit of teamwork among the lot of them. They literally let me know they were not willing to train me.
good,"A typical day at work was"
good,"The process of taking decision is very slow. Can be more stable if employee feel happy."
good,"Managers didn't pay much attention to employees with problems.  Manager talked ugly to employees in front of customers.  Managers, always pointed out what an employee did wrong but no props for something done right. Managers showed favoritism to certain people."
good,"it wasn't all that great the management and CSMs played favorites big time, if you weren't one of the favored ones you got shafted at every opportunity and got blamed for anything that went wrong and chewed out for every little thing"
good,Very hard to talk to anyone and then when you do they do not communicate with the proper ppl.  Definitely need to change that policy. The manager is always never available and when messages are left they are not addressed.
good,"Empresa de distribucion en crecimiento. Las desiciones de estrategias en los diferentes canales siempre eran tomadas por el presidente y propietario de la compañia, dejando fuera la opinion de los gerentes que teniamos mejor informacion del mercado y canal"
good,I wouldn't recommend it as a permanent job but part time work would go great with atmosphere. The associates are friendly and considerate of certain situations and its fun to be there during the black Friday sale. Overall I would say Wal-Mart is better off being a seasonal job but its a ok place to work.
good,"Walmart was really great when starting out, We had a lot of employees and everybody got along. I love all my co-workers but management on the other hand is the reason my experience was bad. After working there for 6 months I was blamed when something went wrong on managements time, not just me but other employees too. After loosing 6 Technicians, 3 Service writers & 3 managers in the shop. I decided to start looking for another job. Its a real good place to work because all the co-workers get along and enjoy there self's but it seemed to me they would jump the gun and fire employees fast or push them to the point they would want to find a different job. Its sad but highly recommend for college students looking to gain some great experience while it lasts. best of luck to you all and hope this helps you out."
good,"A typical day would include assigning my associates duties, such as, unloaded trucks, socking specific isles, binning freight, moving merchandise to and from the floor, and most importantly, teaching quality customer service.  I learned that teamwork and communication is vital to success in the workplace and to be able to develop associates."
good,Good it was an okay experience but the manager was disrespectful to me and non understanding I didn't understand why the hours were pretty good as well and so were the co workers
good,I do not wish to write a review of this company. I don't really see the point in doing so. Walmart is a place for a person to get a job to keep the lights on.
good,if you want to change position you have to wait 6 months minimum even if your allergic to the aisle your in. the schedule is messed up. your training is really short.
good,I enjoy the challenges that walmart hand me daily.  I enjoy teaching and training associates and Asms . I enjoy seeing the succession plans lead our teams.
good,a typical day at work will be dealing with multi culture customers. I learned a lot from people each and every one have something you can pick. Manage your life in a good manners on daily basic. Keep focus on your job and three is noting such kind of hard ship
good,had to do the work that morning shift didn't do and never got recognition for all the work i would do very poorly management they would show up like 3 hours later after you would call them for help
good,Make the mark your team sets or you will be spoken to the 1st time 2nd time you get a written warning 3rd time you get written up 4th time you get fired keep quiet dont have an opion or voice it
good,"My responsibilities include 10 stores with a total volume of 700 mil and an approximate associate population of 2500.  Two of my current stores are Complex with a highly diverse population.  Previously, I was the MHRM for Mkt 179, Northern ME.  I have been successful as a Retail Executive Director of Human Resources, Employee/Labor Relations with 30+ years of outstanding accomplishments. Multi-location/Multi-state and International experience with The Golub Corporation,  The Holstein Association, C&S Wholesale Distributors, Federated Department Stores and The Zale Corporation."
good,"In my opinion a  typical  day at work  starts out calm and then goes down hill after that  the store does not train its employees but expect them to know what to do on the spot.  two many managers in one store also not knowing what they should do the company has no interest in what its employees has to say because they know everything again in my opinion as an associate we have more interaction with the customers on a day to day basis, and therefore, knows what the customer wants"
good,I think this would be a great position for a teenager starting their first job. As an older adult their isn't that much room for advancement . pay Also wouldn't be enough for someone with  children or a lot of expenses.
good,"Benefits only for full time, but management was the only full time positions. Inconsistent hours. No personal time. Great for students looking for part time work."
good,"It is an ok job.  It depends on what day it is if I'm on the register or if I'm stocking shelves.   The day I am stocking shelves, I still go and relieve the cashier for her breaks and lunch.  But, I like the people I work with on night shift.  The bosses are usually easy to get along with.  et b"
good,"Overall my good days out weighed the bad ones. I liked the fact that we got a bonus every 3 months. The management could really use some help tho, they really don't know how to talk to their associates."
good,"summer job"
good,"it was a ok job could be better if management was better some don't care how they talk to the associates ,as  long as it not them then its ok ,over I like working at -wal mart"
good,"They don't set you the same time and days to work. They expect you to be able to work all shifts and every weekend. If you get sick, well your tuff out of luck. If you get a doctor request off, emergencies with family or others not involving the job, be prepared to get fired.  If you have a family, school or another job I wouldnt recommend it."
good,"Good benefits, but terrible places to work. Not enough hours. Messy coworkers and mangement. everything else was good only thing bad about the job was hours and can get fired over anything"
good,E uma empresa tranquila pra trabalha porem nao fornece muitos beneficios para os funcionarios
good,This was a good starting job for me.  I do not feel that the management was good at the store I was in.  The store was severly understaffed.  There were many shifts I was the only person in my department for the entire shift.
good,"The management was very much a click. If you were friends with the office manager, you got to see her quickly. If not, you were seen when she got to you."
good,"Working at Walmart has good and bad things that happen. It's nice when we get bonuses, and barbeques. However, sometimes there is favoritism because of diversity"
good,"Pay was fair and hours were flexible until recently, not guaranteed full time hours and managers consistently ask for associates to go outside of job requirement to complete other tasks."
good,Good entry level job. Known for being short staffed and breaking labor laws. Not flexible on scheduling. Long wait times for advancement.Evaluation for raise unfair.
good,"I would work hard to get done what I could and management seemed happy to just let you keep working like a dog and never asked if you needed help or didn't care if you were doing 4 or 5 peoples job on top of your own.  Maybe the non-experienced managers just didn't know what it took to get the job done. That on top of not getting on people to get to work but ask more and more from the people that did work because it was easier than making lazy people not lazy, very frustrating."
good,"Working at walmart started off ok, but then they have decided to get rid of the over night crew and take away money.  Some of the co workers are really good."
good,Typical day at work consisted of starting work and getting safety equipment on and preparing work station for busy day of cleaning front of store and organizing items.
good,"Ten to twelve hour shifts 3 or 4 days a week, Great pay and benefits, very very poor management and human resources departments. Mandatory overtime very last minute as far out as two days in advance."
good,"Teamwork between associates and the management team in this kind of job is important to finish the everyday task.  Communication is very necessary to avoid misunderstanding in performing everyone's job. Provision of the necessary personal protective equipment to ensure the safety of the employees in performing their respective jobs and with the customers as well. The hardest part of the job is dealing with different kinds of customers especially the rude ones, you have to be very patient to cope with them. A tap on the shoulder or a simple thank you is enough after doing a job well, makes me boost my moral and inspires me more to do my job above and beyond."
good,My experience at Wal-Mart was okay being that I was still a senior in High School at the time and was trying to make extra money for all the activities
good,"I did not work there long enough. Seasonal only but very unorganized. Also noticed that outside from employees that work there, outsiders don't get permanent unless you know someone there or a relative"
good,"A good work place , but not enough opportunities for advancement, and management is bad. Warehouse is small, and overcrowded. It feels more like prison then an actual work place"
good,"This place sucks the life out of you. Its fine if you just want to be a cashier or sales associate but if you want to advance at all you better believe your thoughts on working for this company will change. I have seen so many amazing people loose their ""spark"" pardon the pun. This job defiantly isn't for the faint hearted."
good,Walmart is a good place to work. Management treats its employees fairly and try's to work with them as much as possible. Unfortunately there is not many hours available and the pay starts out low for the stress you have to deal with.
good,I made alot of friends there. The bosses were ok and I may want to try it again. I enjoyed the fast pace and it was a learning experience for me. To figure out what I wanted to do.
good,a typical work day i would come in at 9am go to the back room to get a cart and stock the food once thats done ill go take a 15 min break and resume with what i was doing before i left
good,Walmart as a company need s to understand their workers better. As a single mom of two I was fired because I called off to much. Well understanding that I have to take care of my kids when they are sick is your first priority. The company needs to get better about the way they treat their staff!
good,"walmart as a whole is a good company however the values it was founded on die when mr sam did. If you are passionate about what you do, or care too much, you wont last. stores wan yes men, if you have ideas or any individuality, this is not the company for you."
good,Can be very stressful especially when the store gets a lot of people but only has a handful of associates scheduled for the day. On the other hand can be fun and simple when everyone is working together to accomplish what needs to be done.
good,"It's a job but nothing is consistent. Job knowledge is key. It doesn't matter what your job title is or what department you work in, in order to be successful you should learn the entire floor."
good,"Very micro managed, Good old boys club mentality. No opportunity"
good,"A typical workday is well structured. I learned about cleaning of a large department store, how this company sets its shelves, and the operation of a deli. Most members of management are great however there are a few that should not be in their position. Workplace culture is like that of a family and it was a great place to work. The hardest part of the job being away from my children. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers. I made a lot of good friends there"
good,"Typical day starts out at 7 am cleaning in and around registers stocking suppies as needed   my CSM'S are good about getting me supplies needed my first two hours are assisting customer needs as I clean and restock beggs reciet tapes  emty trash  maintance on registers that are compromised  that is also the hardest part of the job because cutomers still need assistance at the same time I'm trying to get the registers backup and running , very fast pace and unappreciated position I'm a very patient person but even that has its limits"
good,As an Overnight stocker we were given several carts to put away before morning as well as picks. I was told by a manager that they would rather I got more stocked in Pharmacy department then rotate the product per company policy. If you finished 2 carts the night before they expected more the next night. The managers never seemed happy with the amount of work done.
good,"Basically a great place to work, offering opportunities to many employees that other employers would pass over. Nice way to meet people. Job is very face-paced and physically demanding."
good,"Your day starts when you clock in, and head to work. Due to the constant shortage of personnel you have to be in on time or the whole crew will suffer."
good,"I dislike the hours and how the whole system that Walmart have when it comes running a super store.  It is very unorganized and poor communications. From management to associates, it seems no one knows whats going on when it gets busy."
good,This job is stressful because of the management that are in charge of you. Also customers come in there mad and rude just to ruin your day. Employees slack off and don't do their work.
good,"It's what you'd expect.  The corporate structure allows for basic benefits and pay, and the job itself isn't terrible, especially if one likes dealing with customers. However it's managed -extremely poorly on a department and individual store level. Almost comically bad."
good,Walmart is a great place to work if you get into the right department. Fast paced environment which makes the day fly by. My co-workers were great people to work with. It is difficult to grow with the company though and I found that disappointing. Management was very supportive and always gave positive feedback. I
good,"This place provides great opportunities for advancement. The lack of decent management is horrific to say the least. Because of their corporate generated policy that must be followed to a T, a lot of small local problems are left unresolved, and cause a very high turnover rate. they do not value their employees. they rely on a high turnover rate."
good,"The hours are poor, they treat the cart associates with lack of care. They expect you to continue to work under unbearable situation. Sometimes you are by yourself due to the lack of scheduling."
good,"- doing schedules, interviewing, training associates, helping out in Electronics, and the Photo Lab when super busy."
good,"nothing worth while. i have some animosity towards walmart and its management from personal experience. i'd reccomend it as a first job, a stepping stone"
good,Production driven and good scheduling for families and students. The most difficult thing about this warehouse job is avoiding write ups week by week.
good,"I did not enjoy working at Wal-Mart. They schedule you for extremely long hours, such as from 2pm until 11pm and one hour long break. You are forced to stand up throughout your shift on cheap, uncomfortable mats. There is little to no communication with management. They do not tolerate calling out or being late to work regardless of your reason. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and your co-workers. You will meet new people every day and"
good,"Very rigid work environment with minimal room for advancement without adhering to corporate nonsense, very stressful, but pays the bills for now and benefits."
good,Pay is little and working hard means nothing. If u can sweet talk it gets you promoted. You are expected to help every person who ask but gets in trouble if you finish your job.
good,"friendly atmosphere friendly customers "
good,They are not good to their employees. If you want advancement this is not the company for it. Management is is poor at best. They are very hands off and rude.
good,"There were times that there was a lot going on, trucks filled with more product than we knew where to store, or things that needed to be put away quickly."
good,"Most days at Wal-Mart working as a cashier, you would usually get very nice customers but can be stressful because they usually buy a lot of items and can take a very long time. The longest transaction that I had to do nearly took one hour. I learned a lot of things about being a cashier and cart attendant but the management was very poor and bad because the managers couldn't control the staff and scheduling. The hardest part of being a cashier is dealing with impatient and harsh customers but the most enjoyable part is seeing the customers feeling satisfied and having a happy smile on their face. The hardest part of being a cart attendant is the weather and the most enjoyable part is the amount of free time you have outside and how quickly the time goes as you are working."
good,A typical day at work was pretty busy. I didn't really learned anything useful within my working career. the management I work underneath was entry level associates. the hardest part of my job was working in the elements and the most enjoyable part of my job was assisting the customers.
good,"Typically the community within walmart was mixed, management seemed to either micromanage or be so standoffish that supervisors had to take over as the management rolls. They were fairly flexible with work life balance but it depended on your other workers. The hardest part of the job was filling in for positions you were never trained on, this happened quite often. The best part was working with a positive group of close knit coworkers."
good,"I was a cashier so typical work day included standing at my register and checking customers out for hours until my first break. Sometimes (most of the time) I would get my break later than it was supposed to be. I had to know how to handle angry and irate customers. This job just depends on the type of person you are honestly. So if you're a people person and have a lot of patience go for it! IF NOT, then don't cause I guarantee you will be miserable."
good,"I worked in the distribution center for nine months. The pay was not bad. Though, I believe that their quota number are a little high though. Also, there are people there that will never make the numbers that are required but somehow will never get written up for it or even warned about it. Though, if you generally make numbers and have bad days then you will get written up."
good,"A typical day at work was at a fast paced and running around. I learned how to maintain a smile on my face and worked as fast as possible. Management would listen but most of the time poor problem solving. Regardless of the environment and the stress, I always took care of my end and tried my hardest to deliver my 100%. I really was able to find a solution to problems that came up at time. The most enjoyable part of my job was team work and my co-workers."
good,There was a lot of stuf that was supposed to be done on the over night cleaner spot for the hole crew not just me like sweeping and scrubbing the floor and buffing the floor and sometimes stripping wax and putting new wax down all had to be done by 6am no exception and while that was the every night there was always something extra like helping with unloading trucks and stocking shelves and the whole time the cleaning crew was short staffed and stressing to get the daily tasks done with much needed people pulled away to do other stuff not related to cleaning
good,I didn't like that when I became pregnant at  Walmart they had no sympathy for me I had to pick up 24 packs of water and 48 packs of beer they didn't care if I was to lose my baby or not they said oh well just deal with it. And also they could not wait for me to get approved for my insurance so I could get a doctors note which resulted in me leaving the job.
good,"If you're just looking for something to pay a few bills, but not anything fulfilling, that's Wal-Mart. It's a place where the manager's don't even acknowledge you unless they want something and only a fraction of the associates do their actual jobs."
good,"Walmart associates have the unique opportunity to affect millions of people every day. While the company is massive, each department is very lean and many groups function as startups trying to secure funding from corporate leadership to execute competing ideas. With the recent layoffs, teams have become increasingly lean - causing the environment to become even more competitive."
good,Es una muy buena empresa solo que mal dirigida en la gerencia hay de todo desde unos muy buenos que te enseñan hasta otros que solo cuando hay visita o algo así la dirección debería de mirar a como administran las tiendas por que el trato de los distritales hacia arriba es totalmente como el Sr Sam Walton q.p.d predicaba pero de las gerencias muchas veces no es así
good,"I liked working there, but I 5he position I have feels like there's no room for advancement, and no chance to get full time hours or benifets. I would like better benifets."
good,"The work of a support manager is about accuracy and keeping the other associates doing what they supposed to do, you don't get any support from upper management.  And when you come up with a idea they take it from you and they make it there own and take all the credit."
good,"If you can work they like you and will keep you, but they let people get away with way to much for a professional work environment."
good,"Some big positions needed to be real at their position. Raised is poor. No raise for the new hiring. When passing the 90 days, no raise due to pathways needed to be done. Cant to do pathways managers incharge didnt allow time for these even though there are enough people on floor working. Always ignored lunch and break time when busy. Lunch would be taken at one hour after time supposed to be"
good,"merchandiser, stocker at night, became monotonous.learned"
good,Overall I love the job just didn't understand the point system but I would recommend anyone to work for Wal-Mart the world need more cashiers..... Go for it
good,"Working in the remodeling crew was good, I gained good experience on how to work as a group as well as on my own. The hours for us were consistant and work was always busy."
good,"Co-workers are great, management is better on some days than others. Wish they would up the pay for what their associates do. Certain departments need more associates, more cashiers needed"
good,"Working at Walmart was a fun place to interact with customers and fellow associates. You have a set schedule. However, the conflict between managers never gave you a clear set of expectations. I felt pulled in several different directions between the managers."
good,"Overall, Walmart is not a terrible place to work at if you know the right people. If you're on good terms with management and they like you and your job performance, you have the opportunity to move up and advance in the company. I'd say the hardest part of being a cashier is the customers you deal with on a daily basis, but the good ones are what make it worth it. I loved my regulars that I knew by name and had conversations with. The benefits offered are good as well."
good,"Working overnights at Walmart as a stocker is not too bad, as long as that is the type of job you are looking for. Stocking shelves, and helping customers, but there is a lot of drama between employees and management, and management never knew what they were doing."
good,Manager did not hold promises. I didn't like the hours. I requested some important days off and were denied.The job just didn't fit what I was looking for.
good,"When I worked there it was a difficult transition to their store, but after a while, I found it a very interseting place to use my skills at customer service and employee/employer relations. Challenging, and fun."
good,Crew Members were excellent to work with. Although salaried management chose to use favoritism and would talk down to hourly associates. A decent number of salaried managers would actively  be on their cell phone handling personal while on the job.
good,"Poor associate involvement from management."
good,"it's a fast paced, stressful work environment. a lot of micromanaging. Its a job and they do hire people of all diversities and they do not discriminate when hiring. Hours work are unpredictable. your paycheck is unpredictable even if you are available to work. You can make X dollars one week and Y dollars the next. but one good thing I can say and like is the fact they give almost anyone a chance for employment."
good,They give considerable good pay to start out with compared to most common jobs. However the management there is not the best at all. Did not consider my availability and treated me very badly thus I quit Walmart.
good,"They promote the morons, and managers try and keep the best employees from getting promoted. They tend to bend over backwards for those associates. The managers are morons. The new system is designed to eliminate jobs and more of them over time. my first shift job went to an early shift, 4am-1pm. They managed to not pay you 3rd shift pay bonus either."
good,A great place to work if they become more organized and have better management that actually protect and guide their employees instead let their employees be self taught.
good,"This place is trash. Very low pay, bad attendance policy and the discount isn't worth it. You would think that working here you would get at least 25 percent off but nope. Only 10"
good,Contract work. Full time employees like the culture. Hard to get into as a permanent employee. Typical day is hectic with a lot of meetings. Need to bring jobs back on shore instead of off shore.
good,"Working at Walmart was expectable as a temporary job. Management was average and a was valued. Unfortunately there was very little opportunity for advancement. The hours worked was also not well managed. The rate of pay for the level of work was not acceptable, either."
good,"Not a bad job, management wasn't very caring and didn't seem to care to help anyone with any problems. Work wasn't too bad and the co workers were amazing."
good,I probably would never go back to work for the company again staff was very unprofessional and very messy just a environment i dont see my self working in
good,"If you like being patronized this may just be the job for you. Honestly the company is a great one to work for, advancing is very possible, but the managers have to be there to facilitate everything and often times, some of the managers arent very interested in makin sure that the associates under them are able to advance in  timely manner."
good,"It's a great job just have to look over the management sometimes, they act like their life's  is more important then the associates when it should be all equal"
good,The workplace was a fast pace environment.  The hardest part was not being able to advance as it was promised to me and dealing with broken promises. My most enjoyable part was having a job and making new friendships with my fellow employees.
good,I have summed it all up within the pros & cons. Good luck working within this company. I am not a very wordy person. Enjoy your time within this company. It may just work out for you!
good,I worked at Wal-Mart for two years and I really liked the hours and the people I worked with became my second family. Because of this I did very much so enjoy my job. Because I did meet and ins it wasn't great but because of those two factors I was able to do it for that long. The only thing that I didn't like or the management. Me and one of the supervisors constantly clashed and she was on my back very frequently it made it very difficult to work some days.
good,"Pay was okay at the time, Management was a little bit bad... i actually mean very bad. The zone managers and CSM played favorites even pulled team members out to have hour long non work related conversations. At the time we had to find someone who could cover breaks on our own without help. However because of this i was able to learn how to cover other departments very quickly."
good,"When I first started working at Walmart it was a fun job. It was easy and relax. I work night shift. Stocking. I was assign to the Clothing dept. and I have no help. They expect me to finish stocking 5 to 10 pallet of clothing by the end of my shift. it was about 6 ft high with 20 boxes of clothes, jeweler and shoes on each pallet. It was not only me. If they feel your dept wasn't ""important"" they kind of just ignore you. It was really stressful on my end because if you didn't finish you get a write up. Thank fully I always finish my job assignment. Management was good,"
good,Walmart pays well and I enjoyed working with and getting to meet new people. Management does not really care about the individual needs of their employees and only tries to help their associates if they threaten to call corporate. I loved working in my area but I hated when management put me in areas that I had little to no experience in and failed to train me in those areas.
good,You'll stay busy here. they tend to run a skeleton crew so every day can be a challenge.  I learned a lot here about time management and productivity.  This is a hard place to work for but it shaped my standards and expectations as an employee.
good,Some days if can hard I feel we need to get paid more for what we do there .Bills  are need to get paid at home and walmart is just not doing it employers who work there.
good,"Bono de resultados excelente te dan hasta 90 dias de salario si la tienda sale con buenos resultados en agosto y en el mes de marzo te pagan el bono, buen aguinaldo de 30 dias, lastima que el salario sea un poco bajo, pero si haces antiguedad te ira bien y debes de aprender de todo para que te hagan gerente, es buena empresa si quieres hacer carrera ahi mismo porque ellos te capacitan para todo pero es mucho esfuerzo y sacrificio que debes hacer por la empresa, porque a pesar de que ellos tienen un programa de vida familiar les hace falta mucho para mejorarlo."
good,"I learned a lot at Walmart, how to manage associates and thier well being, how to use warehouse equipment and management systems, how to keep associates safe in the work place and motivated them to get the job done."
good,On a typical day at work you would check over your Freight. Then you begin to go and put out the stock on the shows where it belongs. Fix any merchandise putting it back in its proper place if it's not in its proper place. I learned how to work quickly and safely. Also it's a great way to learn how to have great people skills. It teaches you how to have a great balance between work and your customers. Management is not always well-balanced nor did I find them easy to talk to all the time. But they weren't always hard to work with. Could use more synchronized communication. People from all over worked together and seem to get along very well. The hardest part of the job I would say for me would be the pace of the work because you had to get all your Freight up and then had to make sure that everything was zoned. Which means everything has to be pulled forward on the shelves and sometimes it's really hard to get everything done in multiple areas by yourself. The most enjoyable part about the job would probably be for me helping the customers and finding what they need no matter where it's at in the store.
good,Not much to say. Working at Walmart as a sales associate you're assigned to a department where if someone comes to you looking for an item you know where to point them towards but most of the time people will come asking you for something located to the other side of the store and when you need help finding the item it feels like you're the only associate in the whole store.
good,This company pays very well when you get into the managemnet program. But when you get paid well you can expect to be in the building 60 plus hours per week.
good,It was ok there was alot of cultures there it was difficult sometimes and the manament  is fair  somtimes other then helping costumers and haveing safe pratices
good,Walmart is very flexible with schedule is you're a student. The pay is ok. The employeee discount is very useful.  They offer you the option to transfer to other stores.
good,constant change in management makes things confusing and hard to get work done.  several different managers and supervisors put you on details sometimes at the same time. I did not like this aspect of the work.  Liked working with customers.
good,"I worked at the Salem, Va location."
good,"It was an okay job, but not a lot of advancement or appreciation. No one trained there. Most management didn't know how to do their job or help us. It was okay at best."
good,"Working with the public is a great life experience."
good,"Helping customers and trying to keep up with the managers demands is the biggest obstacle after that it is a very nice place to the work, kind of a family environment within departments it's very nice."
good,"Do your job and that's it"
good,"The one thing that irked me was Walmart as a company liked to boast and brag about their employee appreciation but when it came down too it, the only people i had actually showing me appreciation and MEANING it were my fellow part timers and my zone manager! All the other managers at meetings and such said it with some good amount of strain like ""yeah we are glad you guys are here but not really, im just getting paid to say it"" kind of attitude about it."
good,The customers were great. The people where I was at had know idea how to train or manage there associates the proper way. Nothing was where it should be.
good,It was a fun place to work.The pay wasn't that great but the employees I worked with were great back then.From what I've heard there's not many full time jobs left.Its been about 21 years since I have worked for Walmart.
good,"It was relaxed until some managers think you have to be constantly busy even when you are finished with all of your work, you get in trouble for downtime. If you want a family/life balance and talk to them about hours they pretty much ridicule you for it, and then cut your hours super low out of spite. They encourage advancement and then don't give it to you for whatever silly reason they can come up with and don't get onto the lazy workers only the ones who bust their butts."
good,It was a steady workplace. I was the only employee in my position so it was kind of stressful but I handled it like a champ and did my job the best way I could. The people are friendly.
good,"Job was  disolved by company was given the option for another position with the company, i chose to retire i enjoyed my position as the Invoice Associate"
good,"First we would set up cash register up,then we would zone the store,then put up stock,and clean shelves "
good,One of the perks to working at Walmart is being cross-trained for other positions. You learn a lot of skills. The hardest part of the job is meeting managements expectations without any guidance or knowledge of how to do certain tasks.
good,"Management sucks, hours are either way too much or you don't get any. Never a good balance. Cashiers forced to sell Mastercards or you get treated poorly for it (put on long tills, cashiers who sell Mastercards get put on short tills because they're easier). People you work with are generally okay people. Customers sucked."
good,I come in to work punch in maybe not sometimes theirs someone there to tell you when to clock in because Store Mgr. is cutting overtime. So when you get in the produce cooler its full all the way to the doors you can't even walk in! You have to pull pallets out just so you can see what you have otherwise this is in the morning shift! You have to breakdown the load 1st as you load carts for the sales floor almost no one has any training in produce just me and some people refuse to let you train them! Upper Management will not stand behind you when you go to coach associate therefore you are stuck with the problem and they still want to know why things are not getting done they fire the good hard workers and keep the ones who don't want to work go figure? People just show up to collect a check and want to talk on their cell phones or sometimes even tablets and upper Management  still wants to know why production numbers are not being met. When you go to coach them the store Mgr on your shift will not back you up so the problem never gets resolved it's like a catch 22 very stressful indeed!
good,"At first it's decent, they don't train you very well. They stick you with another cashier for two days then put you on your register. When you need change asap you can't get it on time. If you need help with a customer or if something went wrong and you need a CSM you can never find them when you need them the most."
good,Got my hours cut for no reason after 2 years of busting my butt and working overtime and traveling sometimes 3 hours a day. I fear that my benefits or more hours will be cut again or that I May even get let go. Many superiors are incapable at their jobs yet seem to get all the praise.
good,The good thing bout Walt-Mart was that you count always count on a check every week no matter how much they reduced your hours.  I liked it better when I worked overnight.  No management around who was around during day hours.
good,"Positive: I have learned a lot, however most things I've learned are only Walmart related and cannot be taken on to a different company. Negative: One thing that it drags down the company are its own ""too big to listen to anyone"" attitude which applies to many of the upper management who don't take the time to listen to front line employees for ideas and feedback. Very stressful job, no life/work balance, not enough pay for the amount of work and S*** you have to put up with."
good,"same routine every day, easy to get a hang of every day jobs and tasks, learnt productive strategy, friendly staff, heavy lifting, very cold, horrible managment"
good,Hard time with management would love to work there again heard a lot of manager's were moved so hopefully the power trip is over.as long as certain manager's are gone it would be a great job to have.
good,"Not having enough time with family. Wal-Mart might say they are for family, but they are not. I had to work every holiday and they would not even rotate."
good,was a good first job to have but when looking to advance make sure you are at the right walmart with a decent manager that will talk about those kind of things with you
good,"I have worked at Walmart for almost 10 years.  The work experience I have gained over the years has been incredible.  Customer Service, Flexibility, Decision Making, Effective Communication, etc."
good,It is a fast pace workday and different cultures to handle everyday. Handle different problems everyday. Management that you have to work for is not just one its a group of 5 to 6. The regular associates are very good at working together for the most part. The company does have good benefits.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work. It gives the experience of working/serving a great deal of diversity of people. The environment is decently clean, cool or warm when needed."
good,"Great beginning job. Fast pace environment, Lots of long nights, and weekends. Benefits pay are good, health coverage is shotty at best. Work/life balance is the biggest downfall to this position."
good,The store I worked at was not very understanding of me being a student. Had to negotiate my availability and even after it was set they would exceed it anyway without my approval.
good,"Good place to work overall, some management needs changing to improve customer satisfaction Associates are willing to learn and advance wish them luck"
good,It's was a good I moved up quickly but once the reopen I got let go. I felt like the managers were never around when you needed them and that made costumers upset.
good,If you are looking for a temporary job its not bad but if you want full time your most likely not to get it. They tend to hire only part timers so one should not look to them for a long term career.
good,"Pleased with the way my co workers treated me as a new employee and always felt welcome with them. The work environment itself was always uplifting and fun. However, the management team had some policies and procedures that were unfair and unjust towards employees. Also, as a full time high school student, the hours were very long. I was working full time hours on top of school."
good,"Drive sales to attain goals and metric percentages"
good,"I enjoyed my job, however management​ lacked organization. I found myself unhappy at work due to stress and drama within the department, of which management often refused to address our concerns. They often only stepped in when we were overwelmed to the point of breaking down on the job. I found work related stress and problems would affect my home life and on several occasions caused  turmoil in my relationship and with family. I missed several events and found that management was reluctant to work with me on the rare occasion I would request off. Often times one employee would be stretch though out the department and even sometimes into deli to cover open positions when we were short staffed which was fine, but it would last several months. When I started I was told we were supposed to have 12 associates in bakery alone, within 6 months it was 8 and by the time I left we were told we could have no more than 6. Which is the bare minimum to cover every position. At one point there were only 4 employees​ in bakery: a baker, two decorators, and our manager. It was a fun work environment with alot of creative freedom, but only when we all were getting along."
good,An Associate stated that i had pushed them and after a full investigation there was no video or any evdiance. they still wrote me up fpr spmeting i didn't do.
good,"If your work full time, years, you may can get full benefits"
good,It was an ok job I was young and looking for work. It was good pay for a teenager but they were pretty strict about too many things especially promotions I just could not see me making it a career.
good,"First thing first.  Walmart does not care about you.  Management does not care about you.  The average person last about 3 months.  I've seen so many people come and go. One co-worker was rolled out on a stretcher, and they still gave her a point for missing work. Another one was fired from defending herself from an attacker. You will never get full time. You will work full time for part time benefits. Again Walmart does not care about you.  You are just there to make them money. I hate working for Walmart, but I loved the people I worked with; so that made it better."
good,"The dynamics and set up for part-time employees are less than favorable for the workers. No pay raise is offered for 90 days and that's only at the completion of the computer training, no form of benefits for one year and the starting pay rate is low for certain areas of the store. Unless you're interested in a management job there are no other options to become full-time."
good,Many customers come in and out of the store. It is a very hectic sometimes and can be a little overwhelming but its a good job and nothing bad happens.
good,"If you need to work to take care of yourself and your family (make an honest living) then, yes, please take a job at Walmart.  Otherwise you need to be very social and overlywilling to please!"
good,each day you may have eough people to help with work then other you may not. The pharmacy makes the most money but still get hours cut. They donot care about how you feel or if you can do your job with 3 people or 6 people like.
good,"The biggest thing when working for this company is to be extremely patient. They have all the necessary tools to succeed if you are patient with the management. Sometimes the management styles do not make sense and you will run into people where it doesn't make sense why they are in a position of power. Just be patient and since Walmart crushes any idea of unions, you have to be diligent and protect yourself by doing your job correctly and follow all protocols that are displayed even if they do not make sense."
good,If you want to work hard and not get the compensation you deserve then this is the job for you. With such a high employee turn around rate its hard to get to know your co-workers. All in all what can you say. It's Walmart.
good,You can always count on them to hire you and give you that chance that no other company would. I learned allot there. The hardest part of the job by far was running the register. Management was very helpful and co-workers were the best.
good,"Walmart as a whole is a great place to work. The management teams  need work. The work is overwhelming at time and there is plenty of it, but your rarely approved for overtime. The pride in your work and self goals will get you through the rough days."
good,12 hours a day for 3 days a week. Varifying freight and shipping labels to ensure that the stores are stocked. More so a seasonal job than a full time job
good,"Management is poorly chosen."
good,"I like that the job is fast paced and always busy. I don't like the fact that we don't get full time unless u have seniority, and the work environment is good."
good,"Cashiering responsibilities "
good,"The pay is standard for the industry but the expectations are pretty extreme. If you want to have a life outside of work, it will be difficult. You are scheduled to work 52 hours minimum but usually work 60+ hours a week. Senior management is a hit or miss on willingness to teach and train. Most of the time you are left to learn it or figure it out on your own. It is a very fast paced environment and the expectations are very high. It's not a bad job as long as you don't want or plan on doing anything outside of work."
good,the actual job I did enjoy. I just stocked shelves for the most part. I felt that the management was a little sloppy only because there were a lot of aggressive employees who weren't being dealt with properly because of their seniority.
good,"Unload and unpack deliveries of merchandise, organizing merchandise in the stockroom and stocking shelves on the sales floor. Put price tags on store merchandise. Conduct an inventory of existing stock. Keep the shelves stocked at the store. Remodel shelves and areas of store."
good,"No room for advancement, my new manager has less experience than i do, i work very hard, I really enjoy working with the public, and helping people out"
good,"The work was fine, but the people in charge did not know what they were doing.  They couldn't keep the rules straight if their lives depended on it.  Pretty much the only thing positive I took away was the co-workers I became friends with and the nice consistent work."
good,I loved being a Customer Service Manager and I loved what I did. But some managers should never be managers if they don't know how to be managers. I feel that Wal-Mart as a company should send their management in training to a course of people skills cause obviously some don't have any
good,"Freight, freight, and more freight. Dealing with the public whether they are in a please mood or not. Working with some Managers that don't have a clue what they're doing. Under staffed."
good,"They were very unorganized and never kept up with the rotations. Sometimes I would get my break or lunch on time, sometimes they didn't. They refused to adjust my schedule to my school schedule so I ultimately had to leave them."
good,"I worked overnight there for 6 years, and wish I had been able to stay longer. I found most managers to be respectful and competent, and my co workers were friendly and pleasant. Company benefits were available, and were mostly decent. Being such a large company, there are a lot of rules and strict policies, and in time I came to understand most of them. Management can be very helpful and supportive, however, and I mostly miss that about the place."
good,Call center collections great service deliver and sort incoming outgoing mail five milk line phones incoming and outgoing call help clients account great hours
good,"Customers/suspects and staff/management are just as wrong. Countless investigations, hostile and emotional suspects. Difficult to balance between life and work."
good,"it pays the bills, make friends."
good,I have learned how to effectively handle customers on a daily basis. The ability to learn fast. Hours were consistent with my family life . Do have room for advancement
good,"The Wal-mart company has changed tremendously over the years and not for the better. Associates get less hours, less benefits, and less respect. The only ones who ""save money; live better"" are the ones who sit behind the desks and make demands."
good,"I enjoyed the customers that came into the store. Management was critical at times and much of the time absent.  The hardest part of the job was the management communication. The culture, at times, was tense as there were often petty arguments with employees."
good,the company is a good place to work if you don't mind geting paid every 2 weeks and only gettin like 30 to 35 hours each week but having no time for your family or your self. the hours are bad because you can work like 4pm till midnitgh and than have to be back in at 5 am and when you live like 30 mins away that is hard work and they really do not care at all.
good,My first job. Started as unloader was easy i liked to go beyond what they wanted. Got promoted fairly quickly and saw differences in how the new people did my old job.
good,Working at Wal-Mart was very stressful and cut throat. The work environment was hostile. Women were treated unfairly. The hardest part of the job was all of the heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job was the Holidays.
good,Very competitive and fast paced environment that is a customer service orieted. Not very understanding of medical conditions or medications being taken.
good,Some days are good some are bad. never really have consistency as far as what needs to happen. Management changes policies to fit what they do not want to do. Management does not know how to schedule associates correctly which makes my job hard to get done.
good,"Look Walmart isn't the best. It's not terrible, but the management purposefully does not inform you of all the job's rights/responsibilities, or if it's full-time or not, or anything else that would possibly benefit you but not them. The job itself is great, the people are friendly, it's just the company is whack."
good,Management does not care about the job and any problems that they have are immediately thrown to the lowest level. This creates a frustrating environment for both employee and management.
good,Overall this job was stressful when needing support from management there was none. I understand being in management could be stressful but the most important part of this company is our customers. With front end customer service managers not having help from upper management it made this job extremely stressful!
good,"My typical day of work was to see what wasn't being done, and get it done. I learned pretty much everything in that department. Things such as food safety, food preparation procedures, and providing customer service. The management wasn't too great, either not being strict enough and I had my fair share of unfair treatment. The hardest part of the job was the stress. Many deadlines to meet but there was always one or two people making things harder for everyone. What I loved about the job the most was finding ways to be even faster and more efficient at tasks than other people."
good,"A very fast paced environment that keeps you on your toes all day and every day. Plenty of opportunities for advancement. Responsible for many key position in the day to day running of the store. Walmart has given me the opportunity to learn several valuable skills, that I can use in many other fields besides retail."
good,"even though its the largest retail provider in the country, i say its time for a huge change. Ive had my fill of walmart, i can barely shop there now after the treatment."
good,"I enjoy team work. This helps production and eliminate stress among employees and managers. I work great alone, but team work helps meet goals and demands sooner when done safely and accordingly to the rules."
good,"the pace of this job was ridiculous. Non stop action, You will sweat from the time you walk in the door till the time you leave. Definitely a job for the younger generation, if they like hard labor."
good,I enjoyed working there but managers are lazy and often times don't know how to perform the job that there having you do. Hard to respect managers that play on there phones and accomplish nothing while they make 60k a year.
good,The company was okay to work for. It was the management at the store I worked for who I had issues with. They didn't know how to talk to people and showed favoritism alot
good,"As a salaried member of management, there isn't a work / life balance.  Excessive amount of hours expected from management team.  Senior management not supportive."
good,"a typical day running reports and managing supplier needs, Management team are not so good there's alot a micro managing. The culture of the company is nothing like it was a few years ago and based on seasonal employees its not what Sam Walton based his company on. The hardest part about this job there was no accurate training you will need to be a self starter and motivator and find ways to learn the job, the supervisors currently in the role don't care anymore. Most enjoyable part of the job is other members on your team and in the company"
good,I do not wish to comment about this employer.( but) You have to be a kiss up to get ahead. The management does not follow the rules. This could be a nice place to work if.......
good,"I didn't enjoy working there.  A typical day was to clock in, work for 2 hours, go on a 15 minute break, work for 2 more hours then have my hour lunch break and so on. I didn't learn anything I didn't already know. Management wasn't the best. Workplace culture was very poor honestly. The hardest part of the job was rushing to find out which register you needed to be on, when there's a bunch of customers, or when the checks wouldn't approve. The most enjoyable part was meeting great people."
good,Working there was great people but they don't tell you the truth at orientation. Loved working there but family don't come first like they say. And the work is hard but I like hard work
good,"Walmart is a very busy and demanding workplace. We are always instituting new processes to promote productivity and innovation. In my 12 years with the company, I have learned all aspects of the business and how to effectively manage diverse teams of associates. The hardest part of the job would be planning how to effectively manage freight flow but I am quite successful in my areas. The most enjoyable parts of the job are seeing results out of the talent I have developed and the excitement of driving sales."
good,"I really did like my fellow co-workers. However, the management and rules only were applied to certain people. Managers played ""favorites"". When we had notes from doctors appointments, we were still in trouble for them. I would not recommend this job."
good,this place was a nightmare the days were long the hours were awful the people couldnt hold a conversation and you could get wrote up for anything i mean anything
good,"better management, good hours if full time, good people you'll meet there, always work to do, management sucks and lazy, thief always occurs, but overall it's not too bad"
good,i enjoyed working for walmart because of the people. the company itself is not fund to work for or with.they expect you to be ready and willing to work for you at any time at any cost.
good,Walmart was an alright place to work as a first job. It was just difficult to advance from where I was. I did several different jobs while there but couldn't seem to advance.
good,"I was apart of the night remodel crew, so i only stocked the sales floor during my training period there. I spent the remainder of my time there assembling amd disassembling shelfs."
good,Opportunity for advancement is suitable but pay and management could use a bit of work. Hours are consistent. Management does not tend to treat employees with any respect.
good,It was okay as far as retail goes but the hours were terrible. Overall I did enjoy working there but during the holidays sometimes people expected too much for a single person.
good,"Working at the busiest Walmart teaches you to watch your temper and have patience.  A typical 8 hour day consists of answering many customer questions, packing out freight on the sales floor, and constantly cleaning up messy shelves.  Management do what they can, but some probably need a bit more training  to become more qualified to even hold that title as they are sometimes clueless.  Associates and department managers pretty much keep the store up and running .  The associates in the store,although sometimes segregated to their cliques all get along and enjoy each others company.  Our lunch breaks are probably the most enjoyable part of the day where we actually get to relax and unwind.  The hardest part of the job is when we're pressured to do multiple tasks while trying to help and move through the customers all while trying to keep the store safe and clean."
good,"They can expect impossible odds, high stress from managers and work, little to no regard of issues coming up in life. Overall would not recommend working here."
good,The walmart job is something i just needed to get by in school I worked late nights and they had lunch breaks and other breaks but some people are not fun to work with and some are. at the time i was working the management were good.
good,Wal-Mart used to be nice to work for family friendly and working with ur schedule it was become more strict with hours and no longer work with you.  They want you to do the amount of work for 10 people and hold accountable if it's not done.  Managers don't help out either
good,"Walmart is the industry leader in retail sales.  It is very disappointing that local management cannot come in line with national management.  For those employees wishing to do the right this for the customer, you will find it frustrating.  It is a culture of putting out what ever fire is in front on them, when simple planning and follow up on execution would alleviate at least 50% of wasted productivity."
good,"They were ok to work for but they didn't understand family they always talked about a work day consisted of me stocking the floor taken orders and cleaning the bakery, the hardest part was there was never enough employees the enjoyable part was the customers"
good,I am the only floor stocker currently. There were 4 positions but change to only one person. My position can be tough at times with the heavy load and so many places to stock throughout the store. The manager is very unprofessional and passes her tasks onto others when she feels the need to not feeling like completing the task herself. She also belittles her staff and make fun of the way they talk. It is a high stressful areaa to work in. I would not recommend anyone working in that department.
good,"Nice place with good people you can trust. Enjoyed me time here. If you are starting out of school or looking for employment while attending college, it is a great place to start. When there is a good Management team you couldn't ask for better. But unless you are short timing  or Manager potential ensure you plan an alternate work."
good,"Started as a Deli Associate. It was a new experience working with food. Sometimes it could be an unforgiving job, as sometimes you had that one person that wanted a meat shredded that was almost impossible to shred. For the most part, co workers would jump in and help as needed. In my opinion the hardest part was closing duties as with food service, there is a lot of work within a food preparation area."
good,"Walmart took me pretty quickly, and while they payed well. The store basically stole my life from me as pretty much all my free time belonged to them. I was also only 4 hours short of a full time, so they didn't have to give me benefits. Walmart was just really bad to be honest."
good,If you like to work theres plenty of work to do.. attendace is very important to maintain or you will lose your job. They do allow rehires so you can possibly get your job back
good,Nice place to work if you like to be busy at all times. No dull moments. Salary too poor and increments come in cents. sometimes favoritism is so evident
good,"Clock in and do the job you applied for. They train you on what they need you to do. Expect management to set unrealistic goals for you, then punish you based on their shortcomings. All in all easy work, ok entry level pay."
good,"Very challenging workplace where time management skills are key to be successful.  The most challenging portion of the job is managing the size of the building and all of the moving parts that are required to help the store make sales, become profitable, reduce shrink, reduce turnover and increase customer satisfaction for availability of product every single day."
good,It used to be a fun place to work. The benefits aren't bad once you are able to get them but it could take awhile. One of the main reasons why I'm looking to leave is that they adjusted their yearly raises.
good,It was surprisingly one of the more laid back jobs i had but the problem besides your typical management issues is the fact that you cant get benifits if you are part time and no one can get full unless you are managment or better because of a policy they have. they say they have to balance part time and full time even though it is a 24hr store. That and they make millions of dollars and pay very little with no over time. most people use theyre discount on walmart products to so the money you earn goes right back to them...
good,Wal-Mart is a good place to work because u get to meet people.I have learn a lot from working for them.I learn how to do price changes and throw ways and other things I learn a lot .
good,"At Walmart, you don't learn any skills that prepare you for any other jobs (excluding similar stores) but the benefits of working there are pretty good. A 10% discount off of any item and benefits may make the job seem more attractive."
good,Helping customers located items or show customer where certain departments were located. The hardest part of the job was walking home after a hard days work. But it was a good walk 2 miles from home.
good,ahora ultimo la empresa no esta muy bueno para trabajar y el ambiente laboral esta por hay no mas
good,It was ok to work at this place it just that they just don't know how to treat there employees they be understaff I was just one person doing everything
good,"Worked there for 19 years, very cut throat company and a lot of politics and cut throat. managers that do not uphold integrity and retaliate when ethics issues are brought up. its very poor that this is what this company has come to."
good,I enjoyed working here most of the time. We were short handed a lot of the time and management was more of a hinder than a help a lot of the time. They never seemed to have their ducks in a row and everyone was going in 10 different directions.
good,"In the beginning of my time with this job, I hated it. I didn't like standing and saying hello to every person that walked by. After I changed departments, I enjoyed my job. Not only was I moving around more, I was getting things accomplished, other than standing behind a register ringing up items."
good,Good company just bad placement and scheduling. Very friendly and Outgoing workplace. Wish the management wouldve taken their jobs seriously. Overall good store just needs better managent
good,Es un ambinente muy bueno se trabaja en equipo te ayudan a salir adelante y te ayudan a que aprendas muchas cosas
good,"This job was a very good learning experience. Mainly how to unload trucks, work a line for freight, pick items for inventory, and stock items on shelves."
good,"Its all about profit, they use and abuse you then toss you aside, over worked with unrealistic targets."
good,"unrealistic expectations and production goals for certain positions.  breaks are too short for 12 hours, only two 20 mins.  Start out the day almost 1 hour behind in your expected goals and you need to make up that time."
good,"Poor management place is very dirty and not safe to much  favoritism, poor management experience with managers. Very poor work environment. No holiday pay no bonuses and no vacation time pay. Pay is good but no hours so is like your making 11 an hour."
good,My experience  with Walmart overall was lackluster and somewhat of a disappointment.  No real support from management and customers could be unkind and rude at times same with the coworkers. The few nice  coworkers and customers I met were very good people.  The pay is good  and had an annual increase. Under new management it's suffered and had problems accommodating my set schedule.
good,"Fair pay and great place to work, however, I found advancing into higher postions difficult depending on store politics.  Each job is different and each workplace has its own set of rules, politics and idea of proper management and Wal-Mart is no different."
good,Es una empresa estable que no valoran al personal y no hay oportunidad de crecimiento.
good,Needs better policies on certain aspects to ensure fair treatment. Good availability for time off and working with schedule. Decent pay range. Option to switch departments.
good,It is a very strenuous and loud warehouse on a production system. Pay is competitive and benefits are good but management has gone down hill and not a good fit for a family man cause you never know what time you get off. My case I had an hour drive there and back. Management seems to have gotten greedy caring more about production than the associates.
good,It was difficult to communicate with the managers our needs in the deli and obstacles finishing the tasks and responsibilities given to us. I left because the hours were too stressful for me as a stay at home mother and the managers did not show initiative to work with their employees to better the job and atmosphere. It was also difficult working with people who cared more about the effort they had to put out versus the quality of the food they served to paying customers.
good,A typical day working as a people greeter consisted of greeting customers and assisting them if necessary. I learned more about retail and gained a lot of customer service experience. The management was okay. The workplace culture was pretty laid back and friendly. The hardest part of the job (which in my opinion is the easiest part) would be standing up for a long period of time in one spot. The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting the customers into the store and making them feel welcome.
good,"La administración de la empresa muchas veces se olvida de los colaboradores ocasionando un clima laboral conflictivo dando pie a la rotación de personal inmensa que tiene, por consiguiente demandas laborales y mal trato al mismo."
good,Temporary sales position...worked in all departments including backroom stocking.. not much room for growth in the company but job did have steady work hours with regulated pay.
good,"Walmart has a high turnover rate, people come and go due to work environment. Most of the time you are given more work then you can handle. Benefits aren't to bad, no overtime."
good,Management tends to be a bit loose at times; not really taking care of things in the best way. Other employees can be rude and are favorited by management.
good,A crazy place to work. You are almost guaranteed to keep your job as long as you show up no matter your performance. Management is clickey and slow to get things done that are needed. Being a hard worker gets you nothing but a target on your back.
good,"On an overall I did enjoy working for Walmart. Dealing with customers in any job can both rewarding and challenging. The upside was that you had the chance to learn multiple areas, and growing your understanding and knowledge of each area in the store wasn't only encourage but recommended. However the down side to that was that management would then take advantage of it, and demand you do the work of a position that while you might know, would not be compensated for or even given the position for. In such a large store and retail chain day to day tasks were often made harder than necessary and the reason being a quote you heard often around the store. Too many chiefs, not enough Indians. We were always understaffed, and members of management would go over notes and ask you to do a certain task one way. However that one way would change several times before it was finally done. by different members of management and sometimes even the same manager. all par for the course yes, but communication goes a long way. "
good,"management at this particular store 8745 has terrible management, they invest no attention in to the employees that deserve advancements on this stores crew roster"
good,I know people who have worked at different walmarts across NC and pretty much all of them quit their job due to unfair management. Such acts as workers sleeping with bosses for raises and higher positions at more than one store. The employer does not care about you or what you do on the job pretty much.
good,"The job itself isn't bad, but management could be better. For a college student they work well with your schedule and the pay is decent for the work you do."
good,Working at Walmart was nice. Good pay for some of the departments. Customers and other employees were chill and made the job fun. Some of the main management needed to get it together though. Overall I loved working there.
good,"Main problem is cutthroat competitive corporate culture which undermines teamwork. Think carefully before accepting a management position, it is not for the fainthearted."
good,"This job requires a lot of initiative to succeed in. This is mainly because the shifts are chronically understaffed. This means that you will be perpetually busy and while this is not necessarily a bad thing, it means you are probably being underpaid."
good,"Always able to get stuff done in a timely matter. Customers had pretty simple questions, easy to direct people around the store and help them find their product. More of a starting job than anything."
good,"They don't believe there is anything siuch as a sick day, or a doctor's excuse. you will be penalized for any abscence even if it's just documented no matter how valid it is!I would not recommend any friend go there unless you are plain desperate for a job at the moment!"
good,"Company does not have a lot of cashiers in which I applied for, so they give you long grueling hours that's close to full-time employment. Management was decent until they fired old managers and brought in new ones. It's an easy and comfortable work environment, but would recommend if you are in need of a job that gives you a lot of hours."
good,"Boring work, but not too bad - certainly not difficult.  Most inconvenient aspect about working at Walmart is the lack of stable work schedule.  If you're not interested in talking to your co-workers or interacting with them, then the cashier position will probably suit you well.  The break-room was quite large and nice, sometimes snacks were provided."
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,"the average work day consists of clocking in, sitting in the break room and getting informed on the expectation for the night."
good,it may be a great place for some people but my direct supervisor had a problem with women particularly young women and she was rude to all ot=f them i heard just weeks after i left she was fired so it may be a good place to work again
good,Walmart is a well known business it has everything you need all in one employees are very busy and some are friendly but should always have a smile while working
good,I loved my job working for them but my only problem with the manager was that they don't ever appreciate the hard work you do for them they are always with there nose stuck up in the air.
good,"A day at Walmart  is all about customer service, making sure customers are satisfied with their Walmart experience. My job was money handling. I cash customers checks, and made sure I had enough money in my drawer to support the amount on their check."
good,too much dysfunction; They have some awesome leadership and great ideals to mold their people however they have some unfair leadership as well. Great way to start a career and learn some basic skills.
good,"They over work there maintenance people, they expect one maintenance person to do the work of three each day.  When I did the maintenance at Walmart I swept, mopped, vacuumed, picked up trash in multiple areas of the store assisted customers, and took care of the grounds outside of the store."
good,I've learned customer skills & stocking skills. Also I have learned how to be more interactive with people & my teamwork skills have improved a lot more.
good,"good work and time goes by fast"
good,"This was a place I would never work at again. the job was fine, and so were my coworkers. but management was a nightmare. almost never gives full time hours to hourly employees and only gives benefits to full timers. Its kind of the worst."
good,"My work day begins at 7am,i learned to make the best of my work day. by making sure the customers  a good shopping experience. The hardest part of the job is doing evaluation performances based on one question. T he cultures beliefs are well rounded company based and fit for each individual  person in its own way."
good,"my managers conflict each other, my job is very demanding, they're never enough people on shift. I don't get very good hours, my co workers slack on everything. its impossible to advance"
good,Walmart is a large company that probably should pay their employees a lot more than they do especially cashiers because they deal with a lot of rough stuff and have to smile through it all.  Receiving benefits is great but take forever to qualify for them and they can be expensive.
good,The employees at WalMart make your day. There are many hard working and dedicated individuals there who help to encourage your job growth. There are many different departments and opportunities present to the right person.
good,The  hardest part of this job was being short staffed at all times. Its  a very stressful work environment. The best part of the job was interacting with customers.
good,"Aprendí el cobro de mercancía, manejo de dinero en efectivo, tarjetas de crédito, fui corresponsal bancario, atención al cliente, aprendí a llevar una buena relación con mis superiores, una buena relación con mis colegas el trabajo en equipo, la parte mas difícil del trabajo era los horarios por que por lo regular me manejaban como horario intermedio ya que era el horario mas pesado en el día así que eso era lo mas difícil para mi, lo que mas me gusto del empleo fue el aprender a manejar el efectivo, el aprender el cobro por tarjetas de crédito y el ser corresponsal bancario."
good,"Working for Walmart for almost two years I would have to say that things got worse the longer I stayed there. The managers would sometimes speak down to us (totally disrespecting us) and rarely give us words of encouragement. I was an unloader so I was in the backroom most of the day, and on those hot summer days we would ask for something as simple as a fan or even some cold bottled water and it was usually a problem."
good,What to really say it's walmart...  I worked multiple positions at different stores.  Walmart will take you where every you want to go if your motivated you can easily promote
good,Walmart was a place for employees who wanted to show their hard work and dedication. Employees had to contribute and work as a team in order for an outstanding job.
good,A typical day of work consisted of stocking the shelves and helping customers find products.  The last two hours before leaving involved picking the products for the shelves.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with all kinds of different people.
good,"the perfect student job or someone between jobs, but difficult to handle. some of the management was awesome, and made the job easy and efficient, and were a joy to work with"
good,work hours were not consistent. the staff was really strict and always were rude to new hires. The employment process was lengthy. although the store was always relatively clean and up to date on maintenance.
good,"If you love interacting work customer's like myself, then it's  a great place for you. You have great benefit opportunities with okay hours. Draw back management nor great, can't trust them or half of your co workers."
good,"The biggest thing about my time at Walmart is that it felt like family. When I was hourly, the friendships made will last a lifetime. When I became salary Walmart consumed my life. But that goes for every management position. The new company initiatives are great. They're sometimes tough to implement. But overall the culture and environment is what brings people together"
good,"Majority of jobs are part-time with few benefits."
good,"The management at this specific Walmart was very poor. They didn't care at all about school priorities and they would schedule you on days you requested off on a frequent basis. They wouldn't let you go in to try to get times changed unless you asked someone higher than your direct supervisor, and the direct supervisors were very rude to the cashiers. Also, when ill at work, they didn't allow you to take a few minutes to rest and would make you deal with your sickness while at the register. Just an unfortunate working situation."
good,The hours depends on your work performance as long as you work you will be scheduled for the time you have requested. Management will at times assist you as best as possible. At times it is difficult to maintain the class required to be completed until  mandated so
good,"I started as a cashier and moved up to a department associate which was nice and I liked it, good people. pay could have been better but some benefits made up for some of it, make sure to ask for a higher pay rate if you think you deserve it, I asked for 8.50 which was more than I had been paid before. at the time I had a year of retail experience but a guy that got hired at the same time just out of high school got 9.50, completely unfair. management had a real attitude problem and the reason I quit was their ignorance to change my schedule even though I gave 3 weeks in advance so that I can work two jobs. of course they told me that if I miss work I will be fired, I quit the second she said that. if that never happened and had different managers I might have still been working there or until I got my degree."
good,it is a pretty good job. The over night stocking is very busy there is not really any down time it is very physical. The holiday season is very busy. There were a lot of opportunities for overtime.
good,"It was alright not to great, worked you like a dog but didn't pay well. The people are overall great there, nice fun people no drama amugst each other."
good,"I really enjoyed our fellow workers... great bunch of people , we get great and not so great customers.. which is expected in this line of work..Management needs to communicate better with associates.. the most enjoyable part of my job is solving problems for customers and fellow associates... i feel great knowing i helped them !! i learned that they hire you for work and not to have a opinion and never put your idea's out on the table... they don't like that!"
good,"Other associates make the day go smoothly and understand the issues within the store.  Management barely is around and when they are it is not to help, moving up is almost impossible within a year depending on the store location."
good,He money there is wonderful. The managers always answer your questions. Fun environment to be around. You don't have to clock out On your 20 minute breaks.
good,Poor management can be contridictive and confusing. Their support managers can also be biased and unfair to certain employees and other staff. Looking for a better job other then Walmart
good,"no comment  need more employees on the front line it gets really stressful without the proper help we can not make this a success. "
good,"love working with people, the work was engaging and paced, but managers would change rules every other day, and some people could do little to no work, whereas others had to pick up the slack and would be punished for not doing two peoples work while the one barely working would be praised."
good,Walmart will tell you one thing then go and tell  you that you was wrong I only worked there for 2 months I only quite because they have a policy that say u have put time you won't off in 3 weeks early so they can find a replacement well they told me that I had to work on Saturday two days before it came up and I made plans with my family is went to talk to store manager he told me to talk to associate management I did and the lady said either u work it or quite it didn't matter to her I asked again and told her I have plans with my family and she said them was my opinions so I quite they said they was family-friendly but that didn't seem family-friendly to
good,"Most days at work involved being threatened, yelled at, and disrespected. However, as time went on, new managers came along helping out the situation and were determined to make it better. I definitely learned how to manage patients when it came to my customers. The hardest part of the job, in my opinion, would be the fact that managers were not ""on the same page."" They had a hard time communicating so we were told to do different things by different managers. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the fact that managers tried to be friends with you."
good,nada de ambiente muy personalista no apoyan al empleado
good,been working there for over a year now and management has been crappie no one shows you anything unless you ask which is expected. co-workers are great and customers can be a drag but other than that's its an ok job
good,Some of Superior Management are so disrespectful to employees they treat them like they are stupid. CSM bust there assess and management are never happy.
good,"I enjoy working with my coworkers and associates. Furthermore, I worked multiple positions yet get paid for one position.  I learned several positions which has given me a great set of skills."
good,I work at a brand new Wal~Mart and it is a challenging job at best. I am a customer service manager at present. This is a stressful position because of all of the rules the company has set forth. You are expected to keep up with these rules and they change almost daily. The management team has almost unrealistic expectations of all of the employees and the lack of appreciation for all of the hard work they do. It is not an easy place to work and the lack of communication does not help. The company does not give any benefits as far as I am told unless you pay for them like health or dental insurance. They work on a point system if you have to call off for any reason and  have a doctors note or accident or sicknes you are given a point no mater what. After a certain amount of points you can be fired on the spot. I don't feel this is a fair system but I suppose they have their reasons for operating this way.
good,very understaffed too much shifting of supervisors at this store(now site of TRAINING ACADAMY) I enjoyed helping customers to solve their shopping needs when asked to help by the customer
good,"After the company wide pay increases, the family friendliness of the job deteriorated.  Unfortunately it has led to the loss of great employees due to an absentee policy that has no leeway for emergencies or parental needs.  And that atmosphere has gotten worse.  On the positive side, the people are great and it is fun working there on most days."
good,The job itself was pretty good but the managers are hateful and say outrageous things in front of employees or to them. Not every manager is like this but it seems that the good managers are always pushed out or made to quit by being bullied.
good,"This was my first job as a cashier, and they do train you for a few days after orientation. As a cashier there are certain things you are not supposed to take up on your own, or may need help in finding the price of an item. They had managers on duty to assist in those needs. Sometimes you can call for them and they come quickly and sometimes you had to send another cashier to get them. It was very frustrating when one was nowhere to be found and the customer is waiting 10 to 15 minutes for a 30 second problem. "
good,Lack of communication between management. Also they base there sales of last year in order to set schedules instead of researching to see if it's ganna be a busy day or not
good,"it's good place to start.there is always up and down, but when you get use to it, it should be fine.nothing out of place. lots of experience and adventure."
good,The jobs at walmart are tough the management I had was great but walmart does not pay their employees enough money. It was a great learning experience.
good,"Good job for teenagers looking for a first job. Opportunity to learn the basics, gain some perspective, and move forward. However the environment is a bit depressing after a while. Coworkers aren't very pleasant, and managers even less so, and customers sometimes even less."
good,Walmart is a job until u can get something better because they need to definitely treat there employees better than what they do now so basically Walmart is an ok job
good,"Pay is every two weeks. The management team changes every two years and needs training by the employees. Hours are variable, you can not schedule a life."
good,When i first started Walmart i love everything about it but once you show management you have strength and great ability to do more than what they pay you for they will take advantage of that.
good,"Well, I was a manager at Walmart and liked the job.  It was a lot of work but did not feel appreciated at the job enough when it came to wages which made me look for other more lucrative employment."
good,"A typical day at Walmart, Hard, fast paced, and rude management not all just a few. and lack of communication, Micro management and Favoritism, and gossip a lot about other employees. no positive vibes. co workers always seemed unhappy and stressed.  no available leads when needed and lack of equipment that worked. a lot of pointing the finger and rude customer service."
good,This job had great benefits as well! The people were very fun to be around! Work was always fun! I never had a boring day at this job! They treated the workers very well
good,"Tasks were clearly explained"
good,"you're supposed to get two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch, sometimes you would have to get locked out of your register before you could go on break."
good,se trabaja bajo mucha presion y siempre quieren mas de uno a cambio de nada. Las horas extras nunca las pagaban ni con tiempo ni monetariamente.
good,"Back when I worked there the pay was 7.50, it is now substantially higher so if I worked there now I'd say the pay would be much better. Management was fun, sometimes chose favorites but I never had a problem with my supervisors. Only issue's I ever had were with customers who were very entitled, but I'm a people person so I handle that stuff well. Pretty simple job. Never had a set schedule though, biggest con"
good,"location i was at on oakland park was not good. management basically made you manage yourself and caught an attitude if you didn't know something. i got sick one time, caused me to go to the hospital, the doctor said i could not go to work. gave me meds and a doc note. i get to work when i was allowed to the manager refused to accept my doc note and said i should've came in. i had to go higher up to complain."
good,"While not completely terrible, Walmart was my least favorite job in the past. I didn't know my managers names, and they raised wages for my position after hiring me without granting me that raise."
good,over all it was a good place to work but it was a dead end job if you worked hard where you were at they will not move you up because they refuse to hire new people
good,"I've enjoyed most of my time with Walmart but some managers tend to lack the necessary training needed to do their jobs such as managing schedules, listening to their underlings, and not writing anything down. Hours tend to be the biggest problem people have working at any of the stores I've worked at since that's the easiest thing they can do to balance the budget. The only downside to this is that they never have enough people to cover the necessary areas. Of the stores I've worked at this actually affects the profits cause either customers can't find what they're looking for since no one is there to help or it hasn't been stocked since there isn't enough employees. There's probably no real fix to this cause it's an uphill battle but I think part of the problem is people now a days don't want to work and the ones who do aren't making enough to survive. Though i guess if they had more employees around the store they could deter theft somewhat since more feet on the ground means less area to conceal the acts."
good,I never felt as if I could ask questions about any thing I didn't understand. I was constantly forgotten about. It didn't feel like a family. Bad customer service.
good,Walmart has changed greatly since the death of Sam Walton. Sure the focus has always been on sales and the customer. Originally it was a more family/associate friendly company. The managers knew ou and cared.
good,You're treated like a retail employee...no mater what you do for the company. They treat you like you're replaceable. I'm very discourage to ever work for a big retailer because of the treatment that goes on in the work environment. It's sad to say it's never really the customers or the job itself...it's who you work with.
good,Walmart is a good place to work for. They will work with you on your schedule and when you need time off. The good about working for Walmart is that the work is rather easy to do and you get to meet many different kinds of people.
good,"I enjoyed my work with this company. Was not always easy working with other management. However, that is part of working life and learning to navigate."
good,"If you want a job that you can usually zone out and go on autopilot, it's not a bad gig. Little is ever difficult; the main difficulties comes from having to deal with customer service managers who don't show up to help when they're needed. You can generally get your breaks without much hassle, and you can do a lot of independent work without too much micromanagement from above."
good,I worked there for 2 years. I did overnight for a year and went to days the next year. overnight you practically get away with anything and weren't much stable management. Managers acted like perverts and always talk sexually about some of the employees. I dealt with way too much innapropriate comments that I felt were very unappropriated. Management sucks and don't care about their employees. I would never work there again.
good,the hardest part of the job was having little to no training and having to deal with management checking up on you every 5 minutes but working with everyone was the most enjoyable part of the job would i do it again? yes i would
good,When your fort hired usually the managers are cool to an point. Then some because more engaged in seeing you not successful within the company no matter how hard you work
good,"As a manger for Walmart, I found myself treating people like there were nothing. I had people making less than $8 hr trying to feed there family. They have no respect for workers."
good,I hated working here!!! The only reason I stayed as long as I did was because they paid me just enough that I could not find someone paying as well that close to home.
good,"They should train their employees to be more people and team friendlier. Over all the management, cashiers and stickers we're very friendly and attentive to their customers."
good,Working at Walmart was pretty stressful because they always asked us to stay over our required shift and the store I worked for was just very unorganized.
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Wal-Mart it was a steady passed and enjoyable job. I take issue with the tact and couth of managers to employee, motivation tactics should not include degrading an individual by comparing them to a child, when they have children of  their own. This was insulting and disrespectful of this manager and i hope your experience is better than mine was."
good,"Punch in, check to make sure that everything is stocked and fresh, and then prepare orders for customers."
good,The leadership at Walmart was extremely Toxic.  The management had no regard for personnel issues and handled scheduling poorly.  I will never work here again.
good,I don't really recommend anyone to work for Walmart unless it's your first job or you already have ha a main job and you do this on the side it's not worth it
good,"walmart isn't a bad company to work for.i was a night shift front end cashier that was cross trained as a stocker. you start you night out cashering until around midnight, then go stock for the rest of the night.you get one fifteen minute break every two hours, and an hour for lunch"
good,"N/A;; I do not want to write a review. Although, working for Wal-Mart you have to be level-headed and attention to detail. Patience is most definitely a virtue."
good,Depending on the department you work in determines advancement possibilities. Some department's have more regulations than others and may not be right for you. Favouritism plays a big role in your job and work load no matter what department you work in. Pay and benefits are unfair throughout entire store. I knew a person who was a cashier and had been working for Walmart for over 3 years. They were getting paid a little above $7.00 per hour. One day this person was upset. After asking why I found out all the new cashiers hired were starting above $10.00 per hour. Walmart takes advantage of employees wherever and whenever they can.
good,The day always went by faced for me and it is very quick paced so you don't feel like you're wasting your time. It is not something I would recommend doing long term though.
good,"i enjoyed working there. i like the fast past and helping customers with customer service. i enjoy meeting new people eveyday, provide great service for them."
good,"hard working positions, especially when you are the only one working, managers abused their position of power and fired long time hard working people for ridiculous reasons."
good,Pretty busy and short staffed.  I learned how to become a manager. The hardest part of my job is making the work schedule for the cashiers. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I have a made a difference in my customers lives.
good,"En general es buena empresa, pero muy mal trato a los empleados, mal proceso de reclutamiento ya que se basan en familiares de trabajadores, no hay comprensión de los superiores a los trabajadores."
good,"Asked to cover multiple departments as well as unload trucks and still expected to finish two or more departments by the end of your shift without help, asked to stay late even though they know you have school, try to force you to prioritize wal-mart"
good,Working for this company is not as bad as many say. I had a period of unemployment under my belt and my local store took a chance on me and got me back on my feet again. this is the place where I learned I really enjoy interacting with people and helping customers.
good,I work at night so some times it was slow but the people in the day time never did their jobs so we was forced to do double work it was always a mess and they often blamed the over night workers for things that we did not do. our job over night is to stock  but we had to clean  things up a lot and it took from our work in clothing area the afternoon shift never did their job in the clothes department
good,has issues with following your avabliablity and can't seem to fix issues around the workplace to make it more comfortable.  Constantly having favoritism between assistant managers amd associates so when some get away with things others cannot it becomes an issue to the rest making it seem like they don't care.
good,"It was not a good work environment.  The staff and managers, most of them but not all were not professional or behaved in an adult or role model manner.  They disregarded rules for those they preferred and not those they didn't.  Needs to be staffed with more professional knowledgeable people."
good,"I meet different types of people everyday. I've made new friends. I work part-time. Management sucks sometimes. As the self-check host, I deal with a lot of stress, frustration, and rude customers. Its worse on weekends and holidays. I should be paid more."
good,"I worked in the deli, the work was simple, the environment was good. The management didn't know how to manage the departments they were supposed to manage."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work if you do your job and stay away from controversy whit the customers that some of them don't appreciate your help, Walmart pays well and is a good pat time job."
good,"Overall, its not a bad job. I enjoyed working there when i had good hours. I enjoy working with customers. The pay is probably better than most other retail jobs."
good,"This company got me started in life,  worked with me while I went to school and was happy to do so. I can not say anything bad about this company but it was a stepping stone in life."
good,I enjoyed my time here due solely to my fellow co-workers. There is a great group of people that work for this company but the management staff need major improvement!!!! Its a shame when you have more people walk out of a job because managers don't care enough to fix problems with other employees!!
good,"Work here is very strict. Employees that work here are told how to do everything from how to talk, walk, and breathe. Management doesn't teams are very behind on their own work and expect employees to do it. Benefits are not so great, you must seek them out as no one will make it known to you."
good,At times it could be cool and non stressful but because of the management power struggle it made it stressful very hard to balance in the warehouse being in school and etc
good,"A lot of heavy lifting, which kept me in great shape. I learned to tolerate the ""not-so-nice"" customers. Management was the reason why I quit my 8 years with the company due to unreasonable changes."
good,"Lack of communication between department heads and the store manager make team work difficult. Communication should never be limited to text messages within the store. A hands on approach is more valuable to all employees. I, as a co-manager prefer speaking face to face with co-workers to ensure a level of respect regardless of job title. I have only been with Walmart for three years, and I am not speaking for all stores, but only the one I am currently working in. Walmart has some excellent store managers with great leadership skills."
good,"The job itself was not bad. being a pharmacy tech can be fun after you get used to the rude things some people say to you in the pharmacy business. I love pharmacy, but it just didn't work out here."
good,"My time working at Walmart was interesting. The managers were not so nice. They expected you to ask no questions and to know everything, and it just makes you want to figure out everything on your own instead of asking for help. It can be a great learning tool but also a curse depending on the situation. The pay was.. okay. Being a self checkout host isn't as easy as it seems. Monitoring four different registers as well as taking customers on the register in the front could get nerve wrecking, but it is very easy to do once you get the hang of it! Especially if you are a quick learner! The only problem is that there were some problems that I could not fix because I wasnt qualified to, and I would have to wait on a manager to come down and help. Sometimes it took forever which caused problems with some customers who were a bit impatient. Overall, working at Walmart was a fun experience. Getting to know your co-workers who have been there and basically know all there is to know can be a big help, and can contribute to you not having to ask your managers so many question as well as making your day more exciting!"
good,"I prefer to stay busy, and at walmart there was always a surplus of busy work. What seemed to be a negative for most of my coworkers was a huge positive for myself."
good,Everyone gossip to much. Other then that it was ok. You couldn't talk to other employs. Managment work you hard they wanted you to do your department and then go and help another employe that didn't finish thier work.
good,Enjoyed working for the company just wanted to finish school and spend more time with my kids on the weekends worked mostly all shifts at the D.C.  Wanted change something different.
good,"I don't like that I am not secure .I don't get the hours. I come in to help members of management all the time on special projects because they know I am more than capable to get the job done. They know they don't have to worry if I'll have it completed or not. I am part time, so I am not promised my hours which means I don't know if I can get my business taken care of. All in all, it is a good place to be employed at. It is a big corporation with many benefits if you are full time."
good,not all management but most are disrespectful and like to belittle or look down to others (non-management) The company as a whole is a good company. Some of the issues come in at the individual stores where there is poor management.
good,not a good place to work wal mart looks only after wal mart the small people get shut out terrible company to work for to bad people have to choose to work there
good,"A typical day at Walmart I would help numerous customers, I, learned commuter skills and great customer service. Management was helpful in helping me understand all aspects of what was expected of me but not very helping with teaching. The hardest part of my job would have had to be dealing with the line it was always long and crowded."
good,"Good Job , work is work. Just do your job and get off and go home.  Listen to management and look over your shoulder at all times. Nice hour lunches.."
good,I love working at walmart but i hardly had time for family or friends pay wasn't very good either and management is unprofessional all in all i enjoyed working at walmart
good,I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone . Very fast paced job if you work in a busy location as I did not fairly compensated for the long hours of your feet . Open 24 hours so you can kiss not working on holidays good bye . hat to call corporate for my dollar raise after completing my online assignments required .
good,This company could be better all the way around. Working here was kind of stressful only because I think it's kind of dysfunctional. Management need to work more as a team and coworkers will follow.
good,Worked eight hour shifts for this company almost 11 years. During my time with Walmart I enjoyed helping customers find what they needed. I was able to learn and execute different jobs throughout the company.
good,"The Walmart where I worked was a really good one to work at. Had its problems like any other Walmart, but the group of employees there were not typical of what I have experienced at other Walmarts."
good,You can't trust anyone at my WalMart store. Managers talk negatively about other coworkers. People threaten to beat people in the parking lot and management does absolutely nothing. I do not feel safe working here and will be leaving as soon as possible. I work 36 hours a week or more sometimes and they will not allow me to have benefits or become full time.
good,"Pay was good.  Only 33 hrs.  Next to no benifits. Always writing people up for dumb things. Hr department not good. 4 days off good. Brain washing by mangers. Hard to get production with aisle traffic. Kids job. Ok if you need a job, but not one you would stay at if you are able to get a better one with benifits. Expect to be let go in 7 to 8 monthes. Ra ra Wamart meetings remind me of North Korean  rallies. Everyone clapping afraid to lose thier job or life. What can i says its Walmart."
good,I always came in happy to see my co-workers and to do my job successfully. The coworkers are what help the day go by. The hardest part was seeing my CSMs stressed doing their job the best that they could and not shown any appreciation.
good,The time spent at tho job was well worth it. I learned merchandising and expanded my knowledge of lawn care and household repair. Enjoyed new relationships built with members of the community.
good,"As long as you slave away it's all good, but if you have any personal issues causing tardiness or absences they don't improvise. Benefits are great and the job itself is good. There are some workers who slack and are treated the same or better than the hard workers, and then you seem to be held to a higher standard for being a good employee when you're feeling down and out."
good,"Wal-mart has both good and bad sides. On the good side is the benefits are solid and their paid time off program is great, and if you work hard you can advance quickly. The bad side is management. As am assistant manager you have 6 different people telling you six different things. Each one does not care about the others agenda and you end up repeating things multiple times. Be prepared to get no credit for anything you do, and to work 70-80 hours a week easy. You have no control over employees as the can go above your head to get discipline overturned."
good,"Could use new managers, and more training for new employees! The work is easy but repetitive, same thing day in day out. Easily adaptable, if you are striving towards a goal."
good,A typical work day for me was. Making sure that i great the customers as they enter the store. As the customer leaves thank them for shopping and check their receipt.
good,Make sure u have around the clock babysitter. This job require alot of your late hours. U cant change your hours for six months and even then u want get hours if time is not open.
good,"Easy job, Easy money. I worked hard but never got trained by management. Worked passed 90days and still got no training. Management sucked no customer service."
good,"Management was nice, learned how to use a cash register, associates were friendly and would occasionally jester with other employees to make their spirits lifted."
good,It was fine its fast paced retail it is what it is. If you want to know you have to go and experience it for yourself everyones experience is different. has great beefits.
good,"At Walmart, I switched between Pharmacy cashier and learning Pharmacy Technician. The position was part time, although I worked usually between 32-34 hours weekly.  This experience compelled and allowed me to attend Mitchell Community College to become a Certified Pharmacy Technician.  Walgreens had offered me a full time position as Pharmacy Technician, which included benefits, and that is why I left Walmart, on very good terms."
good,Working at Walmart is a great learning experience there are many different ways to expand yourself if you work hard and show interest you can move up if you apply yourself.
good,"Managed all front end operations which includes accounting, personnel, upc, invoicing, customer service, cashiers, and layaway areas.  Also provided overnight management to grocery areas of store.  Other departments managed included housewares, crafts, sporting goods."
good,Relatively easy work with heavy lifting and demanding customers. Very buracratic company with little idea on how to properly operate or manage stores. Promotions will almost always be given to the least qualified and/or most incompetent.
good,"For the longest time, I really enjoyed working at Walmart. I could see myself doing it for the rest of my working life. I am great at customer service because I love it. I love helping people. Unfortunately, Walmart is making a lot of company changes that make it hard for people to work there and have a family life, or any life outside of work. I am a single parent. I do not have 24 hr availability to work. Trying to get the people at Walmart to understand that is impossible. Associates are tools to be used, not people with families, opinions or feelings. If you are available to work 24/7 without exception, then it's the perfect place for you, but don't expect to be treated with respect."
good,A typical day at work was dreadful. I learned how to deal with the day-to-day incompetence of horrible management. People could at least come together and agree on the unpleasentness of the job. The hardest part of the job was getting up to go to work and the most enjoyable was the fact you get a full hour long break.
good,I liked the people I worked with very much.  I enjoyed the work also.  I had problems with the management and the way they treated their associates. Favoritism was demonstrated daily
good,"Not a bad place to work, good for high school students or freshly graduated. Also good for people older than 50. It is easy work and you get to meet lots of friendly people."
good,"A typical work day varied based on the schedule of the trucks. On a truck day it was very simple, we unloaded the trucks, and got the backroom organized so that the overnight crew could stock it. on non truck days we usually worked a lot around the store. either stocking merchandise, organizing the store, or just helping in areas that needed it."
good,It`s fun to work here. Management is ok not that harsh. no pressure except for to finish your daily duties. The hard part is you have to do jobs beyond your responsibilities. the fun part is you do your job your way.
good,"The Walmart I worked in was a stressful environment. Not only did the employees help it t o be stressful, but the managers as well. Favoritism played a huge role."
good,"working here was not the best selections, the management wasn't very good. Would only work for about three or four days if I was lucky. Nobody was in a good mood when work started."
good,expect to much from brand new people who have never worked that kind of job.some of the management was alright but you'd get mixed messages all the time and get in trouble for not obeying them.
good,"Overall, it,s a great place to work. You may deal with difficult customers every now and then. Management is great but no opportunities for raises or advancement. Pay sucks"
good,Walmart is a good place to work while you are in school because the managers work with your school schedule and give you flexible hours. The most trying aspect of working at Walmart is dealing with the customers and their attitudes.
good,"This was a great job, when it comes to getting to know the multiples customers.  The hours where sometimes all over the place and there is a lack of communication between management and staff members."
good,"Walmart is an very great company to work for they are a lot of opportunities with this company fun environment quick pace always room to evolve the experience I received from working there c"
good,"All jobs have their pros and cons, so no workplace is perfect. Overall, the Walmart I work at is okay. The management there makes it difficult to enjoy the whole day, but other than the ridiculous management issues, it is a pretty cool job once you get use to it, and I have learned a lot from the Walmart experience in general."
good,Manager and shop supervisor works to help associates any any possible way. They work on customers vehicles when needed in the shop. New hires can learn a lot from them
good,"A typical day at work consisted of coming in having a meeting for about twenty minutes.  Then going to our assigned section and working the freight.  The work place culture was not good for me, most co-workers were very young and complained often which drove down the over all moral."
good,When started out a wal-mart  I got pay increases till I maxed out and they started reducing our hours and hiring people about  about $2.00 less per hour
good,A typical day at work was straightening shelves. stocking shelves helping other team members.The workplace environment was good. We all got along well
good,"The management here is awful. They do not respect you and they do not work with you when you are sick. The days are long and getting your hours becomes difficult come January. We were told that we would only be slow for about a month, and it's been almost 3 full months without receiving a full paycheck due to them cutting our hours."
good,The pay was okay a lot of good people and very busy it is a good introduction into the working world it trains you at a bunch of different skills you'll need with other jobs
good,"Uma empresa que tem um bom ambiente com os colegas, só que alguns chefes de setores nao são bons gestores de grupo ou equipe sem perfil de liderança."
good,Walmart. not to much bad I can say they are okay they worked with me when I needed time off ect.  just got tired of working hours all over the board from 5am till 10pm.
good,Everyday I helped a customer out with anything they needed to know whether it be information or direction. I also helped people and notify them when they left an item in the basket.
good,"I've started working for wal-mart aug 2012 i've learned alot & still currently learning alot about the company & how the company is changing everyday..i started as a cashier than shortly after i became a customer service associate than a customer service supervisor supervising cashiers, customer service associates, cart attentants & also maintance associates. Eager to learn more i got promoted as a department manager managing the homelines department."
good,"I am seeking full time employment and the big box stores will not hire full time unless you are going into a management position.  "
good,Back Room General Merchandise was slow but nice. Management isnt the best. They dont really communicate well. A lot of down time but isnt too bad. ...
good,"Very physical, high productivity. The job was good but always felt extreme pressure to hit or exceed productivity numbers and sometimes felt like that's all you were was a number."
good,"The company is not bad to work for,its the people they have running it. They changed the rules constantly and wanted you to do Jobs you weren't getting paid for."
good,Walmart is an okay place to work for if you are trying to get you feet wet in retail. If you are trying to advance in the company you need to be ambitious and make sure that your direct supervisors and managers know that you intend on doing so. Otherwise you are going to stagnate.
good,inefficient working system with unfriendly upper management. Felt more stressed working here than another job that I have held previously. Co-workers and the people were great management above department managers not so much.
good,The store I was located at had horrible managers. Except for that issue I loved working there. It's super busy around holidays. I worked in the backroom and I really liked it.
good,"The job, customers and co-workers are quite good. Management at this particular location however is extremely lacking.Hours get cut, but workload gets doubled and you get a write up if you don't complete your tasks. I worked in the fresh area, so it MIGHT be different in other areas, but based on what co-workers have said, it's not. It's a shame too, because Walmart as a whole is a great strong company to be with, management just needs to get on board and realize employees matter; not just about the dollar amount."
good,It's ok it's not the best but it gets the bills paid. I have been there 3 years and they have been good to me up until now. My hours are getting cut every week and I am full-time.
good,Other workers were very grumpy most of the time. Customer were generally friendly. Managers were friendly. Overall and okay place to work. A lot of employees were intoxicated on the job and it disturbed me that it didnt really bother managers and other employees.
good,A decent work place with a comfortable work environment. The compensation was satisfactory for the amount of work required and the scheduling was extremely flexible and accommodating.
good,My typical day at work would consist of helping customers with any issues that they may have about the service or that they could not find a certain product. Some days its hard to deal with some of the attitudes that I would receive but I would manage how to handle it. I loved being able to see the customers get the satisfaction of the service that they deserve.
good,"A typical day at work was pushing a lot of carts to the front of the store so the people t was acoming in had one to use."
good,"The staffing services provided short-term assignments.  The contractors varied from clerical work in warehouse to front desk receptionist."
good,"If you need the money and aren't afraid to work hard, go for it.  But it will be mentally stressful and overbearing. Everything is constantly changing and difficult to keep up with."
good,It was an alright work place breaks are to short. Employees were alright some of them were very rude. Managers were fun and good to talk to but also knew when it was time to crack down and really do some work.
good,"hello,"
good,"This job lacked excitment. I was to do the same task everyday. I didn't get to speak to other employees. I could not walk around or get involved in other work activities. They do offer quick advancement but not much of a pay increase. The only fun times is when holidays are coming up or school is starting back. Only because the busier I was, the quicker they day went by."
good,"The management really tries to add diversity to our environment. On a given day we are more busy trying to get the job done, but sometimes there is time for fun."
good,"I worked at Walmart here in Durham,NC. It was two females that got me fired one was the cashier leader and the other was our supervisor. They falsely accused me of something that i had no parts in, and turns out other employees heard the whole thing. I had a talk with the GM and later tried to go through the process of explaining my side to the process they send you to and never heard anything back I called numerous of times."
good,"Working for Walmart is a decent job. They expect employees to stock and organize shelves, help customers with questions, and assist customers with lifting objects if requested. The work is rough on the body, as the floors are cement. However, as long as the supervisor is good the job isn't bad. Walmart has a problem with mean and rude supervisors who do not get coached for their bad behavior towards lower ranking employees. If Walmart had a better system for promoting supervisors and checking their performance the job would be much better."
good,"What can I say, it's Walmart.  The pay sucked, but the people were awesome to work with.  We made the best of it, but the pay sucked.  I was there for approx. 5 years, made .80 in raises....."
good,"typical day at work was stressful"
good,"In this job the main job is to stop shoplifters and to recover company assets. With this, if you make a bad stop (someone that's not shoplifting) that could cost you your job."
good,"Typical day at work would include answering questions from customers, providing customer service per protocol, keeping workplace tidy and clean. Management had its ups and downs."
good,"I really liked working for Walmart if I hadn't been moving states I wouldn't have put in my two weeks "
good,"Working for Walmart was a one on one task and it seemed to go faster because I was on my own pace. I stocked dog food, auto parts and even more heavy items. My fellow co worker were always willing to help. I was always willing to help them out as well, since I would finish early."
good,"hours suck, some can make it there if they like you. not quite enough to pay the bills but its a job. id recommend it only if you have to. every store is different."
good,"Not much to say. Anyone working there knows that the job speaks for itself -- as in how mindnumbingly bland and depressing it is. Of course a job is a job, but with part-timers lacking benefits and meager pay and no overtime for those who want it, even full-time employees are struggling to live on food stamps. Low-staffed and the almost laughable bonuses make this job one of the worst there is."
good,"Giving appreciation for a hard worker employee. I'm unlike most give 120% devotion, dedication while focused the minute I clock in to work. I give attention to detail, I'm hard driven and mostly never sit back, only to see other's taking advantage of the system..."
good,Worked in the meat dept.Enjoyed what I did.Also worked hard and learned lots every day.Staff was great hard workers willing to go the extra mile.Work place safety they were very lean with there staff.
good,Decent pay but horrible work hours. And the advancement is based all on who you know...Management was fine when I worked there... maybe need to work on their communication skills.
good,"Department Manager is very disrespectful and plays obvious favorites. Has been reported repeatedly by several associates and nothing has happened."
good,"just another typical retail job, as long as your good with people its not too bad, only issue is management, they dont do much to help employees or customers for that matter."
good,"Each store is different. Even though it is not suppose to be that way. Wal-Mart policies are great when enforce, makes everyone's job easier. But when Department Mgr. think their area belongs to them and they change policies, and upper Mgrs. don't do anything about it, well sales go down, people get disgruntled, favor ism is there, and no one WANTS to work for them."
good,Great workplace but managers didn't work with us. The people I worked with were awesome. I started school and they didn't work with my hours at all. I even got in trouble for it.
good,walmart is a good place to work. i just want to move up in a company in some point and walmart is not the place to be for those expectations. it would be a great job for someone in school.
good,Decent company if you like working long hours and being active. Not really a job for a person who needs their weekends off and if you have a family. You will also work almost every holiday
good,"Its a nice place to work , it just needs better management. Walmart has great benefits and other opportunities, on the other had it was hard to move positions or switch departments."
good,"The only time I enjoyed doing this job was during peak season  for Christmas,  otherwise it was pretty boring with lack of customers daily. The pressure to get customers in was sometimes overwhelming considering the number one thing that turned people away were the prices."
good,"At Walmart you will meet some of the nicest and most amazing people through meeting customers and getting to know your co-workers. The management however does not fall into this category. They have a tendency to pick favorite and throw someone under the bus in order to protect their favorite workers, so be careful of that. You could be the most amazing associate, but if you're not a managers favorite, you might as well be one of the lazy guys."
good,"Being a department manager at walmart could be very intimidating, there is work to do from the beginning of your shift, up until the very end of your shift, sometimes there is not enough time in one shift to complete all that is required in a department managers work day. I worked over the counter pharmacy alone. Managment very rarely helped me out. I worked a lot of overtime in Walmart because the help was just not there."
good,"My co-workers were awesome and even my immediate supervisor was awesome, but the company as a whole is not really someone for whom I'd like to work. They have unrealistic expectations and aren't willing to stand by their associates."
good,"realizar e comprir tarefas"
good,Most of my career here was positive.  The company has mostly good people doing their best in what is ultimately a failing business model.  Unfortunately the only way for the company to continue offering competitive prices is to cut costs through either cutting labor or offering lower quality products.
good,Great people and atmosphere. Everyone there was helpful and willing to help you grow and learn as fast as possible. Only downside was how unorganized the management was.
good,I never forget the day that I wanted to talk to the shift manager and I waited for hours and no body was answering and there was nobody to listen actually.
good,"There were a lot of days at the job where the supervisors could really care less about you. Violating Federal Laws (denying lunch break because of 3 large trailers we had to unload until midnight), and mistreatment/disrespect from management was far too common."
good,working with public every day proved challenging and rewarding. co-workers were amazing and made you feel like a part of something. work hours weren't the greatest. great benefit with employee discount.
good,"Boa empresa, muito competente, sistema de comercio bom."
good,It's a fairly ok place to work. Generally not enough hours to go around especially during cutting times. Other than that most people are friendly but that depends on your area of course.
good,go to work find out what to do for the day and do the work at reasonable timing. worked with people that are nice and open to talk as long as you are as well.
good,Walmart can often times be very challenging. Although customers could some times be great there were ones that could often times be very difficult to handle. From that job I learned a lot about how to deescalate a customers and how to build rapport with people. Work environment could often times be stressful. The hardest part of the job was trying to deescalate angry customers. The most enjoyable part was meeting so many great people.
good,"when i first started working at wal-mart,i loved my job,enjoyed going to work but they brought in a new manager and everthing changed.it was no longer a fun place to work,people was fired for no reason,associates tried to transfer but was denied,later they was fired."
good,"advancement through learning other departments, cashier and machinery operation has been a very good experience. Trying to transfer to another Walmart in western Colorado could be a priority"
good,"Walmart has a fun work environment, great co-workers, decent managment, always a new task to learn. I learned how to multi-task between multiple assignments to be more efficient."
good,"management was not helpful, never around,treated you as if you were bothering them  there was racism in both the stores I was at. I enjoyed the customers and some of the asociates"
good,I enjoyed meeting and working with my managers and coworkers. The work was easy and ideal for anyone looking to retire from a life of hard physical labor.
good,"It pays great but the managers suck and are just really rude and awful. It's good for the experience but overall, it's not that great. I dunno. Benefits are nice."
good,A decent first job for recent high school graduates or college students. Not a position to take if you are looking to advance quickly within the company.
good,"A typical day at work for me is to come into the store clock on then immediately go to the fitting room to check my tasks for the night and based on the task I was assigned and go and zone the clothing department and I would run some clothing returns and cover the phone so another associates can take a break or lunch. I learned how to direct phone calls, manage a fitting room, and organized and zoned departments"
good,"Stock floor, assist customers, work registers, mod changes for the holidays and new stock. They had to many managers giving different directions to one person causing alot of confusion. The hardest part was dealing with management and the best part was the jobs that they allowed me to do, They were very flexible on giving me extra hours and letting me chose the hours that  could work with my regular shifts."
good,"Pay was fair. After being one of their best cashiers for over a year, management was very difficult when asking for advancement. After that, I became bored with the company and got fired for attendance."
good,Working for Walmart has it pros n cons .. it's a great company if u are working with people who cares about it employees has much as the company.
good,Very busy and lots of stressful customers. Learned a lot about customer service and satisfaction. Has a poor management and human resource relationship. Dealing with a stubborn hard headed customers.
good,The managers could have been better but there are a few that are pretty cool. It gets pretty busy in electronics especially between Black Friday and Christmas.
good,"There is a lot of room for advancement however the management only looks out for themselves and gives little respect or care for the employees underneath them. If you are going to work for Wal-Mart where there always tends to be a LOT of drama and discouragement, even at the higher class areas."
good,"In a typical day I normally work on helping customers by slicing their meat and cheese. I do my best to make every customer have a go time and want to come back to the deli. Over the year I have worked with Wal-Mart I have learned a great number of things, I have learned how to operate slicers, rotisserie ovens, and fryers. Some of the management is good while others don't really know how to talk to people. Wal-Mart have a diverse culture. The hardest part of the job is trying to do what everyone asks you to do. The most enjoyable part is all the nice people you met and making friends."
good,"Gained friends"
good,This place is ok to work for but there management need improvement they need to be able to listion to there workers and get real insite on how they are and what is needed to the workers and bot for the sake of the owner of walmart
good,"It was a very fast paced position to be in and very hard working, you got a lot of opportunities to move up the chain as long as you showed you were willing to work hard. The management was understanding and very attentive and the environment was very fun and relaxed."
good,"TYPICALLY , it was an okay place to work but management was sexist towards females. the atmosphere was good though because employees were nice and easy to get along with."
good,"While Walmart promotes associate diversity, the truth is something different. While they are more than happy to hire people of all backgrounds, keeping employee morale up was a large issue in my experience. Many people often complained about low wages, being ignored by management, and being told to do tasks not included in their job description. However, I always found my responsibilities simple and easy to carry out."
good,I don't recommend working here  the management is mean and they expect things to be done that you could never realistically get done in the amount of time they give you
good,"Incredible relationships with co-workers but horrible management considering your needs such as school, family, and personal time."
good,"A typical work day consisted of customer service and restocking for the next day. I learned a lot of communications skills, stocking, ordering, service areas, and use of a cash register. Management needs work on communication and realistic expectations. The work place is very fast paced and high demand. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with upset customers and finding the best way to satisfy them in a timely manner. The best part about the job are the employees."
good,working at Wal-Mart was definitely an interesting experience. While working there I got to meet many new and interesting people who all enjoyed their job and made the workplace fun.
good,"A typical work day at Walmart, would be me going and out of a cooler stocking milk and cheese all day. The management their was very understanding and flexible with my school schedule, work schedule, and goals to transfer to different departments within the store. I would have to problem going back to be an employee if needed be. I learned at Walmart that the hard work will pay off and is very much appreciated."
good,"evening shift ok, learned how they operate. management is ok, workplace culture is difficult at times. hardest part of the job is when you are not busy and best part is the Walmart associate discount card"
good,When I started there i started to learn how to do cashier and how to put away product. Work there was fun i loved almost every one working there. The one manager was not so nice to me and we didn't see eye to eye.
good,"everyday i go into work at 2 pm and starts unloading freight of boxes from a semi truck and place them on pallets that match the departments. Then we go to the grocery side of the store and stock carts of groceries that had been stacked by another team of workers. Finally we go back to the pallets we stocked at the beginning and pull them onto the sales floor for the overnight employees to stock."
good,Walmart has unorganized management that has little respect for the employees. Management has little to no work ethics and show this on a daily basis. If it wasn't for the lower class of workers the place wouldn't run. Even after I gave a two week notice and left because I was working two jobs management was rude and disrespectful to me my last days.
good,"Seasonal, no opportunity to advance in Wal-Mart .  Training as a seasonal was minimal. I would love to work for Wal-Mart, but not through temp agency again."
good,"More pay is deserved"
good,Being a Wal-Mart associate allows you to meet people from all walks of life. You are able to provide help and an enjoyable shopping experience. You also have the ability to become familiar with the regular customers and provide a more personal shopping experience.
good,"The work is straight forward but becomes troublesome when new department managers make work difficult. Difficulties include me not being able to sustain a good work/life balance, inconsistencies with the schedules that confuses my shifts and therefore messes up my sleep patterns."
good,"For employees at HQ, recently implemented a rule where you have to stay in a position for at least three years. This rule is very contrary to the way people work today. Executives came up with the policy saying it is good for our career. Fortunately, for them, they didn't have to follow the policy to get where they are. Now that they are at the top, they don't mind enforcing the rule on others."
good,"overall my experience at Walmart was mixed. I enjoyed the work, the customers and I liked the shifts I was given. Unfortunately, I ended up meeting a few issues along the way. I asked for time off at three separate times to go to a wedding, paperwork and all. Was told no but no reason was given, then later was told I never asked for time off. Management was rude and unfriendly, even to customers."
good,A typical day at work includes stocking shelves and helping customers. I have learned how to be more outgoing. The management tries to micromanage too much.
good,"No cumple lo que promete "
good,"I was a Cashier, and up for a promotion to manager of front end."
good,"Come in greet people who are on shift, find out how day shift was operating. Take in new customers and write their orders and begin work on their vehicle. Complete work and perform billing duties with the customer and return them to their car."
good,I worked the weekend shift on Saturdays Sundays and Mondays from 5:30AM -6pm and then mandirory overtime at least one day during the week most weeks. It was long shifts and manual labor but pays well
good,The pay is good for management. But there's no work life balance you're expected to be at work what seems like 24/7. And are hounded if you don't come in on your day off.
good,"My experience with Walmart was good, they give employees good benefits such as stock and a employee discount. Also if your store is lucky and productive you get bonuses."
good,"A typical day as a csm at Walmart involves getting yelled at by customers, associates and of course the assistant managers... It takes alot of patients."
good,Terminated because of a employee evaluation when they told us during orientation that if we fail the graduation assessment test we would be terminated. Never got the chance to take the assessment.
good,"While people might think that working at Walmart is all bad, it's the co-workers that you work with that make it all better.  I can say from insider experience that working at the Walmart that I did the co-workers that I had regular interaction and conversation with were awesome!  I can definitely say that it was the other employees who worked with you that made it better."
good,Job was very stressful. Too many things had to be done in one day for one person to do. There never seemed to be enough help. Some of the associates were great to work with as was some members of management.
good,"Co-workers are very nice and most are very helpful during working hours.  Many are underpaid for the hard work they complete.  The overall working environment and short staffs effect daily routines.  Its business first, family second."
good,Fast paced atmosphere; working with a great group of people every day to care for those entering to shop for their needs. I was the fist and last person they saw & most were happy about their WalMart experience
good,"Walmart D.C. is a great place to work during (Peak season), do to the fact that everyone in the temp agency gets a wage increase . But other then that walmart D.C. is just an average warehouse company."
good,"It is not a good job for a main provider, but it is a great job for someone to climb the corporate ladder with another income."
good,Is a good place to work.  Sometimes the customers can be a little difficult but overall is not too bad. You have your good days and your bad days but that is just a fact of life. The co-workers are great and can make your day better most of the time if your having a bad day.
good,Not a bad place to work. Management leaves you alone and doesn't care too much about day to day. Everyone slacks off which sucks if you actually are a hard worker and have to pick up the slack.
good,I learned a great deal first hand about people and actually working in a busy area which i love. Management needs a little organizing but overall was great
good,Walmart is similar to Sam's Club. Both introduces you to the business world. Good place for work for someone getting their first job.
good,"First thing, don't expect to go anywhere, I know people who have 20+ years working there and are still cashiers."
good,"Day starts the same as every other day at the store, managers demanding that you get your job done faster when you are working your hardest"
good,O que mas gosto é de conversar com os amigos que fiz la dentro.
good,Mangers really dont care or do their job. I was pregnant and had complications while working and the manager didnt care about what my doctor requested to help my baby and myself.
good,"a typical day is having assignments all over the store and kept busy."
good,"they overwork hard working employees, care more about impressing corporate executives more then daily shoppers, management doesnt care about associate moral, employees are under trained and dont care to go above and beyond to assist customer service"
good,"depending on what department i was in the duties had a vast range"
good,"- Un dia tipico de trabajo seria, tener todo listo para que el costumer haga de su compra una experiencia agradable."
good,"It was only a one day job for Walmarts black friday on thanksgiving. Was a staff member; observe customers. Some were polite, some rude. Job was to walk back and forth in my station. Couldn't do anything. Told not to socialize with any other staff member or customer, but customers constantly asked questions."
good,"A typical day is the usual customer service issues. Cashiers relieve each other for lunches. The culture is structured, but relaxed. The hardest part of the job was accepting that the hours you receive are based on sales. So if your location receives lower sales, the stores hours available for scheduling associates are cut."
good,"Buena empresa, ultimamente mala administracion. Se conoce mucha gente y se aprende a trabajar bajo precion. Muy buena escuela laboral."
good,"Working for walmart has been an experience. I've also had a lot of experience and opportunities. I've served as a Cashier, Customer service Manager, Inventory associate and Accounting clerk."
good,"Your basically standing in the same spot all day doing the same job, so it's pretty much repeating everyday for a week straight so you'll catch on to your job and schedule really quick."
good,"A typical day at work would be crazy the store had just opened and everyone was in a rush to get things done. I learned how to set mods, put up the steel hardware in the back and how to stock shelves. Management was for the part caring and reliable if you needed help they were there to help. The workplace was friendly, clean, and respectful. The hardest part of the jobs was getting in the short time we were given. The most enjoyable part was that everyone helped each other."
good,Walmart is willing to work around student schedules. They have opportunities for advancement. If you have the right management support you can go far.
good,The work place that Walmart provided were descent. On a typical day it was the same thing. The people I worked with were delightful and assisted when needed.
good,The work place at Walmart company is very fast paced and you have to be willing to do the task that is not being completed by others. The lack of communication can also be very difficult
good,I worked there for 3 years until I decided to attend college. I was a full time worker. I liked the flexible hours and the people I worked for were very sociable and I had friends there. They didn't pay a lot of money but it was adequate for me.
good,Most employees unable to get full time employment which prevents them from receiving any benefits.  Most employees unable to get holidays off or even 2 days in a row off.
good,I worked there for over a year. They worked well with my college schedule. My coworkers were all very nice and great to work with.
good,Currently working at the distribution center. Thought the years things have gotten worser there. Right now we are only working 24 hours and im a full timer. This is most a seasonal job . Although they won't tell you that.
good,"I got a big picture on working in retell. What it's like to have to work on Holiday's. How busy it can get, when to be more prepared to get really busy."
good,"Too much work, not enough time. Asked to come in early, stay late, shorten lunch, all for the sake of getting everything done. "
good,Although Walmart customer receive fast and friendly customer service the workers receive something totally different but not as bad as you think
good,"I hated working here. There were days where I had to be outside in a trailer for the whole shift, sometimes even past the shift hours, and in the heat. The employees here had no respect for each other especially the managers to the workers. I feel sorry for anybody that has to work at Wal-Mart."
good,On a typical day you are working shorthanded. Management is in a constant battle with each other to get things done. There is very little teamwork on a regular basis. Fulltime employees are not available.
good,"Depending on what time I would come in: finish other peoples jobs, face an entire row of groceries, mix paint, cut keys, sell hunting or fishing licenses, write on cakes, I went where I was needed. I was a ping pong ball from one side of the store to the other. I was supposed to be stocking shelves and re tagging and flagging prices in my department."
good,Work in a highly productive and strong employee\management interpersonal environment. A position where you are appreciated for your hard work and dedication. Trained on other positions.
good,"It was rare that management treated their workers as a person, I felt like a pack mule being pushed through dirt. Its very hard to get any type of benefits, and the hours were hard to work through. The cement floors made the day drag on and I frequently had aching feet even with insoles. Co-workers were either nice or very hateful, it wasn't rare for someone to turn against you for no apparent reason."
good,I've learned a lot while working at Wal-Mart.  The only thing that I had a hard time with is everyone working as a team.  The teamwork was not there like it needed to be.  The good part about the job was actually getting the job completed.
good,"Hardest part of the job is dealing with the manager, the co-workers are fun to work with and help you get thru the day easier. Not a bad job just very picky on certain things"
good,"The job I had in the fabric section was an okay job. The money was great, but it was hard to deal with the rude and unorganized management. I got tired of being treated like I didn't know anything."
good,the people you work with there are very friendly. the mangers on the other hand need more training. overall it is an ok place to work
good,"I've learned to ask tons of questions, to ensure all members of a group are on the same page and to trust gut instincts. I had to work over 40 hours each week and fell extremely behind when sick after a couple of days."
good,"Uma empresa que as pessoas são participativas e parceiras, porém falta um direcionamento claro da empresa como um todo. "
good,"Company as a whole is ideal, however inner-workings and management are not what is to be expected of a global leader.  Generic warehousing atmosphere."
good,"Good pay, poor work/family life. You have your day off when everyone else is in school or at work.The pay is good, but working all holidays and most weekends gets old."
good,"The job was not greatest, it was definitely not where I wanted to be. I was a cashier 90% of the time along with training on the registers. My CO-workers were nice and I enjoyed working with them."
good,"This job did not have any benefits to offer part time employees. Was slotted enough time for breaks and lunch. Customer interaction was usually always better than coworker interaction. Very indifferent on this place of employment, but I would return to work there if I had to."
good,"Es una empresa donde hay una preferencia muy notoria hacia algunos asociados, los lideres son accesibles en cuanto a horarios."
good,"A typical day, I start with the returns processing and usually have a few managers add more shopping carts of deleted items to the line of stuff to processes. Throw out the garbage, lots of garbage, print vendor returns, get items into claims, finalize claims to ship, finalize faxed claims to ship, process and ship vendor returns, have lunch. After lunch send out more faxes, sort and distribute new vendor returns, do transmittal's, Sort, Donation and Food Bank programs and clean up. Hopefully, no manager will come and add more duties to the list."
good,"Baja cultura de organización, desorden en general, es una buena empresa pero le falta más desarrollo"
good,"Depends on what store you work at I guess. It's really not a fun place to work at. Management does not care if you're sick. Management is mean and nasty. It used to be a great place to work, but ever since the new store manager came in, it's all about being clean more than anything. No focus on being in stock, never have enough help on the salesfloor, or in the front end. It's just awful. I used to love working for Walmart, but it's no longer a great place to work."
good,Deveria ter maior controle sobre as políticas de trabalho e maior eficiência do cumprimento das normas e exigências das dinâmicas de trabalho.
good,"Algo de presión"
good,"Exige mucho tiempo, los horarios a veces complicados, el ambiente laboral se mantenía, el salario es bajo, sin embargo es una empresa que brinda oportunidades de empleo"
good,"walmart is okay , but don't expect too much out of it & it also depends at which walmart you work at honestly because some vary. it's just different for everyone"
good,"Working at walmart can be very bad in the wrong department or with the wrong manager.  Customer service and cashier I would avoid, and the retail sections depend on the individual department manager, the person you deal with who decides if your job sucks or not- when you get off, approving days off, how much of her work she's going to make you do- ect. I have had departments that were great, so I stayed for 5 years.  Others I know had a very different experience in the same store."
good,A busy daily routine that keeps you highly productive. For the most part you stay active in working in your departments and everybody knows everybody to help out when you need it.
good,its an easy job just lacks in good managers and logic. the company as a hole has lost sight o its employees from my point of view.
good,An average day at work is usually busy. I have gained plenty of knowledge in multiple areas and time management and how to display merchandise to be eye catching and easily shopped to increase sales. Management needs to all stay on the same page and show more respect for all associates. There is nothing hard about Walmart and the best part is the rewarding feeling when you know you have improved a department or made a customer very happy.
good,I started working with Walmart in November of 2014 as a cashier. 5 1/2 months in they asked if I wanted to work as a cake decorator and so I did. I did cake decoration for 6 months and in October of 2015 I moved down south with my family. In october of 2016 I got re hired as bakery sales associate and I work in donuts and bread currently.
good,"Ive worked at store 1 as a sales associate for almost two years and had training as management and everything but you will not move up unless youre close to them. its a very hard place to move up if youre not friends with managers. Some aren't so bad, it just soley depends on them but its a very high favoritism. Learned a lot about customer service. its a great starting job as long as you can move up before you become a pet for managers."
good,"The worst part of working in TLE at Walmart was the manager. More focus on learning your employees strengths and weaknesses to more effectively task them for success. Constructive criticism borders nit picking daily. There are so many things being done right by the employees with over reaction to the mistakes. Pay starts at $9.00/hr. regardless of experience or training.  You will not move up the chain until they want you to regardless of your skills, motivation, work ethic, customer service, tenacity, or any other highly desired trait that employers ""want"". And by no means be ambitious. That will get you reprimanded asap."
good,"I went to work every day knowing that there is something different to do, but that wasn't a problem to me. The problem was how unorganized the managers and staff were. The managers didn't have enough work for us to do, so they would basically tell me to walk around until there is. That was the hardest part to me because I need a steady job that keeps me busy and is worth the pay."
good,"It is a very high stress, fast paced environment depending on what department you work in. It is a pretty good place to work and to gain experience in the customer service industry."
good,"I can't say it was all bad working here. But it was a lot worse(unorganized) than it should've been. THe management wasn't bad, but you had too many of them giving different orders over the same topic."
good,its a job alot of Favoritism and people guessing their way through. the software is outdated and can be a pain if not tech savy.
good,"I was on the overnight shift and I loved it, don't get me wrong there were times it got hectic but when you have a good team it can actually be fun"
good,A typical day at work here was sometimes very unorganized due to different managers trying to contradict another managers orders. The coworkers were all very nice and usually always helpful. the hardest part of the job was trying to get 3-5 different bosses orders done in a timely fashion while prioritizing from highest to lowest degree of boss. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a decent amount of time for lunch and free food for maintaining accident free periods of time.
good,"Forced to be competitive and petty to make your numbers. Management is more like glorified babysitters. They can't make any decisions about the areas they run. All decided by senior management, which is completely out of touch with want it takes to actually get the job done."
good,"Customer service is supposedly number one, unless you are unable to complete other assigned work because of customer service. Sporting goods is one of the most customer service heavy departments in the store."
good,I did not enjoy Walmart. They give you great pay but not enough hours. Management plays favorites. Once you are good at what you do some positions its hard to move up from.
good,"The leadership often seems like they try to pretend to listen and care but co times to find ways to reduce morale. Working hard and advancing doesn't make working there better, just adds more for you to do and they keep reducing the workforce that can help you achieve."
good,There are many different options for positions to  work in so that if one does no suite you or you are not as comfortable in a position there is the option to find one that does suite you.
good,It was good for when I needed it.  It was an fun job. Until I was hurt in a serious fall on the job. Then I worked in the fitting room until I was off
good,"I was promised a dollar raise and a bonus after six months, but did not receive either. I did a lot for them but the pay was not that good. I do admit that I got good unloading experience."
good,"ring up customers purchases, take payments from customers, thank customers for coming in, check prices for customers, management is good, but they don't give feedback as to whether you are doing a good job or not, co-workers have been wonderful, the hardest part of job is lifting large items that are heavy and sometimes removing security devises, enjoy meeting new people on the job and seeing old customers and co-workers of the past."
good,Fun place to work if you can leave all outside stuff outside and focus only on 10 things at once. They do not regularly employ enough people to cover really anything and it gets difficult to tell customers you have to be on the other side of the store to clean shelves and can't do your job.
good,"The management is very poor, but the customers are generally friendly. Just hope and pray you don't get hurt on the job, it's horrible tryin to get work comp approval for anything."
good,not enough registers open during the day are night shifts the staff and management could be a little more friend.. the store could be alot more cleaner the staff are horrible i dont like the food there the prices could lower
good,"Interesting meeting new people and assisting customers, work day goes by fast, hour lunch, decent pay, friendly co-workers, and ok benefits"
good,it was a good job in nice people i learn how to unload trucks in move placcet in stock diffent stuff my cool workers love me becuase i was frindly the hardest part was not knowing how but allway found a way to learn
good,"Worked at Walmart for 3 years , and was really treated badly . I wanted a different position and was given the other position but then treated me terribly at the other position"
good,"It seems to be a good place at first, but it's not ideal if you're looking to a long term job. Excellent place to gain work experience with customers and how to handle money"
good,"Walmart does not stay with your availability. My other coworkers are fun to work with, but sometimes it takes to long to do a task."
good,"Show up, stand in typical nightly meeting, go to assigned station, unload boxes, stock items, take break, stock, take lunch, stock, take break, face shelves, go home. I was good at all of this since i had already worked in a grocery store before. This was more strict since it is Walmart, but i feel the management could be a little more lenient on allowing certain things for comfort. The hardest part i'd say was being awake at night. No matter how much you sleep in preparation, it's still hard to cope with working at night. In my opinion,  the best part was facing shelves. If you don't know what that means it's when you make the shelves line up in the front and look pretty."
good,"Research and resolve dosage conflicts, potentially harmful drug interactions, insurance issues and other matters to ensure"
good,"Working for Walmart I have learned a lot such as how to face and stock shelves and work the top stock, which is what you do on a daily basis. Management in my store could use a little work when it comes to following through with protocols and your rights as an employee. The hardest part of my job is to organize shelves after a long day of customers shopping. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work with such great people. My co-workers range from enjoyable to not so enjoyable but those who I have become close to are amazing."
good,"You would come in and clock in then head straight off to your 1st task. They teach you all kinds of things. I learned how to use a scrubber, buffer and how to wax. The managment team was okay they're would be times when one manager wouldn't let you finish a task that another manager asked for you to do. Though the hardest part was defeinatly the organization of the store but in the end it was worth getting that gratitude from the managers at the end."
good,"The only good thing about this place is the pay and the other workers. The managers were rude and not very understanding. There was usually no work and wed still get yelled at for not working, even though there was nothing to do."
good,It's a great place to work if you are full-time on salary and with benefits. However if you are a part-time worker you have to scrape to get by throughout the year the hours only increase around the Thanksgiving and Christmas Holidays. You have no sick days or personal days. You have Paid Time Off that you can never get! It a sham! You can only make a living working there if you are full time or salaried. I asked for more hours but they denied me. They said they didn't have any. But then hired 7 new people. THen they fired me because I used some sick days with my PTO however they didnt approve me and instead said I was a NO CALL NO SHOW!
good,"If you're starting out i would recommend Walmart because this job was a job you just do what your manager says to do and you are done. Also when I worked there it was my very first job so i was excited and gullible to the environment like ""wow this looks cool"", but for people experienced in the retail or has had another job i wouldn't recommend because i felt like was was being pushed and blamed for things that were out of my control. In all fairness Walmart is not that bad all you have to do is play dumb and do the job because what i did was i was in charge of the meat department and the lunch meat with stocking all of it,so just do your job and don't try to change anyone mind because it could go good or really bad."
good,They took me off schedule for a week then put me back on there for the past week so i would have had 4 no call no show and i would have been fired so i quit so they could not do that
good,"I worker there as a job right out of highschool, the experience was one that I would call educational. Some of the management was not exactly professional, and they were not family driven. Be aware each store is different, and management is really the one who determines the experience."
good,"I will give it to Walmart they are a good company, especially when it comes to job work/life balance, they will work with whatever you have going on."
good,The management sucked. For staters each manager had their own opinion on how things should be done. but they are not walmart guidelines. Prime example a CSS manager tells a sales associate to do a transaction for a customer  and he would fix it in the system a little later in the day so the price override doesn't make the draw short but manager never fixed it so associate gets fired. over management stupidity but its things like that. That make working for walmart so difficult.
good,"this company is ok to work with,but it has alot of holes in it that are unacceptable. This company has no orgaization when it comes to keeping the shelves full and the employees happy. they tell you one thing and do something else"
good,"The work environment was okay, the only real problem I had was the managers constantly checking on everyone to make sure people were doing their job. I was more of a person who, essentially, is given the tasks they need to do and get them done.  You're given two 15 minute breaks as well as an hour of lunch. The work environment can get hot or cold, depending on the weather so always come prepared."
good,"walmart was perfect for me because i have no kids & had jus moved to a new state and started work immediately. didn't realize til i started making friends on how bad it took a toll on my like. i worked 4p-1a, sounds great right? not. some nights i want out til 4a.m but managers left way before that. did i mention the store closed at midnight. all i did was work, work, work with minimum sleep. imagine leaving at 3 or 4 a.m & having to be back early morning. they really dont like to work with YOUR schedule. its all about them"
good,Walmart is a nice place to work... All the managers and co workers are very friendly. The management is really good and concerned for all the employees.It is a place where you can work without any tension.
good,"It's a very stressful place with a lot of weight on everyone's shoulders. The comradery is low, and the management is poor. It's probably one of the worst jobs I've ever worked."
good,Working at Walmart can have its ups and downs but the people there will always have your back no matter what. They are super nice and supportive. Super easy to get along with and fun to work with.
good,"Constantly on your feet, lots of people interaction. Willing to train and work with you during learning process. Socialize with coworkers while ""redlining"" (waiting on customer). "
good,"Managers didn't seem to care at all about employees, they often gave illegal work hours and made you work them for example they would make you stay till 11:30pm and have you in at 6:00am the next day. so you didn't have an 8 hour gap in-between shifts."
good,Management treats workers as they should just do their job until time is up and go home to return and do it again. promised 2 position advancements and received none. major companies like this need overall satisfaction work asap .
good,It was a lot of work for okay money. Depending on certain days and where your working there is a good chance you will be doing a lot of work alone.
good,most enjoyable part of the job was the various of customers that came in. my co workers were very helpful. Management was iffy were to busy talking and do everything accept their job
good,very good place to work for people Too Many rules and regulations for all the wrong reasons no leniency poor advancement for workers
good,I gained 5 years of experience working there in a customer service environment. I handled large cash transactions. I worked in the morning shift and weekends is necessary
good,"Walmart showed me that You can move up in the company if you work hard. I started off as a stock boy, became a department manager, went through the training program and became an assistant store manger, all in about 11 months."
good,Clock in grab the carts and start putting items away. Rotate the stock and clean while you go. The most enjoyable part of this job was the night shift was easy to work and everyone got along.
good,"-Run register, and help collect carts outside."
good,"They ended up firing me for having to go to my doctor for a urinary tract infection and told me it ""wasn't an excuse."" Neither my family or I play around with UTI's because a very close family friend died from having one and not getting it treated. In conclusion, Walmart, or at least the one I was at, is horrible, but again it depends on the place and the management running it."
good,"Good job a few managers need to be demoted but overall good job, most associates are nice and respectful but I would reccomand it to people that live near not far"
good,"Being a sale associate you learn as you teach . you also learn a lot by communicating with customers,  and coworkers.  Walmart keeps you busy and there always something productive to do there, but when it come down to customers they come first and always right"
good,"Wal-mart was a good job i enjoyed the work and the people along with it. I was always busy from my regular duties or from another employee in need. I had many responsibilities from my main duties collecting carts and relocating them inside, to maintaining the cleanliness of the store. Other responsibilities would require me to help another associate in his or her department if needed."
good,"I worked over nights. The management was horrible, if you needed a day of the managers would get mad at you no matter the reasoning. My co- workers were very nice and helpful."
good,when working there. I enjoyed my work and experiences with co workers. But in any one store there seems to be too many managers and not enough workers.
good,The hardest part of the job they wanted me to do the same things over and over after a well the job just burn me out.When they finally saw me getting not to happy with them then they decide to changes things for me.
good,Overall it's a good company to work for . The company should be a little more understanding as far as attendance . Great place for advancements and growth .
good,The managers were very rude some not all and the new store manger didn't assist me with any of my complaints after being notified after being told slandering slurs and remarks were made towards me.
good,Just as the title says. I worked there for almost a year and a half with no suggestions of an advancement of position despite my constant pleading causing me to ultimately leave.
good,Always getting things done when needed to be done. Good vibes from towards Co workers to customers. Time flies when rush hour kicks in that what makes the day go by fast.
good,Mi evaluacion personal en mi lugar de trabajo pesimo el trato a los trabajadores.... cero empatia de los jefes.
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart was very hectic even for the hardest of workers. We were thrown many things with little to no instruction. While I myself am a very hard worker and very positive I felt it just wasn't the right fit for me.
good,Management seemed really good at the start but as time wore on it's all about that all mighty dollar. Of course every business is about making a profit but you really need to have management with people skills but most of them do not.
good,"Fast paced work environment always work to be done. Focus on urgency and speed in completting tasks. No reward for job well done or repercussions for not meeting expectations. No overtime allowed at this specific store, I do not like that."
good,The job is an easy one until management places unreasonable expectations on you. They raised the pay rates and tripled the workload on the staff.Job is not for everyone
good,"I've worked at two Walmarts and have friends/family across the country and I can say it seems that management is terrible across the board. Their training is a bunch of videos that don't really pertain to what you're doing, just the basics, then they throw you right into what you're doing. They expect either a lot out of you or nothing and don't really recognize others for picking up after the people they don't make do anything. They don't want to fire people even if they're terrible workers! Then they don't shift around people to make an equal workload because that's too much of an ""inconvenience"" to others."
good,I got hired on for seasonal. I was a cashier. I enjoyed it considering it was my first job in Florida. All my co workers were pleasant and enjoyable. It's definitely busy but makes the time goes fast.
good,well its very high schoolish it play favorites a lot of rude people that make you feel low  they do not show respect think they are better then you then everyone
good,Walmart is a very culturally diverse company in all areas. I enjoyed working with people from different backgrounds. I worked in seasonal so I had a lot of hands on with putting display together.
good,You will get started off at minimal pay even if you have good experience. You will be expected to perform management duties even if you were hired as a crew member.
good,"good for students and part time work, building a career at Walmart does not pay the bills. pay is low and does not increase very quickly"
good,You must be a really strong and determined person to work here. Management could care less about you and your co workers might probably be the only think keeping you there.
good,"While working at Walmartr it gave me the chance to learn many different areas of the company. My day consists of price changes, on hand changes. making sure the freight is being worked or getting it worked.  sometime the hardest part of my job is seeing that management are not all consistent  with all associates.  the part i love is satisfying  my customers and making them happy so they return to the store.  I am all about customer service.  I always have a smile and am told by many that i always am smiling."
good,Many long work hours due to incompetent management. Management is very directive and rarely ask associates for input to improve processes. Toxic work environment.
good,i think this job was an amazing experience and is a great first job for many younger employees. the hours were very flexible and they were willing to work around my school hours and made sure that i was home at night with my kids. plus... you got to eat free when you worked and got great employee discounts for your whole family.
good,okay job learned a lot work lots of hours non appreciative upper management made all employees not feel valued and continually gave us ran work with no incentives and expected to produce better.
good,"Day to day is fast paced, busy and productive. I am in charge of an area that includes approximately 15 employees daily. I also troubleshoot problem freight to help it reach it's required destination."
good,"Not a bad place to work. The management could be improved. There is room to move up in the company, but they never tell you when there is an opportunity, so you have to take the initiative to ask about advancement, and ask EVERYONE"
good,Es un trabajo donde se trabaja bajo precion hay q estar en movimiento todo el tiempo
good,"I worked for this company for less than a year. I stocked in the grcoery department, helped customers, and even helped to train new workers. The hard part of the job was the intense labor. Lots of lifting and pushing. I liked most of my coworkers though. They made it bearable,"
good,"Typical day having to come in and clean up what the night crew left behind and have your production done by 7am. I have learned that Walmart don't care about your health it's all about making the company rich, I don't recommend anyone to work for them. Management never on the same page and half of them have know clue on what they suppose to do it's probably only 3 managers that know what they are doing. Co-workers are very lazy and that is that hardest part for me to work with lazy people. My most enjoyable part of the job is HELPING/SERVING THE CUSTOMERS."
good,"Every job position is stressful, but their minimum wage is $9 so I guess that is ok. They will take advantage of you if you let them."
good,"The job was good at first, I was receiving a lot of hours during the holidays. As the holiday season came to an end the hours went down drastically. I went an entire month without any hours. the managers were nice but always let you know you were replicable. after a while I didn't secure in the job. the hardest part of this job was how they wouldn't let me work around my children's schedule. as soon as I was unable to work every shift and just morning shifts they started treating me differently. I would not go back if I had to."
good,"Over my time working with Walmart, I have enjoyed different things. They pay well and they have a good amount of flexibility for your time off. On the downside, the work day usually drags on, and the management could use a lot of improvement. And when you have your availability set, you will practically work any time that you are available with your days off being inconvenient and not often together."
good,"The entire culture is just completely off. As a Manager your taught to treat non-managers as if their actually beneath you in real life! With some serious effort it could really be a great place to work, oh yeah and if they where willing to pay a decent salary."
good,"The employees make working there enjoyably ,my job is to train new employees on their position and to help them,i am in personnel, help with benefits,schedule,"
good,"By far the best thing about my job is the people I work with.Most fellow associates are similar to a close family. The work is physically demanding. The time limitations set forth by management is entirely unreasonable. Management doesn't appear to appreciate or value their employees. Granted a few members of management will give a ""thankyou"" from time to time. Constantly being given indirect and contradicting orders makes working efficiently very difficult. Promotions are given out in accordance with favoritism, not skill. Some management had been promoted well before the required employment minimum time had lapsed. Obviously the employees are greatly under appreciated and massively overlooked."
good,"walk in tag ur ID. follow the usual schedule every day walk around the warehouse picking order place them on the skid and pull out to the front and lets ppl work on it. after, putting new merchandises in shelf make space and put the label on."
good,Walmart was a good job.  Working with the public can be hard at times but when the customer leaves with a smile its all worth it.  I learned a lot working with the public.  Management was ok.  The hardest part of the job was not having enough help and the best part was helping people
good,"A Typical day at work included getting bothered by Management more than required, huge work expectations on the Bakery/Deli side and more often than not, picking up lots of slack throughout the closing shift. "
good,"working at a constant pace, coworker where easy to get along with, but management would always over work employees, each day"
good,It's a cool job but they have a bad management team they pick favorites. It's easy to move up if you are a favorite there's people that have only been there a couple of months that have moved up faster than people that have been there for years.
good,Extremely fast passed and micromanaged work environment. Some very dedicated and knowledgeable associates as well as management. There is great opportunity for advancement.
good,"A lot of stocking and restocking merchandise. Management are very impersonal, since there are so many employees already, big property. Compensation, there was none, but benefits were decent. Environment is very draining, it's like no one wants to be there."
good,There's an a lot of favoritism. But over all the pay is good . The other associates is very helpful & nice . I had an couple of problems there & nothing was done .
good,To much pc police.management is not up front in telling the truth.tells you what you want to here then does nothing about it.easy drop and hook.dispatching is not the best could be a lot better.
good,My day would start at 4am or 5am depending on what i was doing that day. Still doing the work we would need to break down pallets and keep the freezer clean. The work are neat and organized even when we were working.
good,"Great management and job advancement. Overnight shift was fairly slow, but fellow employees and managers made up for time. Very face paced and organized"
good,"Great company just was not satisfied with the management team. They do not take people personal lives into consideration, they always complained even though i was told by numerous of my fellow coworkers,customers and other morning managers and employees I do a great job. Alot of unprofessionalism in the store I was working for."
good,The management was not the best. They did not try to work around your schedule unless you were in school. They didn't seem to care for their employees like a business should.
good,"worked in dept 56(plants) requiring me to run the cashier, water the plants and tend to the appearence of such plants for sale.mangement was very bad didnt treat their emplayees very well"
good,"Walmart is a good place to learn skills, but not a good place to stay and retire from. Pay tops out to quickly, Warehouse associates are treated worse than transportation employees. Not everything is fair. Health insurance is incredibly high."
good,working at Walmart has its ups and downs the benefits are good I LOVE my coworkers they make the job a little more exciting. When I first started working here it was EVERYTHING I loved going to work but as time passed It changed. Management don't set the best examples for the associates. I would have to say that the hardest part of working at Walmart is going above and beyond and then my managers not appreciate it.
good,Sam's Club pays very well for a retail job. The atmosphere isn't the best though. The employees are somewhat united but not for the better of the club. The management at this place sucks and it makes it very hard on the employees. They tell you that they care about you and will work with you when you're having troubles but they won't actually do anything even if they say they will. The people are nice but the general 'I don't care' feeling in the air makes it hard to work. Everyday I show up for my job all I can think about is getting up and leaving and never coming back. If you're in a bind and just need a good paying job for the time being I would suggest it but don't plan on sticking around too long for the sake of your sanity.
good,I Ioved working at walmart i also enjoyed taking care of our costomers only thing i didnt like was the fact that they did alot of illegal stuff besides that i loved working there being the fact im a peoples person
good,"Muy bien  , teníamos un buen ambiente laboral ,  trabajo sobre presión y en equipo"
good,Great place to work good pay and benefits get to meet good customers provide customer service. Delegate job duties to associates provide customer service
good,"A place where a person can be judged by there own work"
good,"Empresa boa de trabalha só os horários são bem puxados,mas boa de trabalha um pouco desorganizada nas funções!!"
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was never truly terrible within my experience. Most of my issues came from erratic hours, difficulty working around my school schedule, and low pay (before the $10 minimum was enacted.) The work was never difficult, which means it also got very boring."
good,I definitely enjoyed being around the people I worked with. That's one thing I will miss more than anything! Met a lot of nice people and it was nice seeing people I used to be friends or used to go to school with!
good,a typical day at work is making certain assoc have the proper tools for their jobs. Morning meet to insure we have the information and notes for the day. stressful and fast paced . enjoyed interaction with co workers
good,I enjoy working here. During the week my job is completely behind the pharmacy. On the weekends I stock the pharmacy and assist behind the pharmacy as needed.
good,Walmart used to be a good place of employment. Over the years they have become more about making money than caring about their associates. Due to poor management training and placement most departments are understaffed and the associates are overworked.
good,"The store has no organization.  They take advantage of you. Management is lazy. Only a handfull of associates work while others do nothing. They change your schedule every other day. And there is no place for advancement,unless your friends with a manager."
good,It's a nice place to work. You just don't have job security through the holidays. They hire you for the holiday rush and lay you off about a month or two after. The management is pretty good. They cater and give the workers dinners and gifts.
good,"My time here paid the bills. I started as a Wireless Associate and greatly enjoyed helping customers every day, not to mention I was in electronics which is kind of my element. It wasn't until I decided to take a management position over hardware, paint, and stationary that I began disliking the environment. I also found out I wasn't alone in disliking my job as a department manager. There are a dozen daily things that absolutely need to be done in each department that take, in all, much longer than an eight hour day, but despite that, you have every manager up the chain from you demanding that you do what they want done now. I get it. I really do. These things need to be done for the store to operate properly but there isn't the man power to do it. But like I said; if you really enjoy retail or you know you are good with people then by all means give it a try. You may like it because some do."
good,"Walmart pays good but then works you to the bone doing all kinds of jobs that you didn't sign up for. there is room for advancement but management likes to play favorites and I honeslty don't know where they find these mangers, again great place to work temporary."
good,"working a 8 to 5 shift, customers coming in helping them out. Making sales and promoting cell phones and TV's, the day goes by nicely. I've learned a lot such as communication, problem solving, leadership,and interpersonal skills based upon the job. The co-workers at the job is nice, helpful, funny, and friendly. Hardest part of the job is having managers that don't care, you could be getting so many feedback and compliments from customers and the managers would not reward you or say even thank you. They don't care about associates, and they give you a hard time. Most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. you can develop so many different relationships with the customers just by simply talking to them and asking them how their day is going. This what I love the most about my job, helping and caring for my customers."
good,"Worked as a Cashier in the Garden Centre and Cashier for the Grocery Dept. as well.  Logged into Cashier, water flowers and plants. Cleaned store area. P>O>S system training and grocery bagging."
good,Walmart is an okay company to work for. They are better than some other retail companies. I had to work registers and stock shelves. Move freight from the backroom to the front.
good,Typical day was working the cash register. I learned to be patient with all types of customers. The management was very helpful when needed. The hardest part of the job was getting yelled at by customers when the store was out of a product they liked. The most enjoyable part of the job was always meeting new people.
good,"Hallmark is a wonderful company and the store is beautiful. It's very inviting. Employee-customer relations go well. However, sales is obviously not for me. I have no interest in attempting to sell something in any way shape or form. Being on one's feet all day is extremely uncomfortable, pain inducing, aggravating, and down right distracting - especially when the employee wears dress shoes of any kind as opposed to athletic shoes or sneakers. The same can be said about wearing uncomfortable and overly warm dress clothing - specifically in the required arrangement of black slacks and a white dress blouse (while having to be thrifty because the future employee has no money). I fully realize this is standard and an important part in looking professional - the comfort of employees should be important too. Also, working in a job where one is on their feet most of the day or all day can lead to conditions like plantar faschiitis. Again sales is not my forte."
good,"The managers cross-train to the max. The downside is that your work hours flux so often that there is no job stability. I was working all over the store and still had one check with 12 hours then a following one with 32... open availability. The co-workers for the most part were good to get along with. Some of the management were people-oriented, some were me-oriented. The one-up on sales and opportunity to cross-train are definitely a plus here."
good,My job is being eliminated. I applied for Assistant manager but was told they don't want to promote within the store. Although they have done it before and two months ago at another store just down the road. They say my experience is great and they have no problem with me transferring to another store. Makes no since when our store needs an asst. And I have 31 years experience doing just that job!!!
good,"Buena empresa para trabajar solo que no cuidan a su gente, tienen pocos valores y no los practican en sus empresas."
good,"Overall, the Walmart I was working at was substantial when it came to training new employees. But management was lacking and there were a lot of work hours cuts. Also a bunch of our managers were stealing from the registers and other things. But I never had a problem with anyone and the people I worked were helpful."
good,"I liked working for Walmart , it was fun I learned alot on the way started as a cashier then was moved as an event associate which I would work with the online orders & layaway dept. Also learned fabrics cutting table ."
good,It was alright.  Some of the management was okay to work with and most of my co-workers were great to work with.  The job itself was easy and most of the customers were easy to get along with.
good,"WalMart was a more go with the flow type of job. Everyday was extremely busy and had conflict that came along with it. I learned to speak up for myself instead of getting run over by coworkers and management. The management and staff were very poor when it came to caring to their workers needs. My coworkers were positive, caring, and supportive non the less. But it was made me feel like I was working myself for no reason. Some days were exhausting and some days were energizing. The hardest part was getting through the day itself. But what made me stay at the job was that I learned more and experienced more about customer service. knowledgeable"
good,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with upper management who are spiteful. Who rather over use power than provide support to their employees. It's also very stressful with very many demands. Hours get cut severely, but you can still be expected to work overtime that you have to cut later."
good,"A day in the life of walmart for me is moving from location to location as needed. If they need a merchandiser, any kind of sales associate, reclamation clerk, receiving clerk, cashier, semi knowledgeable CSM, pick-up-today or site-to-store associate; they call me. I am always happy to help in any way I can. People often ask me questions they don't know the answer to, because 8 times out of 10 I will know the answer."
good,"Pretty easy job, managers weren't the best, and of course, the pay could have been better. It's a good job for someone in high school or college."
good,"It was my first job. I was a stay at home mom for 7 years and I never had a job before or had any experience. When I first started working for Walmart it was good at first than they started to change things around and management went down hill. I was in apparel so I basically learned how to zone, stocking shelves, and taking care of customers. Which for me I am a very shy person and the job helped me a lot to be more less shy. I actually enjoyed what I did I learned about barcodes, upcs, and learning people/communication skills."
good,"My department was only busy in certain seasons so my day was spent mostly cleaning, zoning and restocking.  Occasionally i assisted in other departments."
good,Management could be a little more understanding.  And the pay could be a little better.  I have no big complaints about this company.  I would work for Walmart again.
good,"The main reason I loved working at Walmart was for the people I worked with and sometimes the customers. I was not overly happy with going to work, I dreaded dealing with the management. The only part about that job that I considered great was the people you see everyday that makes you feel like family. Working for Walmart meant you were always under staffed and no matter how hard you tried what you did wasn't good enough for management. Aside from poor management and leadership the environment was very family like and I loved that."
good,"I have learned to work with other people from different departments for a common goal. Additionally, I have learned to get my assignments done in a speculated time."
good,"Management team are horrible. Only perks is that every job position there is trainable, no skills require."
good,Fast paced always busy put away freight help customers frequently other co workers are decent Walmart has awesome benefits works well with my schedule.
good,"Constant engagement with costumers, learned how to help as much as possible and was as polite and respectful as i could. Had daily costumers that mutually enjoyed each others company. The work site was uncomfortable at times, no one wanted to engage with each other or create a necessary friendship. Being at the cash register, and constantly standing for eight hours was never a bother. i enjoyed seeing costumers enjoy how fact paced i was and connected i would be with their small talk."
good,"Walmart need more organization, everything was out of place and no one knew what to do. You could call a manager over and in about 20 minutes they would finally show up, most shifts are 8 hours and there would be some days where you wouldn't get a break, the store was always dirty. Customers would always complain that management wasn't good, and that they could never complain to a manager because they couldn't find one. the store was always short on staff. Other Walmart locations might be better but not the one I worked at."
good,"Enjoyed the team members good opportunity for advancement, decent pay for area great transfer opportunities. good place to work"
good,A bit too gossipy of an environment for my tastes. The scheduling was also unpredictable but there were mechanisms in place for adjustments.
good,the management at walmart are horrible. a typical day at walmart is tiring.i hated working there but the pay was good. im happy I parted ways with this company
good,"No work life balance, more like a work-work balance. Leadership has a de-centralized message. Very big gaps in communication."
good,"They pay much better than other similar jobs, but if you needed a day off, forget it. I missed my grandmother's funeral because they wouldn't let me have the day off. I quit because of this."
good,"My typical day at work was always predictable. I was always busy but I didn't mind. I was a cashier but was always outside being a cart pusher, customer service, or restocking shelves. I learned how to work different technology devices and registers such as customer service with money grams, returns, exchanges, refunds etc. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers throughout the day specially if i am training a new employee. The hardest part of my job was basically pushing carts in 98 degree weather without a break but I was able to manage. Management was not so great, breaks were not giving out on time sometimes I go to lunch maybe a hour or two late, or when I need assistance from a manager they are no where to be found and it will take me a couple of minutes to find them."
good,"there was too much drama and favoritism. every walmart is different but the one i was at had a lot of compicatioms.you can have some good days, then u can have some bad days. the employees in the store kept up a lot of drama and talked about you behind your back. for a company that says teamwork makes the dreamwork, there were hardly any teamwork. the area i worked in was hectic at times because certain days there were a lot of customers, but we managed to get along."
good,"It's okay. There's a need to be very specific about your availability. Saying it's open means one day you're working until midnight and then coming in the next day at 7 am. Waiting for assistance at the register is a pain and can take longer than it should. Sometimes you don't get one (or any) of your breaks and only get your lunch. Sometimes you get locked out of your register before you get sent to lunch. Definitely not ideal for long term employment, but fine for a temporary situation."
good,Walmart is fast pace environment that requires allot of energy and patience.   Great employment for those starting off or looking for a second job or career.
good,"Dealing with the customers is a joy to someone who likes people.  Trying to get breaks is another thing all  together.  Being busy all the time is great. making sure your ""punches"" on the time clock are correct can be difficult."
good,"A typical day at work was me working alone for anywhere between 2.5-7 hours at the service desk. I was expected to help every customer efficiently and effectively follow policy while doing so, as well as keep the desk area clean and organized and sort all return merchandise as it came in. I learned to multitask and to perform my job very well. Management was tough on all of us but I understood their intentions. Did not always work with us when we needed something, though. My co-workers are family to me! I could not have survived this job without them."
good,"I loved my job, but, the people in charge were not good leaders. My manager was a inconsiderate thief. I feel all management should be replaced there."
good,"You work every holiday, crazy shifts, and breaks are always late. They don't care if your going to school, have families, or another job. You make minimum wage  and expect to go nowhere in the company. I never got out on time to get to my classes or children from daycare. I would work mostly a half hour over my scheduled time but they make sure you never get close to 40 hours. Breaks and lunches would be half hour or hours late."
good,It is the same place but Walmart was easier to work for. It was easier to communicate with management and co-workers. Management was more accessible and easier to reach by phone.
good,It's a job some places are better than others if you get along with people you'll be fine. Some people are easier to get along with than others pros and cons just like everywhere you work.
good,the managers were very insensitive to the employees lives.i learrned alot of things on my own. I got alot better at time management because i was given mutiple tasks to omplete during my shiift
good,"They set unrealistic daily goals for the time allotted, and if anyone in that section doesn't finish, which was usually everyone, everyone gets a reprimand. After so many reprimands you get terminated. Not even middle management is safe. "
good,Wal-Mart was a very stressful sometimes okay place to work I have learned that you have to have patience working there the management was horrible they never got nothing done my co workers was okay until they didn't do what they needed to do the hardest part of the job was learning everything on your own  the most enjoyable part of the job was serving costumer's and making them smile
good,"Typical day consists of cleaning up the cooler in preparation for arrival of that days new truck. Making sure the shelves are stocked with all  standard Dairy products ie. Milk Juice Eggs Cheese Yogurt etc. "
good,"I feel bad for the uneducated parents who have to endure Walmart's management just so they can have a roof over their heads. I'm going to college and im going to pray it's the successful care free sufficient economical path to happiness. In sort Walmart was like a zoo. I gazed at my employees from the side lines in sorrow. Im not trying to discourage anyone from working there but for me it was just... sad. Just in case any potential manager see's this, I'm going to save up for college for at least a year in a half so i won't be flaking on a short notice, i intend to do right by the company i serve."
good,"There is always something to do, unload trucks, work on cars, ringing up customers. making friends. co workers are always there to talk to. sometimes under staffed."
good,"It's an ok place to work, it was just to far to travel in order to get there. The pay isn't great but it's manageable. A typical day for me at Walmart starts before I even arrive because it's takes an hour an a half to get there. On the weekends you have to take a 25 min. walk for willow grove mall to the Walmart because buses don't run on weekends."
good,"For starters, I've enjoyed working in electronics while I was there. I knew about 75% of the products we had on our shelves. The reason I say that is because the Walmart I worked at didn't have some kind of system to look up what kind of movies or games we had on our shelves. "
good,When I first started at Wal-Mart it was fun but over the years and management changed I just feel like they're asking us to do other jobs that are meant for other shifts or management.
good,"Working at Walmart was very laid back, however, when it got busy it was intense. Customer service managers had their favorites, and so it became pretty unfair sometimes."
good,My typical day at work would be coming in to greet the customers as they come and assist them with anything that they need.
good,Poor management decision on running the stores caused many problems such as favoritism and unfinished task throughout the day.Some people are working hard while others will be walking around and not getting coached for doing nothing.
good,"I learned to manage a department, and how to help customers with their needs, how to complete tasks on time. Worked with some great co-workers who taught me some great skills to get my job done efficiently. The most enjoyable part of working here is being able to help a customer with their needs and knowing they are greatful for the help."
good,"This is my first job since I got here in California, nothing to complain about. They already have a concrete plan of success and advancement, opportunities and system. But in my age and experience I will need a more suitable and stable job for myself to start my career here in California."
good,The structure of NC facility differed from TN. More structure in NC. Much more of a  relaxed atmosphere in NC. Very few associates seemed to be please at this facility in TN. Not much of associates teamwork here.
good,"You know the routine..Be on time, make sure your stats are in line with expectations. Don't be accused of saying something wrong. Global ethics will fire you after doing a phony investigation. You are just a number in this strict call center environment."
good,"I am a department manager,  the company has specific processes that are the upmost importance.  however the management doesn't seem to think the corporate process is needed in our store.  the job itself is enjoyable however the pay and benefits are not the best"
good,"Start at 6:30am"
good,I had a bad experience both times working here because of the management not allowing me to get done with my job and taking care of the customer. it's good if your a college student great place to work
good,Je suis rentré au Wal-Mart lors de sa construction donc nous devions placer tout le magasin et les articles.
good,"Overall I can stay positive in any situation of my environment. "
good,"I did my very best and it paid. That was the basis of my work experience there. To me it was simply a job and I needed money. It's not a place I recommend working, unless you simply need the experience. I got plenty of experience working there."
good,I Love My Job At Walmart But The Pay Sucks. i Get Paid As Much As A Cashier To Do Twice The Work Dont Get Me Wrong I Love The People I Work With But I Can't Handle The Pay
good,"I appreciate that we each have a routine which leads to progress and success at the end of the day.  "
good,"It is an alright place to start, but as you advance in the company it gets more stressful, with very little pay increase. I enjoyed my time there for the most part, but the management have some power trip issues."
good,"Worked in the toy department helping customer and stocking shelves. I am sure over the years working for Walmart has improved, but when I worked there I was overworked and underpaid. Between working toys covering sporting goods, lawn and garden, pets and cashier I was pulled in too many directions."
good,"Upbeat and flexible who is highly energetic, outgoing, and detail orientated. Handles multiple responsibilities simultaneously while providing exceptional customer service. Driven and results focused with expertise in multiple restaurant roles, customer service, and cash handling background."
good,"Foi uma empresa em que passei muito tempo de minha vida,me dediquei e cresci muito com ela, embora as pessoas não davam o valor aos seus funcionários."
good,"Typical day at Walmart busy, productive"
good,"Wal mart wasn't a terrible job, but the managers are unfair and not trustworthy. My day started out with me doing managers job and getting in trouble for not being able to finish my own when new crew clocked in"
good,Work is long early and hard on your back with little pay and constant disrespect with no room to actually move up unless you're a very inconsiderate person.
good,"Very unprofessional, doesn't pay according to experience and co workers always getting into it and calling out. Unorganized scheduling."
good,Empresa proporciona liberdade ao aprendiz de trabalhar em diversoso setores a adquirir experiencia.
good,"My review is , I have learned a lot about price accuracy, new skills including inventory control, I provide great customer service. Management there is not very good, there is a lot of favortism within the management. The hardest part is not being able to move up in the company because of the favortism there. The most enjoyable part is with the customers and interacting with my co workers."
good,confirming the products that come into the store and scanning them in with a telxon gun and making sure the counts are correct
good,I worked at Walmart for several months. The only thing i learned from that experience is to go to work and perform well and to work to best of your ability. Management was unorganized.
good,some of the people I worked with were nice. but we couldn't have any overtime. I didn't like it but it was a job and it got the bills paid.
good,"its an okay place to work at, not ideal. as part of cap team 2 we unload all the merchandise that comes to the store and put it on pallets . at the end of the night we pull all the freight to the floor for the night shift to stock. when we unload trucks faster than usual they make us go stock the shelves."
good,"Es una empresa enorme que brinda cultura entre sus trabajadores y lideres , buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,"Good working relationship with managers. Time spent on the job was very productive, always on the move, either helping customers with price checks, or product details. significant amount of time stocking the shelves, inventory of stock, stocking both indoor shelves and outdoors garden stock."
good,"Good benefits, to much friendship/hanging out between management and associates so its very hard to move up because the more higher positions and full time positions are always given to their friends."
good,"For the most part this is a typical minimum wage establishment for entry level workers. Generally there isn't much room for advancement, and there are only a few different areas you can work in."
good,"The morale of many associates could be lifted if the members of management, all levels, would acknowledge the associates for their hard work. The majority of the time, management only acknowledges the skills that the employees are lacking in.  When management is on the associates side, the associates tend to to perform better."
good,This company is great to work for because of its flexibility in shifts and the overtime hours that are offered. A typical workday for me varies because it depends on what job they have me listed to do that day.This job gives me the opportunity to meet all types of different people from different backgrounds.
good,"Helping others. Being a quicker learner. Satisfied customers to the best I can, going that extra miles. Greeting customer to the best of my acknowledge."
good,"As a greeter, I liked the busy cycle of customers coming in and leaving. Most of the customers were polite as they entered. The amount of fun was relative to the amount of people who were pleasant as I greeted them. I learned that you have to be understanding and a quick reader of people so you can great them appropriately."
good,The Walmart Company is the best company if you want start working in US. they have a good Customer service and you can see a lot of people with different Culture. They management team work hard but always Walmart has a better customer service than Employees service. They like pay to customer more than Employees.
good,"-very crowded space in back"
good,"The management needs a lot of work on their communication and the way they treat coworkers. Some are disrespect and talk down to coworkers. Since, they have a higher position they feels that they are better and can do what they want and treat workers anyway they want. Some workers feel like they don't have any help or anyone to talk that are on their side."
good,"It was not a good working environment. There was always a lot of confusion due to lack of communication. If you worked 6 hours without clocking out for a lunch you would get written up. That was a difficult task almost everyday. There would be co-workers on lunch/break/called in and you would have a line of customers, with no backup. I couldn't and wouldn't just walk away, much like others and then we would get in trouble. It was very discouraging."
good,"i really didn't particularly enjoy the experience, but it wasn't unbearable. i did mindless work and got paid, not much stress."
good,You learn every department and they never give you the chance to prove it ..I learn a lot from walmart but its hard to  make to a better level
good,"Working at Walmart was very easy. I didn't learn much to be completely honest. I enjoyed the option of 30 minute to 1 hour lunches. Co-workers were awesome. Management was regular. Hardest part was working for 8.00 a hour, which is why I resigned and found a better paying job."
good,"Its an all right job, if management would be better and actually care about their employees then maybe it would be better. I want to move up in the company right, not brown nosing like everyone else. But apparently working my butt off isn't the way to go. So unless something changes Wal-Mart is about to lose a very good employee."
good,"Walmart has great job culture, but there really isn't no room for advancement. The hours changed frequently, which wasn't a problem ."
good,"clean working enviroment, most managers are nice and team helpers. i learned how to stock and do inventory. fast paced,"
good,"Lo que mas me gusto del empleo anterior, fue que conocí como se trabaja en una tienda departamental porque es muy interesante."
good,Stripe and waxing of floors. Daily scrubbing and buffing of store. Maintaining and upkeep of equipment. Maintenance and general cleaning of store and back rooms.
good,"I spend my day improving sales, customer service, and improving the department. I learned how to manage my time and my team. I really enjoy the people I help and my employees that help me improve in stock. The hardest part about my job is its the biggest department in the store and the most shopped."
good,"The job was not difficult. The management was decent, they definitely helped me when I had questions. It was a good starter job for someone, either in college or high school."
good,"Good busy"
good,Walmart has changed alot since the takeover/ I learned great customer service skills at walmart/I loved my customers/real /ly had a great working relationship/managers were akways willing to help you in any way could y\to improve your work skills
good,"enjoyable to be creative with your work"
good,Very hard job but it was good for me to survive in Canada. My assistant manager in night shift  was not able to manage workers.
good,"While Walmart has gained strength in their benefits package, and competitive pay, the company has put aside customer service, and HR management needs."
good,I was always fearing for my job if i had done something even slightly incorrectly. Only work here if you know how to work the system and essentially you can move up to manager with a year.
good,"Different projects everyday which were kind of interesting. Management could've been better, but tolerable. The best part was clocking out."
good,"As an assistant manager, I learned how to multitask, and manage up to 50 employees on one shift.  I also learned how to do store tours to look for opportunities to bring to my management team, and to communicate to my employees in our store meeting each day. Other responsibilities such as scheduling and employee evaluation, were day to day tasks with this position."
good,Most--if not all-- managers in the store did not understand basic business tactics. Many of them did not appear to possess any knowledge of how to treat an employee with respect and with dignity.
good,For students its a great place to get your feet wet. I do not recommend for long term as the core structure of the corporation does not support this endeavor
good,"I enjoyed working there with co-workers and I was able to have an experience at Walmart. I learned how to interactive with the customers, cutting the bread, stocking, baking bread, cleaning, and etc."
good,"Its not that great of a place to work. you get good hours and good pay, just not enough credit for the work you do."
good,"starting at 4 am for bakers prepare donuts, frost, ice, mark downs, throw aways, inventory, prepare next days forecast for baking"
good,the work was great so were the people but they laid us off 2 days before the xmas holiday without notice
good,"the people you will work with are great people but there really is no chances in advancement and it takes you over a year to get benefits that really don't have you covered for much "
good,They are a good place to work to get you through to something better. They are making changes within the store to make it a better place to work. I love working in the sporting goods department. I am a country girl and love the outdoors. Customers have given great feedback of my knowledge and customer service skills. My co workers right now are new to the department and daily tasks can be a little frustrating to get done but I get it done. What I love the most about my job right now is the customer service part of it. Meeting new people and helping people learn a little about the outdoors brings a smile to my face.
good,the company needs serious managers. their rules and standards are highly ridiculous and foolish when it comes to the attendance policy.
good,son cosas cosas buenas las que tiene este empresa pero tambien se puede batallar con los gerentes hasta con tu jefe directo pss ellos  cuando nesecitas apoyo a ellos no te lo dan en cambio si ellos te piden no reciben un no como respuesta es muy negrera esta empresa la verdad y no se dija cuando te liquidan liquidan de lo peor y igual sus prestaciones son de lo peor no son buenas no las respetan tan solo por ser una empresa estadounidense no es buena que dijamos
good,Work and go home...Co-workers are alright...Management is horrible...Keep corporate's number in your pocket at all times...
good,"Very easy job, not hard to stay busy unless it's an slow day with no customers. I learned how to handle customers better, I became more of an people's person."
good,Management acks organization and little invective for opportunities to move up the career ladder. Commutation is poor among associates and management. Company polices are very vague and management lack flexibility.
good,"The job is okay if you are just trying to make money, finish school and move on to better. The managers were incompetent and never really helped out the workers. Co workers were ok"
good,"A typical day included finding what are duties was for that day and completing them.  I learned a lot about how things are done and what it takes to keep things orderly and clean.  The managers were helpful, knowledgeable and willing to work with us. My co-workers were friendly and willing to help each other to get the job finished.  The hardest part of the job was the bending and lifting.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the results my work and socializing with the people."
good,Management was poor and highly disrespectful. Learned that I'm good at working in a fast pace. Most enjoyable part of working at Walmart is all the smiles I got to see on a daily basis.
good,"Work can be hectic from to day to day,but it can be fun on certain days of the week. Very fast past and always assisting our customers to the best we can. On some cases, there are trouble with moving on up on positions you might desire or not enough hours for the department to move in to. Breaks and lunches are steady every two hours, unfortunately, it is poorly managed on the weekends or if understaffed on a particular day."
good,"No overtime, with a high turnaround rate in employees. feels as though management only cares about safety when auditor is around."
good,There was never enough work to do without having to find something to do to stay busy. The supervisor played favorites with one of the other associates. Everyone would take more breaks then they were allotted and would stay gone from the work area for as long as possible. Management never responded to this problem.
good,"Al iniciar la jornada laboral en cualquiera de los 3 turno (Mañana, Tarde o Noche) revisamos correos o si encontramo a nuestros compañeros quienes nos informaban de lo relevantes de su turno y si ellos habian dejado algo pendiente por concluir referente a la operacion en concreto tareas administrativas, se inicia el turno con una junta  con el equipo de cada area reforzando temas relevantes y estableciendo los objetivos del area. "
good,"Nights went by fast, learned more about time management. Enjoy working with co-workers many had been there for years so I was able to learn faster with advice taken from them. Hardest part of the job was based on how many pallets were given to you nightly. Most enjoyable learning more about myself in a different work environment. Also meeting new people and learning from them."
good,"My day usually started with me finding the keys that I needed for sporting goods and hardware. I would seek out my department manager to see what's new, or what information or job he/she wanted me to do? I enjoyed interacting with fellow co-workers, and enjoyed servicing the customers. Management wasn't to accessible or kind to the employees and customers. They were very unprofessional and rude at times. Despite the uneasy working environment I tried to stay positive and continue to provide excellent customer service."
good,"Uma Empresa onde o Ambiente de trabalho era sempre tranquilo. Aprendi a trabalhar com organização de arquivos, separação de notas e arquivos de notas fiscais."
good,It was alright. Working there was really boring though and the supervisor was rude to everyone in my department. Wage isn't good either.
good,Walmart being such a big company doesn't provide the keys you need as an associate to grow in the company. security for employees is horrible in this place. Customer will always be right no matter what the situation is. you see a lot of employees come and go.
good,"I've worked with Wal-Mart for 16 years. As long as you do what your told and don't try to go too far above and beyond you may be able to advance if you know the right people. Fantastic vision coverage for insurance if you work full time. Overtime is treated as insubordination. If you have even a minute of overtime they have you cut it by taking a long lunch or clocking in later on next day of business. The sick policy is disgusting. You could have a presidential pardon for the day you were out and it would STILL be considered unexcused. The management temperament varies from person to person and you often find people being treated differently if their manager doesn't like them. The hardest part was finding the balance between ingenuity, voicing ideas that may make a project better and keeping to what your manager likes. Favoritism is high. My coworkers were almost always fantastic people who were a joy to work with. I loved having the opportunity to help people. Helping people get what they need to improve their lives gives me the warmest feeling in my heart. Wal-Mart allowed me to experience that and learn the best ways to help them with what they could give me in training, resources, and customer service."
good,"Although noted as a great place to work with very flexible abilities, the fact is that you are over worked and expected to work above and beyond for little to no recognition day after day."
good,"This was my first job, and I ended up working there for a long time out of comfort. However, the only thing I really enjoyed at this job was my coworkers, as the job it self was often bogged down with over-regulating or bad management choices"
good,"Es una empresa que proporciona un equilibrio entre lo laboral y  la parte familiar, ya que inculcaba mantener un ambiente familiar, ademas que te desenvuelves por el contacto que tienes con proveedores, promotores, etc. Permite desemvolverte laboral."
good,"I enjoy working at Wal-Mart, but management like to talk trash about the other employees. I was hired as a DELI Associate, and am now being forced to work in the Bakery. I did not receive any training in the Bakery and was basically told to figure it out myself. My department manager doesn't do much, besides sit around and talk trash to our Fresh Items Manager. The pay is nice, and I love working in the Deli, just hate being treated bad."
good,Their management are very undertrained and very horrible at taking care of its employees. You request off for a year in advance for something that is important and they wont even look at it till a week in advance and then tell you oh they didnt have enough to schedule down.
good,"This was my first job and I found that it was super understanding about that, as long as you are there on time, try your best, and follow general company policies, you'll be fine. The problem is that Walmart is changing for the worse. There are two kinds of employees there now: Those that are stuck because either it's all they know or they've been there so long the benefits are too good. And those that can't get a job anywhere else. Great for gaining experience, but there are people there who don't care. Who hate the work, and pile it on to people who do get it done. The managers pressure the people they know will care, so good people get extra work and pressure while the slackers get excuses made for them."
good,Wal-Mart is a good company to work with. It is a very secure work place. You have plenty of opportunity for advancement. You will spend time working with a very diverse group of people and that is great. Your success depends soley on how your store manager feels about you. you are not graded and promoted off of you work ethic.
good,"It was a fun environment but they treated their employees badly, so many things to stock and no one helps. the freezers are really cold and they dont provide you with sweater."
good,"Worked for a few years and spent time interacting with guests.  My peers were continually promoted around me, but I wasn't due to productivity overnight with stocking the shelves.  Every annual review received the highest rating, but they have preset amounts of money you can receive.  "
good,"this was not the job for me ,there was not many safety systems in place to make the job feel safe and overall there was no structure"
good,A job to get buy because there is no loyalty there's always someone trying to take your place its a company that you don't want to grow with.
good,always looking for a reason to write an employ up. Hard to take time off. Does not have an open door policy. On a positive note most other emploees are amazing people and great co-workers.
good,I did enjoy the many positions so theres always something new to learn. working with customer was a pleasure for me. I worked all over the store.
good,The management was unorganized and often times unapproachable due to their unfriendly personalities. The employees were often the best part of the job.
good,"A fun productive day at the workplace  for me is when my co-workers tends to  show me a good time while we'r at work, making the time go by faster."
good,This job is great if you only want a part-time job. It is a great place to learn the necessary skills needed for the next job to come.
good,"Pros"
good,Work was sometimes hard but you learn to cope and get along with your co-workers.  They sometimes have your back when in a jam and  help knowing that they too need help at times. Management is there when needed and tries to put all of us in the best area that needs extra workers.  Down stacking our freight and making sure any other dept. items go over to section.   We find time to show pictures and talk about other than work.
good,"A typical day included helping customers find what they need or carrying groceries to their vehicles. I learned how to be more personable and how to strike up a conversation with someone; who seems to be in need of something but can't seem to bring themselves to ask."
good,"la relacion laboral es estable y los sueldos accesibles"
good,The only thing that I didn't like was the communication between staff members. I feel that it is important to have a strong work bond between your fellow employees.
good,Not a good company too many rules. I've learned a lot through my 8 months how to deal with customers and be strong. But relatively we've got no good workers who wanna do their jobs.
good,I was on till all day every day and it was alright but most of the people were older and did not work very hard so it got annoying
good,"FAST PACED and fun environment, learned how to deal with difficult customers. Managers were hardly there. I learned alot there, great coworkers"
good,"Not many people who work for this company really care about what they do, some managers are terrible as some to some are amazing the store manager great guys really try to help you out the best he can. If you work at Walmart is best to do your job and not hang out with your co workers outside after work hours, some of the employees are terrible worst than a high school."
good,"This job is only good for a temporary period of time, Unless you have someone you know on the in side. They promote people who don't deserve it and treat their best employees poorly."
good,"My co-workers where fun to chat with, everyone mainly worked alone. Management could have been better. Requesting a stupid amount of work to be done in such little time. The discount was good and so was the pay. Over all I would go back, as a last resort."
good,"Wal-mart is a good company in and of itself. I learned so much about economic standings and what to expect in your typical retail setting. They do give employees a discount card that they and their families can use. The most undesirable part of this job however, is the fact managment does not cooperate easily. It is very difficult to get time off or if you call out for any reason, it is counted against you, even if you have a physicians note. So many absences and your gone, no matter how good you are. Great to shop there, not so great to work."
good,"las personas se apyan mucho los gerentes no t apoyan , aprendu a trabajar en equipo, y tener respo0nsabilidades mayores a mis funciones"
good,"estresante "
good,Job workplace was not fair on their promotions. Too much favoritism shown from assistant managers. promotions given to certain individuals on regular basis.
good,"very easy to loose your job , new policies makes new hires feel like just churn and burn temps. and the training way very bad"
good,I would come in usually they would have me unload the freight trucks after that i would just stock shelves for the rest of the day but the managers hardly talked to each other so one of them would tell you to do something that you typically wouldn't have to then the other managers would get mad because you weren't doing the task originally assigned to you and if you tried talking and explain to them you were pulled aside from a different manager they would get mad at you
good,Walmart is a great place to work but it has its ups and downs. Management was horrible because they were always trying to be better then other managers and they would not communicate together. They would over use there power of management title.
good,"Pulling pallets to floor, working stock to shelves."
good,I enjoyed working a Wal-mart.  I learned as much as I can from different department manager/friends. I got along good with the co-workers whom I associated.  Wal-mart open door policy can use a little work.  All in all it was a good place to work.
good,what i learned from walmart is how not to manage a team and strip them down to the point of them wanting to quit everyday. the hardest part of working there was going in when you are sick and them wanting you to stay for your whole shift. the only thing i looked forward to at work was my coworkers and some of the regular customers.
good,"co-workers are the only good thing about it, the pay wasnt very much and management isnt exactly competent  not much to say its a typical retail job"
good,"A typical day was mostly busy, understaffed, was power trained, the co workers were mostly all nice, the hardest part of the job was the unrealistic expectation of things to be done when other shifts weren't doing their jobs fully or leaving things  for the next shift to deal with. The most enjoyable part was meeting quite a few co workers who were good to get along with"
good,"Everyday you basically complete the same work you have on prior days, there is no real variety of work experience at this employer in my opinion."
good,"Great team of people to work. Work Life balance sucks , but compensation is wonderful especially for long term associates ."
good,"This company is great for teens who are looking for part-time jobs for extra cash. But for someone who is having to make a career out of this job, you may want to consider higher education. The pay is not enough for an average family to live on."
good,"Wal-Mart is very fun when it learning, they give you the opportunity to cross-train, you have an idea of almost every department."
good,"Working as a cashier at Wal-mart can be pleasant, as interacting with customers can be very fun and interesting.  My customers tend to return to me because they appreciate my kindness, efficiency and willingness to help.  I enjoy making the end of shopping experience quick and stress-free.  The hardest part of the job is that it is physically very demanding.  Co-workers are supportive and easy to work with.  Management is generally supportive as well."
good,"Working here taught me discipline and to always take my job serious. I've learned new things EVERY DAY, even from my customers and it was a learning experience."
good,"Being a manager at walmart is a taxing job, it can also be very rewarding.  I worked in stores where i loved my job and I've worked in stores where my upper management was sub par and made it miserable"
good,"Customer service about sums it up when you work retail.  You can just about calm any situation with compassion and understanding when working with the public I learned with this job.  All my co-workers were amazing to work with.  The only real down fall to this job was having to give 3 weeks in advance, to request time off. Most of all I missed so many family functions.  Management was always very helpful in many situations and easy to talk to."
good,Will not ever work at Walmart again unless I absolutely have too. Managers played favorites. Impossible to switch departments unless you were one of those favorites. Those managers are no longer there though.
good,the hardest part was getting up to go to work. was never in the mood to go way to serious not enough fun people this the job for high school kids or people that's about to retire. pay sucks too
good,"Asda Walmart lives a lie of making colleagues believe they are more than just a number but unfortunately not for Management, especially middle management.   Although my time at Asda Walmart was great, I along with a number of long serving Managers were left completely disheartened after the Management Restructure that took place in 2014 and believe the Security is still lacking for Managers."
good,"Es una empresa competitiva que ayuda a toda aquella persona que tenga deseos de laborar. No importa el grado de estudios que tengas, son flexibles e incluso te brindan ayuda en cuestiones académicas."
good,great place to meet people but little to no career advancement and not so great management. on your toes at any point in time because of busy environment
good,"Tolerable yet I felt as if we as employees are expendable."
good,"In my 6 year career with Walmart I was a committed and engaged Manager.  The new direction of the company ""do more with less"" is not conducive the a decent work-life balance and it has become all about the bottom line at the cost of the Associates - cut backs to hours and promises that never come to fruition."
good,"Nothing sets Walmart apart from other huge retailers such as the Targets and KMarts of the world. It's the same tango everywhere you go. If you worked in one, you've worked in them all."
good,"In a typical day at WalMart Tire and Lube, I would change, mount and rotate tires, oil changes, clean up. I learned quite a bit about automotive work while I worked there. The management wasn't too bad, they just found reasons to gripe at you. I got a long with all of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was, keeping up with customers in a timely manner so they were satisfied and didn't have to wait for ever. The most enjoyable part of the job was, working on the cars and the my co-workers"
good,"Worked most places within the store, with the exception of upper management.  Benefits such as pay are decent if you move into Assistant manager position or higher.  Initial compensation is okay for starting out.  "
good,was horramanagment ble.. my co workers where fun too be around  the most part i liked about was the brakes they where deceint. management did not know what they where doing
good,"Management is clueless, mostly uneducated, overworked and stressed. This has to be one of the most unorganized companies I have ever worked for. I would never work for this company again!"
good,"My usual day would be busy for maybe an hour or an hour and a half, then there would be no customers for about two hours. When the commotion clams down i would clean my station or red line (draw in customers)"
good,good place if thay didn't cut hours were you lose your stuff not pay you enugh to get by on then want you to do two peoples work in short time
good,"I started at Walmart as a pharmacy cashier and within about a year moved up to pharmacy technician trainee and then certified pharmacy technician."
good,"O lugar era ruim ja por se tratar de um mercado, pessoas arrogantes, etc.."
good,This position was not hard. There is no reward for hard work and dedication. Employees are dispensable and management is very vocal to that fact.
good,Lack of training and immediate assistance. Have not be allowed to complete training due to non-sufficient time. Have requested many times to complete CBL training and have not been permitted to do so. CSM are not always available when needing customer service assistance. No set schedule. Never know what your days off will be. Cannot plan for anything wanted or needed to do on days scheduled off due to the fact that schedules are not posted more than two weeks in advance.
good,"I have worked for walmart twice. I will say that if you are in a bind and need a job quickly walmart is always the way to go. "
good,I love working at walmart because of all the people you meet on a daily basis. you always have something to do as a cashier or sales associate.
good,"Contratan gente sin experiencia, para todas las áreas, pero los jefes son de antigüedades de 15 años en adelante, pocas oportunidades para crecer, los puestos de subjefe, jefe y subgerente y gerente están muy inflados de personal"
good,"If you think working in fast food is bad, working for Walmart is terrible, good benefits, decent pay, but when it comes to the customers and management, the job is horrible"
good,"it was like working in a mad house people are very rude and the co-workers are so rude. management are not professional and never around to help customers or associate with any problems,"
good,Enjoyable at times. Typical food establishment. Great pay as a driver. Be prepared to work at dinner rush. Majority of business is done on the weekends so you have to be willing to work all weekends if you want to get hours. Advancement is limited and not much for yearly raises.
good,"good working environment , interact with a lot of people.sometimes it gets busy but they have the proper equipment to work with"
good,"typical day consists of supervising and assisting maintenance associates in all cleaning and maintenance duties"
good,"I would sign in and go straight to the cash register I was assigned to.Then my supervisor would inform me of what needs to be done at that time,if there was anything specific.My main job was to help the customers with whatever they needed and to cash them out. In between that I would water all the flowers and put away merchandise that would need to be stocked on to the shelves. I always kept my self busy doing this or just sweeping and dusting.I got along with the coworkers great. I learned that the customer is always right. I have a very friendly attitude so I didn't experience but one or two disgruntled customers and was told by management that they were like that to everyone. To be honest the hardest part of the job was the hour long lunch break. The best part of the job was meeting new people every day.And the regulars too. I looked forward to seeing my regular customers on a daily basis."
good,"We did not do much, didn't have opportunities for advancement, and did not do much critical thinking. I guess it was like any other retail store."
good,"It was a fine job. It was a lot of work but I didn't mind. The managers were alright, they treated us decent. They always expected me to stock about 4-5 sections since I was fast so that part was a little draining."
good,A typical day was to tour the store see what opportunities need to be addressed and get ready for that days truck. Best part of my job was working with all the associates and team effort most put in. The hardest part of my job was the hours and switching from days to over nights.
good,standing on feet all day enjoyed the customers very cliquie was going to work in pharmacy but got job opportunity close to home
good,"As much as I loved doing my job it was stressful. You never heard a manager thank you or compliment your hard work even during the horrid holiday season. If you were caught talking even about work management would yell and threaten a coaching. If you went to management about bullying issues with others they would not care and tell you to get over it. If you had to leave because of a medical emergency they'd count that against your attendance. It's unfortunate that I ended up hating a job that I very much enjoyed because of poor, angry management."
good,"It would start with putting out stock  in the home department , not being able t get with the home department supervisor to ask what to do with overstock. then being called up front to helpcahiers"
good,"I loved the different areas I was able to work there. The co-workers were great, and the management team was good also. I worked over night shift and I loved it, I was able to go to my kids school activities."
good,"Uma cia excelente para trabalhar,"
good,"Worked face to face with customers. Completing transactions, credit applications, and operating registers. I learned to work in a fast pace environment while completing the job correctly. Great managers with helpful criticism. Alongside fun co-workers that make u smile even on the rough days. The hardest part of the job was not being able to get a break or lunch on time. Sometimes lunch would be two-three hours late. The best part of that job was learning how to do several task while dealing with payments."
good,It has its pros and cons. It has good employees but no guaranteed hours. It is not a difficult job. Hours get cut and people get cut. Rules are always changing.
good,"Working at Walmart has it's Pros and Cons. It's not terribly taxing. The hours are decent. Most coworkers are easy to get along with in most cases. You meet a lot of nice interesting people. I've even become friends with some customers that came regularly."
good,"Atypical day is put merchandise on the shelves in an orderly fashion, working clean, fast and friendly. Learned the proper way to deal with all kinds of customers. The co-workers were varied in culture ethnicity which made work very interesting. The hardest part of the job way getting all the work completed in the time frame given which I usually did accomplish."
good,"Crisis management,High turn over no quality of life no balance example would be new store has had three new store managers in less then a year the entire asst management team has been turned over twice and all dept managers have been turned over once"
good,You have to really know what your doing pay closes attention to what you are doing so that nothing will get done wrong. It is some heavy wood so you want to loook at it
good,E uma empresa boa de trabalhar   tem refeição no local o gerente geral sempre que podia ajudava as pessoas do seu setor  quando a gente trabalhava no feriado a gente ganhava uma folga a mais na semana
good,"Walmart is not a bad place to work. Its great work experience to prepare you for a very fast paced work environment and for a  demanding employer. The coworkers are amazing, sometimes they are like family. The hardest part of the job, is that it is very physically demanding. Lots of heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are able to help someone to save money and watch them leave happy."
good,"While the day to day work was fantastic, fun, and skillful; management and overall morale was a HR nightmare. Management used anything they could (including highly unethical and unsavory methods) to increase production/efficiency. Too bad that worked poorly, if at all. Some managers were even openly racist. Which sucked because some of my very diverse coworkers were amazing at what they did, and received little to no credit for their hard work. My coworkers were generally amazing. I've made many life-long friends at Walmart. All in all for the juggernaut that WAS Walmart, the work wasn't bad. What was awful was the treatment. And the public knows this. That's why many have chosen not to shop there."
good,If it wasn't for great co worker....working for walmart was not fun at all. There are few member of management that will treat employees with respect but for the most part they will really put you to work. It was a very learning experience working for walmart. It is really eye opener how a huge organization operates.
good,"Its not a great place to work for, but it was close by. Co-workers were good, management set unrealistic goals. The most enjoyable part was helping customers with their issues."
good,The company seems to only look at seniority when it comes to promotions. It does not matter how well you do your job. This then creates managers who have no business being in charge.
good,"i liked this job a lot,But i wish there were more active post.The people and staff were very friendly. a good entry level security job!!"
good,Buena se aprende bastante de la poderosa logística que manejan
good,"A typical day at work all depends on the management who is working.  Management that made you feel good about yourself and the store, in return got a more productive team.  Management who was more critical and showed no appreciation of their team received a team who did not care and showed through their work."
good,"You win some- you lose some. For $9.15/hr as an overnight stocker in the freezer section it's not the best, but I didn't mind the steady work pace."
good,I didn't like working there because you are promise something at the beginning and than it never happens. There was a lot of unfairness.
good,"help assist customers on a daily basis, scan back room bins, pull freight out of the bins, deliver merchandise ton the the floor and stock and set up displays and features.."
good,"A typical Walmart day is brutal.  Working at the Customer Service Desk is very fast paced.  My shift started at 7am and most mornings I would have a line before I even had time to put money in my drawers.  I learned to keep focused on the customer in front of me, trying to give them the attention they deserve.   I completed return transactions, payroll check cashing, International money services and utility payments.  Also assisting vendors coming and going during the day.  The hardest part of the job was lack of consistent management.  The best part was making my customers happy."
good,Loved my job and interacting with customers but there was a lack of resources in order to do an effective job. Not enough cashiers and associates especially on weekends would put a strain on associates working those shifts.
good,For the time period i have worked for Wal-Mart I have noticed that the management demands much from the associates without understanding the requirements needed to get tasks done. When shifts had low staff the management would instruct associates to produce mass amounts of products in very little time without help and understanding of the process it takes to get the job done.
good,"reposição"
good,"Presidente acabou de sair do país e foi para América Central."
good,working the days shipments. learned the ins and outs of warehouse processing. did daily audits on the bins containing products. picked items for stocking crew
good,its a job that you have to be able to deal with different people every day and even then it is still very hard because a lot of customers make the job hard for you
good,"Just like any other job you have, it has ups, downs, lazy coworkers, and mean management. If you just showed up and did your job it wasn't that hard to block all of those things out, get your 8 hours in and go home."
good,"is no the best place to be because the procedure are not clear about protect the employee, the culture is a pushing one, is not about what you do, is about how much they can make from you,"
good,A very busy and fast paced work schedule. Only time we would really talk is with customers while doing carry-outs. Other than lunch breaks  with other employees. I learned that it is hard but not impossible to work in a stressful environment and the management does not full around with lazy and non-compliant employees on the work schedule. I worked pretty hard but the other employees were impressive in their duties. Working at incredible efficiency and keeping up. There were others though who failed to see what they needed to do and the urgency to do things as commanded by upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers and talking with friends who also worked at the same job.
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with.  The hours were very long.  I worked over night.  I was the only manager on overnight so usually I had no lunch break.  I worked an average of 14 hours per shift.  Many of our days off we did not get due to being short handed.  I did learn a lot and am grateful for that and the people I met and worked with.
good,"I have a degree and tried o move up a Wal-Mart just to be stopped by procedure, managers, and as well as other employees/manages a other locations."
good,"I have worked for this company since graduating from college. Being salaried pays pretty well and you are given a raise boost depending on your geographical location. I have worked for several stores and have found that the Store Manager can shape the overall store environment. More often, there are unqualified or unprofessional managers that allow toxic environments and processes to continue. "
good,i liked most of the people i worked with just not some of the rules about missing work. Their CSM would hardly listen to you
good,I spent 3 years at Walmart and only obtained a pay increase of slightly over $2/hour and that includes promoting. You are not compensated well for the work you perform.
good,"What is there to say about Walmart that hasn't been said already? Its a company that offers entry level pay for entry level positions, unless you make it into the corporate division. Jobs there are mostly jobs taken out of necessity, as most of the job culture died with its founder Sam. "
good,"A day of work at Walmart can be either great day at work or the worst day ever, it all depends on the customers,managers,and other coworkers. I've learned a lot about situation awareness,teamwork, leadership, and a small brief time at a manager. The Hardest part about working at walmart was absolutely and hundred percent dealing with rowdy customers, but in the same breath the most enjoyable thing about working in customer service is helping people and their appreciation."
good,Needs improvement on Organization and work skills. Management needs more training. Employees need to have better team work skills and understanding.
good,"I worked at walmart for not long at all due to the fact they were unable to be flexible to my schedule as a student at the time. Management was horrible and wouldnt switch my hours because it was the hours I got hired at. However I was a very quick learner, i was on cash by myself the first shift I got. I loved working cashier and I got customer compliments all the time. It's sad I had to quit."
good,Come in and report to a CSM to receive a register to report to. depending on if they were paying attention I would get breaks only sometimes. There would be days I didn't get a break when I should've. I learned that if I didn't speak up for myself then nothing would be done even if they know something should be done. Management was good at doing things but they would often have a lot on their plates so sometimes things wouldn't be done in a timely fashion but the would get done. The hardest part of the job was worrying about if I would ever get a break or not. The most enjoyable part was being able to finally sit down.
good,I am able to learn and do what I needed to do. I went from customer service to DSD receiving and I enjoy the back room. I would come in clear my door for my vendors. Then I would clean my area so my workplace was set up the right way. When UPS or FedEx come I would scan them in sign for it. Then I would scan in the product give it to the department and do my paper work.
good,The managers rarely care about you.  If there is a manager that does care about you then they are a good manager.  As long as you do your job you will not have a problem what so ever.
good,Work was easy. I would have liked for there to be more chance at advancement. It would have been nice to have higher pay as well.
good,"I learned a lot from Walmart because it was my first job, I've been loyal to the company for 3 years and have grown and have learned very department. family oriented company."
good,"Schedule changes on a weekly basis, sometimes with only 1 day's notice. Hours for part time workers are cut to offset holiday pay."
good,"•	Answered inquiries and provided information to customers "
good,"Walmart is a hard working job, I bag customer's groceries and provide them with excellent customer service. I provide them with deals and sales that we have throughout the year."
good,A typical day was great before new management. Hours got dropped and everyone start to transfer and quit. The employees were hardworkers and everyone got along well.
good,"Walmart provides good working skills and lessons that enhance your abilities as an employee. Management is sometimes questionable, alongside the coworkers, but generally, it's a good place to work."
good,The people I worked with were very enjoyable and did not lend a helping hand. I enjoyed working at Walmart as an IGS associate.
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart it was fast passed and fun.  I worked primarily nights which allowed me to have pretty much a set schedule which was nice.  Management at the Logan, UT location was self-centered and didn't care much about the people that worked under them.  This created tension at times."
good,"i never hated the people i worked with. but the company prides themselves in being nice to their employees, but they don't seem to care one bit about them."
good,"The work you do for the pay given isn't awful. You will never be overworked, but there is usually little to no chance of ever getting overtime, benefits, or advancement into upper management without putting in 8+ years."
good,"will discuss in person"
good,The time i was there was good until the change of the store manager.Alot of aspects of the job changed in the and a half years i worked there.
good,"Accurately handled transactions by operating cash register. Ran grill, popcorn maker and deep fryers. Maintain a clean and safe work environment. Stocked shelves and closed store according to procedure."
good,I learned a lot working for this company very happy I work there. Decent amount of enjoyable part of the job my personally grow and develop. This company have so much to offer
good,"Very stressful. Almost like high school especially if you are a female.I learned that no matter the salary or quality of work you do, if they can find a reason to dislike anything about you, you are doomed and will never excel. Management is only a title in Walmart, the people who hold those positions do not take it seriously. They are there for a check like most and have no real concern for each of their employees individually. Hardest part of the day was being micromanaged each working day and used because of my years with the company, knowledge and number of different stores I had worked in. I am military and worked when I was stateside in each duty station for extra income. I constantly changed pay brackets but always remained a cashier. After over 5 years of experience and getting out of the military, I was thrown into layaway and giving everyone breaks and lunches on a daily basis. I was never given opportunity to move up or into a department. I applied for many things, AP was ideal for me because of my military/security background. Other people who couldn't pass drug screens were chosen over me. When the truth came out, I was considered second but declined. I was placed at the service desk & money center for months because of shortages but never granted that position and the raise. I was told it was because of a meal violation from another state over a year ago. I found that odd that after the new year and basically running layaway by myself that a meal violation would pop up then and place a hold on me. So I began a complaint with the store manager who was brand new."
good,"I loved my job as a Training Coordinator at Walmart. The fast-paced, always busy, always adapting environment of the company suited my need for challenges and working with many different people. "
good,"Hated by the town of Beech Grove."
good,for a part time job it was ok.If things were slow in hardware I'd go to home furnishings & stock items there.Or sometimes I would end up in grocery cleaning up the area.The best part of the job was meeting people & helping them.
good,"Overall ok work, but needs management review every quarter. It was nice the first few months till some questionable managers started coming overnights and tore the team to shreds trying to get it the way they wanted."
good,"There always seem to be mixed signals among the managers. What one manager instructs you to do, another manager will reprimand you for without looking into the situation or communicating with the other manager."
good,"My experience working here was being in 30 degree conditions for 8 hours a day without the proper equipment to handle the environment on a long term basis, given 15 minute breaks every 2 hours. The management pushed employees as work horses and do what they were told without much question."
good,worked 12 hour days on a concrete floor. we were promised work through February and then less than a month later right after thanksgiving we were told we were being let go. In my opinion this lacks professionalism and honesty.
good,I would not chose to work here if I had other options simply because there is a lot of favoritism that takes place.  It is an average job that pays the bills just wanting something with better hours.
good,All I do is return and exchanges at work.  I learned that customers will basically bring back anything to Walmart.  Management in my opinion sucked because they weren't fair with everyone.  My coworkers very sort of lazy.  The hardest part about my job is dealing with customers that are already unhappy.  The most enjoyable part of my job is satisfying my customers.
good,"they expect you to work 4 different areas, and threaten you with write-ups if you don't do what they ask. no overtime and terrible pay!! they suck the life out of you"
good,great co-workers. The hardest part of the work is dealing with customers. But it can be fun sometimes having ''crazy'' customers.
good,"okay enviroment could have been better hours. other than that great company. most customers would say we were great, fast and easy going auto service place."
good,"Aprendi a trabalhar com pressão, entregar documentos em prazos e eficiência"
good,"Large work space and helpful management. Was fun working there for the short time I did. Co-workers were supportive, pushed me to do my best. Gets busy regularly."
good,Walmart is a wonderful company for gaining experience in retail as well as all the industries related to grocery retail. the company does not have a good work/life balance however.
good,"Check open work orders, start with unscheduled emergencies. I created my own work load based on emergencies  goals in my area, and reassign emergencies that I couldn't respond to within 4 hours. When work was slow I could focus on preventive maintenance goals. This company opened my skills to VFD and more supermarket equipment than I have ever been exposed to as a contractor. Walmart is always looking to improve."
good,"Always busy of a workplace, barely a moment to rest. I have learned to Multitask with proficiency. Coworkers were helpful when able to help. Hardest part of the job is Running a gun counter all alone when you have 15 customers for fishing and hunting licenses, knives sales, answering phones, completing gun sales, with customer service in other departments. The best part of the job was the customers, making sure that they are taken care of."
good,this was my first job while I was in college it helped me to pay my way through school. the people are pleasant however it is very hard to survive off pf what they pay you
good,In my first year working for Wal Mart I had a great time I was eager to learn and excited to go to work everyday. I learned so much in my first year. After the first year our store manager left he was promoted and then slowly things began to change the workers were laid off left and right and we were short staffed all the time. Though thinking that this will change and being told for a long time they were hiring more people in I stepped up to the plate and worked whenever they would need me doing any job and helping in anyway possible. Then after sometime i got worn down and could no longer keep up with the demand they had for my services and even got injured while trying to help. When i finally left my employment with Wal Mart to be honest it was a relief to me and what felt like a never ending dead end job. But to this corporation I am grateful if not for them i am not sure anyone would have given a kid like me a chance to learn anything new. I take the skills and the things i learned from this place and all the wonderful times i have had and move on to a new adventure with a new job and career.
good,it was a different environment and also fun to interact with the customers it taught me to make the customer leave with a smile and doing that little extra can go a long way.
good,dealing with customers was ok but wasn't always easy you have to try to read the customers when there walking up to you to see there mood.
good,Rang up customer products and bagged.  Gave correct change from purchases and processed credit card transactions.   I was working to help out my family finances not get help from DHS.  I enjoyed the customers that I came in contact with.
good,Heavy work load for overnight associates. Keep very busy with customers and merchandising. Must be able to handle stress and work under deadlines .
good,"A typical day, or night, starts off well but everyone ends up I sour moods by lunch when the freight gets out and some get behind... lot of blaming, finger pointing and complaining. When the freight comes out, so do the number of cardboard and pallets.  On good nights, maintenance will have 5-7 people where we can easily grab all of the cardboard pallets, and do side jobs the managers give us. But on bad nights when we only have a few people working on the team. the night goes on but the managers complain that there are still pallets out and expect us to get it done on time."
good,"Plan volume to receive, daily meeting at start of shift with all associates to express safety and other department concerns."
good,From the beginning I was left with a 15 minute training from department manager before she went on vacation. Other coworkers were always willing to step up and help teach or to perform a task with me. My fellow coworkers were like family in the end to me. Management was more like the enemy on a regular basis. Often felt they didn't care about employees and did little to assist in job duties when needed.
good,"A typical day as a cashier at Wal-Mart depend on the environment. It involved a lot of engaging with the customers and co-workers. Most of the co-workers weren't very satisfied with the job. They complained about manage quite often. Management was okay, however if your a student this isn't a place for you to work because they do not work with your schedule. Hardest part of the job would be dealing with upset customers. Most enjoyable part would meeting the customers and the diversity."
good,"Meeting people, developed better interpersonal skills, worked well with many co-workers, trying to juggle multi tasks..."
good,Overall decent place to work however being overworked a serious concern for many of my fello coworkers as well as myself
good,"A Normal day at Walmart would be the department getting together and discussing different ideas on how to benefit the company by working together on different projects in the departments. I have learned to find the loopholes in the customers complaints and wants as well as needs. When I first started when setting up the store we all worked as a team with management, after the store had open and seasonal came around managers would place their jobs in the hands of the sales associates expect us to get everything done  by the end of our shifts along with being asked to the front for cashiering when in fact not many sales associates worked. The hardest part of my job was doing everything on my own while managers would be calling me back to the office or back room or where ever for some  reason that takes me from my job or a customer. The most enjoyable parts of my job was that I made people happy and that I could make their day by just either smiling or taking time from my work to help them."
good,Somewhat of a fun place to be. Management was awful. I didn't like the Manager of the store. I did not like how things were handled most times. Pay and the hours weren't great. I did enjoy seeing and helping the customers that came in.
good,"I absolutely enjoyed working for Walmart! Great managers, benefits were pretty good. It was so stress free! Most of the customers were friendly and i enjoyed being their cashier."
good,Wal-Mart could be a great place to work. Managers are expected to lead and do the jobs of everyone else in the store. Not enough management in the stores most times to run them.
good,"I enjoy working with most of the people there, but politics and poor management are preventing me from fully enjoying working for the company."
good,"J'ai bien aimé aussi mais pas de possibilité d'avancement et n'offrant pas de temps plein , j'ai du quitter."
good,"Management not supportive of employees.  No work-life balance.  Not really flexible with hours.  The work was easy.  Enjoyed my co-workers. Felt the managers had a ""I'm better than you"" attitude."
good,"Walmart can be a good company to work for depending on who's managing. At times they are unwilling to hire people and make their associates pick up the extra slack by working in multiple departments which isn't worth the hourly wage for the associate. "
good,"A typical day at work included merchandising, staffing, delegating, and customer service, ordering, training associates, planning, "
good,"I enjoy working with Wal-Mart, especially as a maintenance employee. Each day I realize how much of an asset I really am to the company, if our facility is not clean and fixtures aren't working properly it can have a major effect of business."
good,"normal work place without supportive management . not all the numbers but how you personally grow and develop . decent amount red tape and politics , but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Typical day at work is greeting and engaging in conversations with the customers (big or small). I learned that you have to have knowledge in other departments as well (i.e. where certain items are found). Management is decent; I'm not going to sit here and pretend that it's top notch. The hardest part of the job is getting a second job. Walmart will NOT work around your work schedule. And if you adjust your availability, you won't be scheduled many shifts. What they tell me is that the reason is because there won't be any shifts available, when in actuality it's their way of showing passive aggression for not ""putting WalMart first"". Think about it. WalMart will hire any and EVERYBODY who puts that they have open availability. Also, don't be afraid to let your supervisor(s) know when they are disrespecting you. I have a few at my job who will talk to you any kind of way."
good,Meeting people within your community and also outside of your community. Feedback from customers with ideas to improve your job was very helpful. I enjoyed talking with customers who provided good comments and bad experience while shopping at Walmart. I encouraged those with bad experience to voice their concerns and I provided customer service resolutions to keep them coming back to Walmart and I thanked those who gave good comments about Walmart's role in providing good prices and products.
good,"For the most part I enjoyed working for Walmart but I just could not take it anymore.  It started out amazing, working with coworkers and having a common goal, then things started to go down hill.  Associates left and no one to fill their places, so in turn their work fell on others.  By the time I left Walmart some nights I would be the only one in several departments.  After going to management several times about it, I finally had to call it quits one night and follow my path again on getting into the IT field."
good,"All of the other associates were very friendly and nice, management and supervisors were lacking in skill and team leadership."
good,"Was a friendly place to work, but didn't quite enjoy standing in one spot for the entire working period. Some days it wasn't very organized and always fell short on staff."
good,"Walmart is a place to be if your doing nothing at all outside of work, because if you work at Walmart, that is you new home, they expect everything out of you, everyday. Walmart does not seem to care what goes on in your personal life at all."
good,"Fun place to work and great people to work with. I got good hours, but not good enough pay. Managers were understanding when I needed a day off."
good,"I work for Walmart a few times in the past and boy this company was fun to work in since I like being a cashier. The only downfall was the lack of pay. I would make only $7.90hr, which is not a lot to live on if you have your own place and bills. Walmart seems like a job for those that's still in school and needing to make a little pocket change. Management was terrible! If you where not talkative and gossip a lot, you where not liked."
good,Many different tasks are performed day in and day but managers and other higher ups will belittle employees depending on the task they did.
good,"If your looking to just have a job this is the place. If you're looking to advance, you better be in good with the management. Experience doesn't matter."
good,"As a day light cashier it was enjoyable and not a lot of stress. The CSM  are very nice and easy to get along with."
good,I felt that management was always finding reasons to pick at you and that is why they have a high turnover of management.  They always found things wrong with your work but never praised the good work I did.
good,work hard low pay no good management would not recommend this company to know body i wish i could say something different but i cant
good,"Aprendi que tudo pode ser possível , a maioria dos colegas eram amigasveis."
good,It's pretty much what you'd expect. Decent people in middle management but horrible upper management. Great coworkers and flexible hours.
good,"Good co-workers, hardest part was trying to cover more than a place at a time if the store is super busy. Most enjoyable part was that I loved to work in sports and toys."
good,Great opportunity for a career with the right management and employees but fun place to work. Lots of room for opportunity and growth in all available positions. Certain work nights are challenging but I manage though a lot is expected from you sometimes unexpectedly but that is part of the job and are like most jobs in the work force.
good,"The scheduling system they go by is kind of ridiculous. Some of the managers are very helpful and care about their employees while some do not. It's not easy to advance there but it's not unheard of. This place is run very much by hometown politics. So, if you're so and so's child and the manager doesn't like them then you will not be promoted."
good,"Not extremely exciting. What you would expect from a retail store. Not a huge emphasis on going above and beyond, and most of the people there do just what they need to."
good,I didn't mind working for Walmart there training program was very long mind you. I really liked working with the public and the staff. my biggest issue was the hours some weeks i was only getting one 4 hour shift and for a mother and wife it wasn't near enough.
good,Did not really care much for the rude managers because they took out their stress on the customers. I did not want to work somewhere that the employees were known to be rude to customers.
good,"I didn't really enjoy working for this company at all, the management team was really horrible. I still enjoyed working with the customers and some of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is how the management team speaks to you."
good,I learned organization skills and co- workers were fun. Management changed a lot I liked some more than others. There was no real hard part to the job you came to do a job so you did it.
good,"I didn't like my experience at Walmart. I was the the store itself but the management there was terrible. They were all about the money not the customers and workers, we could never move up in the company."
good,Change is necessary but so much has changed within the company over the past 2 years. It doesn't have the culture it once did.  Anything great that is being added you can guarantee they will pull the resources from somewhere else.
good,"Working here is fun but depends on management. Sometimes its stressful, but most of the time you can get your work done & go home, it's a paycheck."
good,A typical day at work is ok when the coworkers I enjoy are there. My main problem is them being unorganized and messing with our hours. They are very inconsiderate and careless.
good,"The pay was good, and so were the hours, but people were usually rude, and other coworkers were not dedicated, it made the job difficult and stressful. ive learned lots of customer service skills, how to deal with difficult situations. I really liked the consistent hours and the fast learning of the job."
good,"I overall enjoyed my job at Walmart. I was a cashier there and rang up customers, stocked shelves, took care of customers and was responsible for their final impression of the store. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the people I worked with. They became like my family and we got along wonderfully."
good,"Good place to work if you actually work; and management actually gives you the tools you need to work. When I worked at Wal Mart, there was ALWAYS dust and dirt, and mice."
good,Our work days are ten hour days for four days a week.  Three days off a week is really nice.  Our distribution center is currently going through a change right now.  We just got new GM and he is making a lot of changes.  We've been extremely busy and they are making all the associates work overtime.  Management isn't the best but they really don't have all the power they need.
good,"ok but dont pay enough for the job. outside job in fl. but good co workers managers are good but some dont do anything. "
good,Fast-pace environment depending on what area you work in Walmart. Decent place to work at if you're still in school and need some spending money.
good,"I liked working for Walmart, advancement is easy. The pay is decent but I do not get enough hours. Management expected for you to be good at extreme multi-tasking and always act with a sense of urgency."
good,"This company should consider giving all of there hourly employees a raise and pay for their benefits. They work their employee's too hard. One thing is for sure, if you work there for more than 3 months you're guaranteed to lose weight."
good,"the management tried to work "
good,A typical day at Walmart Walmart for me was unloadind boxes off the truck in the storage room. Then making sure the shelves were properly in order so everything was were a customer could find it. and making sure the store was clean was before I got off of work.my co-workers were all hard workers and I didn't find ant part of my job to be hard.and the most enjoyable part about my job was I worked around people so I got to meet a lot of different types of people
good,Working there for 6 months and you will see that there is no room for advancement unless you brown nose senior management. Associates who have been there for over 10 years are still in the position that they started in when joining the company.
good,"Working at Walmart may come with a plethora of stigma, but it isn't as bad as it seems. Sure the wages are nothing to write home about as an hourly worker, but due to the occasional abusive nature of customers, the worst coworkers tend to get weeded out pretty quickly. Customers, especially if you're a floor associate, can either make or break your day. Management tends to be decent with some being so-so and some being terrific. If you really put effort into it, there is always something to do. Decent job security (they're not going to fire you unless you become problematic). My summary may not be as accurate though since I have only limited experience."
good,"My experience with walmart has been great, like any other company has it good and bad, for the most part it's been a good place to meet new people and new cultures. My typical days is get to the store, clock in and go to my register unless my manager says something else. My co-workers are great people, i get along with all of them, i have learn many things with them, most important i've learn new cultures, there are people from many countries, so it is really nice to learn something new everyday. what i most enjoy about my job is that i talk to different people every day."
good,"It seemed like every other warehouse job but with good pay, benefits, and people. Management could be worked on but it was over all a good experience"
good,"A typical day starts with getting freight to the floor, stocking shelves making sure youre department is nice and tidy.From a few good members of management, i learned to merchandise and use my time wisely.coworkers were nice. hardest part of jobs was all the different directions given to me in the day. too many chiefs and not enough indians."
good,got to meet a variety of people and get to know some well. had some great management personnel. store manager and my supervisor were really nice and caring. not enough hours to really make a living though
good,They were not a bad place to work.  They had to many employees for us to get full time so we could get decent benefits thought.
good,Having the opportunity to conversate with friendly customers about our products and offers. Getting the chance to work all around the store over the time I spent in my carear.
good,When I was working at Wal-Mart it wasn't too bad. The only complaint I have is that they need to be more understanding when a woman gets pregnant.
good,"Working at Walmart over all is just okay. When first getting through the door I felt successful and happy. I could tell you this Walmart does not care for the employees we are just numbers to this company and I have quit my job due to stress. This place does not care about you being sick or personal emergencies, I think it should be against the law to schedule you within a 12 hour period ...OH WAIT IT IS ! this has happened to me over and over again...I did however have some good work days here though I couldn't imagine coming back unless I was desperate for money. There are a few  CSM ( customer service managers) that deserve 5 stars too bad half of them are no longer there"
good,"While at Walmart, I learned valuable skills of a continuous work ethic until the job was completed. My coworkers made it a fun day at work but management was tight and left no room for adjustments to how the work got done. Over all, I enjoyed my time there and learned many skills, I'm ready to take on my next journey."
good,"Managers are there to tell you what to do and always have you doing every job but your own and when you need help, there is no manager on sight."
good,fast pace work fun to work overnight honestly my second favortie job you put in the hard work an they will honnor you with respect
good,I enjoyed  having the opportunity to work with Pharmacist and other Staff. My knowledge increased in the field of pharmacy.
good,"The work wasn't always the easiest thing to do as customers can get quite temperamental, but we all stood up for each other. Management was decent. Working here i learned what i wanted to do with my life. I became close with several regular customers and we were even on a first name basis and i really enjoyed feeling like i was helping someone somehow, even if it was only giving them their prescription and a smile."
good,the most enjoyable part of the jobs when its chance to solve a technical problem and i have a chance to learn something new.
good,"Overall the company is fast growing and in need of satisfying associates needs as well as customers not just the bottom line, One shouldn't dwell on his/her personal wealth if they expect to remain the retail giant. I work with a lot of great people that are like family. Management isn't always compassionate to all needs only those favored and promotions come from favorites not knowledge.The most enjoyable part of my job is satisfying my customers needs. The hardest part is having to work short staffed on a daily basics."
good,"Empresa despreocupada de sus trabajadores y bajos Salarios y demaciado trabajo, no se entragan las herramientas adecuadas para el trabajo diario."
good,"-health benefits below industry standard for pharmacists"
good,When I was working at Walmart I like being able to be apart of a working community and helping the customers. I would go back just to be able to help the customers as much as I can.
good,a typical day would be getting to your cashier station serving customers taking a break returning and continuing to cash people out till the end of your shift
good,Not a bad place to work if you are capable of keeping your head down and staying away from all of the drama. Unfortunately management has terrible communication skills.
good,"It was always very busy. The customers was sometimes very rude, but that's anywhere. My co-workers were very lazy and slow. They didn't really want to work at all."
good,"It is a stable decent job, but you have to deal with rude customers and sometimes bad management. I didn't enjoy the random schedule, but I did like the coworkers and the easy job of stocking supplies."
good,"It's an okay job for someone starting out in the job market. It's not a good long time job. If you are someone with experience, it's not a recommended job. Your experience accounts for nothing and management will not utilize it to the store benefit. If you take any kind of cut in pay with being led to believe you will move up in the company, it's a lie. They are more into moving up people they hire in ground floor and have to train. It's a great starter job but, long term they are more of a dead end job."
good,Days consisted of long hours of standing and continuous movement. The pay rate and benefits were the best part of the job.
good,una empresa con oportunidad de crecimiento pero con salarios bajos y violaciones al derecho laboral
good,"empesa boa pena sao as pessoas...."
good,Non stop productivity....Challenging. Too many bosses and not enough workers for such a fast pace environment. Safety was an issue because there wasn't appropriate equipment to satisfy the employees needs. Needed more hands on training.
good,"This is a new thing for Walmart, when we first started working we were working for a sub contracting company then walmart decided to take over. Things went down hill from there. Walmart is not a place that is family friendly, the management looks out only for themselves. We see patients that have chronic illnesses and when we give them a Dr excuse we get backlash from management, when that should never happen, and there is patient confidentiality so there is no need to discuss what was given to the patient. If it was a doc outside of walmart would they have called to that Doc office to tell them about that Dr note. It is very political here, and there are only a handful of management that care about the associates, If you see a walmart employee unhappy that's because they really are. Just smile and tell them it will get better."
good,I don't regret earning the experience but i didn't see as a very fulfilling job.  The job was very quick passed and it was easy to fall behind but if you had a good crew you could get the job done.
good,Worked here for nine years. The work itself is not difficult. On your feet all day. The culture of the company leaves a lot to be desired. There is little development and training. Staffing is difficult.
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with higher management. After having days off you come back to a different rule change consistently. They push for you to coach associates out the door.
good,Company is changing its managers too often. It no longer is a pleasant place to work.Once you have been for a few years you no longer get raises. They have a salary cap. And because business is bad they have stopped hiring . So you have to do your job and someone else's then get in trouble for not completing your job. It used to be a good place to work but not anymore.
good,"I did not enjoy working for Wal-Mart. Some people may enjoy taking product from boxes and stocking them, but I do not. It was not a job that had any opportunity to move up. I would not work for them again. It is a good job if you are in school and need some extra money though."
good,The work is easy but the management make the job hard they stay on you about the job that you are doing assuming you don't know what you are doing also a lot of favoritism gong wth workers.
good,"the hours and pay were good most of the managers were willing and able to work with you every customer i encountered was friendly kind and usually patient. its better to be a stocker than a cashier and expect to be expected to get things done fast , cashier management could be improved"
good,It begins always had to do the same thing they taught new ways of team work and how to improve on the job .the Manages before begin they tall to you and show you what they want done first
good,I enjoyed working for walmart most of the time. enjoyed talking with people. I liked all my co workers. I liked most managers but some were not fair and did not make good decisions. the hardest part of my job was the language barrier with some customers and some csm.
good,"As an Overnight Cashier, there are many aspects to the position than just assisting customers with their purchases.  Freight delivery must be opened, broken down and stocked in all register aisles and outlying areas, such as the self-check areas.  Product must be placed in it's correct locations, neatly and in an organized manner.  Must have a pleasant personality as the interaction with many people, customers, co-workers and management is extremely diversified."
good,"stock store shelves; zone ailes make shelves neat; throw trash away."
good,"The stores goals are great, they just lack the ability to do the in a professional manner. lack of training leads to confusion and very poor customer service,"
good,"Typical day at work included stocking shelves and helping customers find what they needed."
good,"Hard working environment that takes care of their business. Not all about themselves more focused on the customers and their needs. A good place to grow and learn things you never learned before. Always a busy environment to walk upon, but its a big company and friendly associates."
good,"My typical day at work involved operating a cash register, helping customers, and organizing merchandise. I learned how to be an effective problem solver. My co-workers were always willing to help and I loved helping my co-workers as well. The hardest part of the job was the sporadic hours I worked and the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
good,"Just about every customer who vistited our store had to meet me first. Majority of the customers' loved me and how I made them feel so welcomed. I was very helpful to the customers' and I always pointed them in the right direction when I couldn't leave where I were stationed at and actually take them to exactly everything that they were looking for. The customers' would always say to me that I had much more to offer the Company than just being at the door. They would tell me that I was the friendliest to them. Never disrespected them or had an attitude towards them. They would also tell me that they would rather come to me for help than anyone else in the store."
good,"Walmart was once an excellent company to work for but the more they get away from the principles that started the company the morale goes down. A typical day consist of putting out freight, helping in other areas, checking price changes and most importantly taking care of customers. The hardest part of my job is not having the things I need to complete a task or enough time do to hours being cut, the best part of my job is the customers, its such a joy to talk to them through out the day."
good,"a bustling business with a customer service filled atmosphere. It is a service industry where the customers demands are first such as: timely and courteous check-out, cash handling with accuracy, and basically assisting the customer in whatever they need whether a carry-out, item location, price check, etc.. As a customer service representative there is so much to endure on a day at Wal-Mart, especially the very different faces of management that change every six months and every ones style is completely different. The hardest part of the job is the management change and how  available your manager is. Due to shortage of store management your manager may be spread all out through the store. Meaning if you have issues that need to be addressed it may take time.  Overall I enjoy working with the customers."
good,In my 9 years with Walmart I had my ups and downs like anyone would. I felt as if the management could have cared more about the work we did. The health care started out good but only got worse as I worked for them longer. As I worked there through the years I picked up useful skills that I think would benefit me well in other jobs.
good,"Overall  I loved the job itself especially the public contact.  I did have some issues with the treatment of some supervisors. It was a very fast paced job, sometimes to the point of hectic.  Benefits were a long time coming but were good once you got them.  I would consider employment with them again at a future date."
good,"A typical workday consisted of stress and headaches. One task demanded we have certain number of carts for sorting grocery freight, which were often in use in other sections of the store and unable to be taken to the unloading dock. On top of this our job required us to use pallet jacks frequently. While this doesn't sound like a problem in itself there were a grand total of fifteen jacks in various states of disrepair that the store obstinately refused to repair or replace, and since the use of pallet jacks was an absulote requirement in nearly all facets of backroom work throughout the store associates were often forced to steal and hide pallet jacks from one another, creating a very distrustful atmosphere and an 'Us vs Them' mentality between the different work crews."
good,Most of the CSM's was nice but management was poor and they were all unfair for the most part.most of the cashiers tried to make the day go by faster and smoother. always leading a helping hand for the most part.
good,"I was told you don't have to worry about breaks, everyone always gets there breaks. I was put a the Fuel Center and forgot about. In over 90 Days i got 4 breaks. Not enough time to walk to the store and get a bite to eat. I had to beg to get the correct items to do my job like cleaning."
good,"The management of Walmart in Winnemucca, Nevada are in desperate need of improvement in their interpersonal relations skills. my co-workers are awesome and help to make me love my job."
good,it is ok to work there. but they need to offer more hours and some kind of benefit package. but overall the enviroment is ok you do have to put in a hard days work before anyone notices anything is wrong or you need help
good,"Stocking the shelves, assisting customers, greeting customers. I learned how to read a UPC, management didn't care about employees."
good,"I worked for this company for almost four years. At the beginning, everything was great. We had enough people (cashiers anyways) in order to get our jobs done smoothly. Eventually our numbers were cut in half, yet we were still expected to do all of the work we had been doing plus more due to short staffing. I have never dealt with such incompetence as far as managers go. Not all, but most had no idea what they were doing. I don't see this store surviving much longer under it's current manager."
good,"I loved doing inventory and setting up new displays or arranging our stock so it was easy and accessible to my coworkers, especially new workers who had to learn what phone was with which company."
good,"This would be a great first job, but not something to retire from."
good,"I worked in the deli, and my typical work day would begin with frying chicken and preparing the food in the glass case. The management was good, and I liked all of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was having enough chicken during peak times like dinner and lunch. The most enjoyable part was that it was real easy."
good,"After unloading two boxed trailers with an average of four thousand boxes I am then assigned to another job task, which usually includes inventory management such as pushing freight binned in the back room to the sales floor."
good,"its a compnay thats always busy and theres always something to do. very fun place to workin and very flexible hours too.its a company where you can enhance your career,"
good,The don't pay enough for the amount of work they want out of you. The management has a non chalant attitudes. My coworkers were nice. I like the fact that we had hour breaks.
good,"well i have observed in past, that it always depends upon what kind of person is training you or who is your manager. people usually struggle at work just because of that. fortunately i have more good experience and couple of bad, and bad experience always includes managers and other employees from other departments."
good,"Walmart was a good experience for a first job, but i wouldn't want it to be made a career unless you desire to go up in management rankings. You will meet a lot of new people within the job outside and inside the faculty of Walmart. Other than that you will be overworked and pulled away from the area that you are supposed to be working under almost everyday. A lot of times upper management doesn't care much of the employees. The only reason I stayed for awhile was due to the co-workers who were friendly and understood my predicament as a college student and working 45+ hours with very little sleep. Even though it was a hard i recommend it for everyone to start here to get a feel of what it is like to start off working."
good,some days are fast and some days are slow. I learned how to work a cash register. the managers are some what lazy. my co-workers were fun and good to work with. the hardest part of the day was when there wasn't enough cash registers open and the customers complained. the most enjoyable part of the da was when it was an hour til time to get off.
good,"I just had a bad experience working here, i felt as if i didnt fit in we;; with my co workers, and management was very rude. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customersm and the most enjoyable was having your regular customers."
good,"Work  long hours, but do not get paid for it. Health insurance gone down hill. Min wage went up, but still will only pay you part-time."
good,"Handled all sales of electronics"
good,learned how to drive a forklift stock all kinds of foods and produce. I made a lot of good friends the management and co-workers was a plus. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with all the good people..
good,"I liked the work environment but, I was doing a job that had no job title and no benefits. I tried to become full time but was not made aware that Walmart only hired part time employees. A typical day at work was from 6am to 2pm I worked by myself doing the stocking and sorting of apparel for men, women, boys, girls, and infants also managing the fitting room when needed. It was nice getting to know the other associates they were kind and truthful. I did not quite agree with management most work was delegated on 3 associates on day shifts and we part time employees as of 2015 cant get benefits. I enjoyed working with other associates and overnight stocking was great experience. Over all it was a great learning experience."
good,i really feel that managment didn't care about the people that works below them. the be little us. i seriously don't like how they treated us.
good,I learned that m job is incredibly easy but it is extremely tedious. Management  will breath down your neck for a a small mistake. The work day would be awesome if management wasn't so finicky and the days weren't so hot and half of the equipment wasn't as messed up as it is. The coworkers very in terms of reliability and ability vary as well as likability. The most enjoyable part of my job is the carry outs helping out the customers and talking to them is one of my favorite things. The hardest part is working by your self and keeping three areas of carts full and happy.
good,"There are many challenges working with in this company, will not accommodate your family status.  Not much room for growth.  Very busy very hectic fast passed environment.  Not much positive feedback.  Very limited to other job opportunities.  And very strict on allowing logistics personnel to move to the corporate environment."
good,the managers treat you horrible it was just if you needed a day off they never put it im consideration for what i think sometimes they would deny it purposely to get you to call out
good,"Been trying to swithc to days from overnight but wont go through with it. advancment is hard, and overnights kills family time"
good,I loved my job while I was there but was not satisfied with me being laid off just a week after a pay raise and permanency. Would have loved to have continued with the position I was in.
good,"it is an ok place to work., decent money but treat you bad.  find some where else if you can. it is only getting worse as time goes on,"
good,Overnight at wal-mart isn't for person who's days are busy. the pay is acceptable and the management is always shifting.
good,"Wal-Mart's AP department has had an identity crisis for many years, each and every year our roles and responsibilities change and get added to and have now switched to an operations job. They continually add more work to our plate without taking anything else away and don't leave room for dealing with day to day issues in the stores. Upper management has no respect or understanding for what we go through every day and want no ""excuses"" for why you couldn't complete a newly assigned task, that includes if you were out sick, on vacation or helping cover/ assist another store with a project or internal. It's nearly impossible to become an APM in Wal-Mart now if you have an APA/ LP background in catching shoplifters. They now prefer if you have an operational or cash office/paperwork background."
good,"Wal-Mart is an okay job, depends on were you are working, you have customer's that comes in with bad attitudes and managers that's have bad temps."
good,"My typical day was receiving vendors, handling damaged items, processing paperwork, maintaining a clean and safe work place. "
good,I printed gift card messages from the sender to insert in the box with the gifts. The orders are then logged in the computer as completed and ready for shipping.
good,"Overall an ok place to work. Management was at times unorganized, and seemed underemployed. Hours were varied. Time was precious."
good,frequent layoffs and really bad management. starting pay is ok but not great. conveyance is the best job they have. all about the production and don't really care about their employees.
good,"Walmart is for the most part a good place to work, the associates I work with are great and are always there to help when its needed."
good,If left to work on equitment  the way we were trained would be great. But management was always changing procedures to suit the situation.No steady guidelines. Didnt know what was changed from day to day.
good,As a Walmart employee I was part time. When i started i figured it would be a normal part time job where you get between 15-25 hours a week however I wound up working on average 25-35 hours a week.
good,I would help unload all the trucks that came and inbetween trucks and during the rest of the time I would stock shelves till it was my time to go home.
good,short staffed with too many chief & not enough Indians. good employees quit or either was getting fired for pettiness good work employees but not enough culture or yet job security
good,"I worked for wal-mart for about 3 months, at first i loved the job, got many hours, paychecks were outragous, then after christmas holiday they cut my hours immensely. I was confused. I had asked for more hours once I saw my schedule, which consisted of only 2 days of work after about almost 2 weeks off, I had called to see about getting more hours and was told they no longer needed me, they made excuses and I spoke to more then one manager there and they all had excuses. All in all I'd have to say working for Wal-mart was an experience. And not positive, I want a job that I will be kept at for a long period of time. That I can advance in."
good,"My three years at Walmart provided me with many opportunities to gain experience in customer service and retail overall. However, I wouldn't call it a friendly workplace or an environment that encourages students who are working there to put themselves through school."
good,"The job is, in theory, simplistic. Realistically, the job is made extremely difficult by management. They tend to hinder more than help."
good,Loved the departments but health issues from a car wreck and I was told I was over qualified for the jobs. People working in these departments need to be further trained in doing their jobs. This company needs to give a lot more on hands training. Most of the associate are not alert  to what is going on in the store. or their surroundings. A lot of stealing from the employees and no one wants to report it. The Manager of the store helped me to find another job in which I could do better. Sometimes I am used to be a mystery shopper to help see how some departments of the store is doing.
good,"I really enjoyed working with all the people at walmart. my coworkers were all really cool. The only problem I had with working there was the management, they never listened, and treated us like objects. I really liked putting away freight, going into the back to get customers their product. The hardest part was at the beginning navigating my way through the store, but I learned pretty quickly of my surroundings, I learned more about how retail works, and how crazy fast paced it was, which was really fun for me."
good,This job was great because I love to work on vehicles and change the oil and fix tires. Wished it was better pay. Definitley a place not to work for benefits.
good,"It's always busy which is a good things since being busy makes the day go by faster. However, there are way to many managers to answer to."
good,"Would clock in, then had a start up meeting. After that, would hope on a lift and start the process of unloading trailers. Before the end of the shift, had to clean work area."
good,I tried working at walmart to avoid seasonal layoffs but after moving around to some of the other jobs available by them I found that it wasn't really a fit for me. I found there was little appreciation for the work that was done and a very small sense of accomplishment.
good,"I loved this job at first. It was my first job, and I was excited to start getting my own money. My co-workers and managers started off being really nice. Soon, it became unbearable to deal with, due to the fact that there was a lot of rumors and gossip circling around the work place about people. People even started to become very fake."
good,"I was excited about working for this company for one I needed a job and I love shopping at Wal-Mart. Majority of the co-workers I worked with were fun, outgoing and easy to get along with. The managers and supervisors were on key and always willing to assist you when help was needed. I learned how to assist people in a diligent manner and to do it with a smile. I must say the hardest part of this job was having to deal with customers who were I guess having a bad day and I had to remain professional and act accordingly regardless of the things that were being said to me. But to be honest the best part of the job was meeting people you never met before and them telling you that you were doing such a good job and to keep up the good work."
good,i got to listen to music while i worked and i would have to say that that was the best part about working at walmart. a typical night of working would be to stock the shelves.
good,See this Job At Walmart was only a good job because i had the best immediate supervisor and i got a lot of over time.and i was always working in the lower bay and on tires.FUN...
good,"I meet a lot of fun people there but I did not really enjoy the job, unloading trucks is hard work but the people kept me going after awhile. The management was decent but I didn't really feel comfortable with them."
good,"Our job starts at 5 am, we count money and enter the information into the computer. "
good,"easy"
good,walmart provide managers with an unique experience in which you pretty much operate as a store within a store.  It totally prepares you for all levels of management.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help others. I learned procedures for working in HR and being a Training Coordinator. I enjoyed being with my coworkers. Management was friendly and considerate. The only issue is that they don't take care of their associates.
good,"I got plenty of hours. Management often forgot about my breaks and lunches, so I would be stuck on a register until it kicked me off"
good,Call people for interviews and set them up. If hired then set up for orientation and also conducted orientation. I would take them on a tour and answer any questions and follow up with them in the weeks that they were there to see if there were any concerns or complaints and try and see if we could fix anything that they may have had an issue with. Majority of management was easy to work with. We worked as a team and they would come to me with issues in their department and I would try to find an applicant that would fit their demands. The enjoyable part was meeting the new people and learning about them. I had great co-workers. I could depend on them to help me with different tasks.
good,"I first started in the bakery and then I moved to a cashier, I got pregnant and it seemed like they showed any mercy because my feet was so swollen I had to wear slides, so I had to leave on maternity early but I was willing to work to the last minute."
good,"I just felt like you had to do so much for so little money, i feel like there's more out there for me .I want to be able to work in different positions ."
good,"Basically we started at four pm and we would take the freight off the truck and separate it which took us about an hour to three hours before lunch, after lunch we then would move the freight to the floor and get it set up for third shift."
good,"I had regular full time hours for my entire 2.5 years there.  I received benefits after 6 months of work, and had no issues with them afterwards.  It is a manual job and is hard.  You are tired and sore at the end of the day.  The managers are often unqualified for their jobs, leading to mismanagement of employees and bad treatment of employees.  Overtime is rare.  Most of the work is independent, occasionally you will share a department with other employees and all work together to stock it.  Co-workers can be helpful and supportive, though they are given little leeway by management to help other employees out.Gossip can be fairly rampant at times due to it being a small crew that works with each other consistently.  Overall, a regular-houred job that takes hard work but is predictable and easy."
good,"Learned how to work with inventory and how to use a bailer. It wasn't anything special but wasn't anything horrible. I've had to do work that should have belonged to other employees since many others are very slow and lazy, but overall still not that big of a deal."
good,"My typical day at work; Be assigned to a register/customer service desk."
good,"We ran our own truck and shipment. We put it all away as well as working customer service. Once my managers left for night, other managers took advantage and would steal coworkers not caring about electronics area needing to be covered by more than one person. The electronics department must always be covered, because it is a high value area. I got stuck with hand held going off, someone needing to do an exchange, site to store and 3 customers needing help and no one came for over 40 minutes to help. Even then they were not happy to help me. They were willing to go get the hand held item and bring it to me which if you ever did site to store I would still have to bin it in the back.  So pointless."
good,It was a tough place to work because there was not enough cashiers let alone employees therefor they were always calling other employees up to do cashier work and were not able to do work in there own department.
good,"Es una empresa dedicada a la automatización de maquinaria, su administración es familiar, apesar de ser una empresa pequeña tienen grandes clientes"
good,"In the job I had multiple things I was accountable for according to my job title, but also many other duties that were not part of my job. This aspect of working for Wal-Mart was very stressful. I felt as if I always needed an extra hand, but it was never there. "
good,Nothing special with this job. I was supposed to work in the infants department was stuck in shoes everyday putting out boxes upon boxes of shoes.
good,"Not a good place for work because more work less salary. Company is based on Whole sale Price in retail. Best Price provide every thing to his customers life style,cloths,food,electronic every thing."
good,merchandising products based on corporate and local market focus.  Learned how to prioritize and set daily goals to accomplish.  Challenge to maintain satisfaction with both associates and customers alike but can be accomplished.
good,I learned that Wal-mart was a very hard company to get in.  I learned that I probably wouldn't want another over night job.
good,"Dedicação, força de vontade, não desistir de nossos sonhos, em tudo que se faz, independente do que ou onde, só assim teremos experiência suficiente para quebrar todos os obstáculos que enfrentamos em nossas vidas."
good,busy but short staffed a lot. management is all about the money they make and the customer. coworkers I had was amazing we worked as a team and it was almost like we was family. hardest part was being short staffed when busy. the coworker comradery
good,Working with the customers was the best part of the Job. The Management team needed to learn how to deal the there employees and customer service. It was a good old boy work environment an a hostel work place at times.
good,the job at hand was fairly easy to learn and straight forward. we were trained well on how to deal with customers. We were also learned step by step so we couldn't mess up on any customer vehicles
good,A constant workload to stay busy thoughout the shift with more than enough help from willing co-workers and management.
good,"Vendors are waiting to come in at 5am. I finally find my keys and let the vendors in and unlock the dock door as well. I turn on my handheld tel-son. The vendor gives me their invoice and I type in the invoice number, total quantity and total cost of the product they are bringing in. Then I scan each item, verify the count and type in the amount. When all items are scanned I make sure the cost and quantity match the invoice. If it does I finalize it and I sign their handheld if needed or their paperwork. They will then print me off a copy of their invoice with my signature. If it doesn't match or is within the limit then the vendor has to change the cost of the items that aren't correct or take them off the invoice. Then they take their product out to the floor to fill the shelves or their product is placed in the backroom or the freezer til the merchandiser gets there to work it. I also unload walmart grocery, frozen/dairy and meat/produce trucks when they arrive during my hours. I am responsible for doing grocery, frozen and dairy reclamations and markdown claims and disposal like everyday. I write up credits for milk vendors. I make cardboard bales when needed. I use the computer to print off vendor copies, reprint receiving detail reports, enter in bales, request service such as trash disposal, store delivery look-ups, etc. I prepare food shelf donations and scan them out. I make labels for sales merchandisers. I keep the backroom clean and organized. I use hand jacks and the electric one as well to move pallets around. At the end of the day I take all my reports and match"
good,This job is really not that great if you are looking for easy advancement. Management is really hard to get along with and they manipulate the point system.
good,"I absolutely loved my co-workers, they were the best.  It could be very hard especially at the first of the month.  Very bust at this time, with Oregon Trail, but it made the day pass very quickly."
good,"As a Wal-Mart Electronic Sales Associate I held the responsibility of attending to customer’s needs & Questions!  Number one priority when it comes to maintain sales in retail. A Typical day for a sales associate is being able to locate electronic and non-electronic product within the store, also price-checking items, and organizing store shelves and displays."
good,"Big box retailer, lots of turnovers. Alot of managers are overworked and underpaid and not appreciated. The big wigs get to sit in a office and hide, and really not do much on the floor except give orders. You have alot of people who feel they are over qualified so they dont take their job to seriously. But i actually loved working there for the most part."
good,I work with some great people and have some wonderful customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing familiar faces who tell me how they love coming to see me because I am always smiling. I love working with the public. But with this company it seems that you are not appreciated at all for the things that you do. With that being said it is a job and they work with you most of the time. It is not the worst job you could have but defiantly not the best either.
good,"A typical night involved me helping an associate that could not work on their own followed by me lifting the heavy products by myself while everyone else did the little products except for a few people helping once in awhile. I would normally get my numbers sort of up but than I would get scolded for not having them up because I put away the biggest products and the consumables that needed to be put out right away, so I did not meet their quota... Most enjoyable part of the day was when I could leave. The whole time I was there I had three different managers. The hardest part was not getting mad at management for going easy on one person but not another..."
good,When I worked at the store in Bentonville the manager in the jewelry department was hard to work with and never understood my plight.
good,It's a job. It's not the best but also not the worst. Learned a lot of new people skills working there. Do not recommend unless you absolutely need a job.
good,"walmart was a steadily busy workplace, customers were great and this provided me the ability to adjust to different customers needs"
good,Coming in on a Scheduled day was actually Good and productive .. Only if your were a Dedicated hard working person. and just doing your job.
good,"I Think its a Good place to work as a student to make extra cash, although I was young I cant say much bad about the place. There where no benefits available when I was employed."
good,"over worked under paid high expectations and no reward, advancement is based on who you know not about ability, its a big box store and they squeeze as much profit as they can out of it, it can be an ok job if you don't want to brown nose your way up the latter"
good,"Walmart loss prevention was nothing I expected but I do enjoy my job."
good,I liked working there it was just the people I was working with they wasn't hard workers like I was and they always took short cuts.
good,"Muito bom de se trabalhar para quem gosta de estar diretamente em contato com o púlblico. "
good,Hard work doesn't really pay off favoritism does. Hardest part of the job is getting up for it. They drain your energy to a point you wanna quit. I only have it for now in till something better comes along that pays for the work ethic I have.
good,a lot of pressure to do the impossible production. The pay is good and the shifts are great but the stress is unbelievable. if you can handle that amount of stress then it might not be a problem. Good quarterly bonuses.
good,"It was an alright job, wish i could have gotten  more hours."
good,A manager at Walmart is a very difficult position.  It is a challenging and rewarding career if you are willing to go the extra mile.
good,The management there is horrible. There a alot of new managers that dont really understand the warehouse or how to run their departments. When there is an issue you cant really go to anyone because no one does anything about it. The hourly associates are fun to work with but i cant say the same about management.
good,"Working at Walmart wasn't too bad, but working overnights was hard while going to school as well. It took away my day life and most of my days off consisted of sleeping."
good,a typical day at work is me being put in 2-3 areas and working the. Working for this company is not bad but it is not good either. the management sucks and they work you like salves and don't get paid good.
good,Enjoyed working with general public.  Assisted with pricing and location of various items within store.  99% accuracy of cash balance to revenue sold.
good,"It is a boring job, and on overnights there is no chance for advancement especially because they will not hire any full time people at my location. I have been a part time employee for 2 years but working full time hours and there is still no word on posting a full time position. The only bonus is that you dont have to deal with customers."
good,"The typical work day at Walmart is very unpredictable, it consist of critical-thinking and problem solving abilities every hour on the job. I've gained and learned the importance of multi-tasking and time management, which is extremely important in retail, especially working for one of the biggest retailers in the world. The most difficult aspect of the job is due to the lack of support from ""internal managers, basically someone who has been with the company for decades, most will not help, nor support the growth of an external manager. It's truly a self-sufficient position, you have to learn form your mistakes and grow with each opportunity. The most enjoyable aspect of the position is the compensation."
good,Family oriented. Poor management and supervisors. Good benefits but staffing is not enough when trying to provide good customer service.
good,"Un día laborando en wal-mart..."
good,"I worked 4-8 hours a day, three times a week, and when I asked for a certain day off, Sunday, they did not respect my wishes. They also did not treat their emplooyees very well."
good,"The best part is my regulars that come in. It is nice to know that I will see smiling faces and I have come to know about their families. The worst part is not getting breaks on time, sometimes even up to 2 hours late."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart would be ensuring the assigned departments were clean and stocked for customers. It included assisting customers all around the store, not only in my assigned department. I learnt alot about customer needs at this job and the ability to be patient. My management skills were developed by picking out the negative things that were happening and bringing light upon the situations, giving me a larger perspective on how to go about things in the proper manner."
good,"It was a decent job to start and now im wanting to exapnad."
good,"If you have minimal bills and no family to support, this would be a good place to work at. The atmosphere is ok but communication amongst management to associates is lacking."
good,"Good job, easy to do, training is fast and you do the same things everyday. Fun job for anyone. You learn how to pose clients, how to edit pictures, and how to take a passport picture. Staff is friendly and always there to help."
good,"I started as a Stocker which was an extremely easy position. I then switched to IMS, which was equally easy. However due to a lack of professionalism I am now seeking employment elsewhere."
good,"Come in pull your freight out to the floor in order to rework. Stock shelves, answer phone, work a cash register. I have learned how to be more customer friendly and patient with the customers. Love my co workers. Have tons of friends. The hardest part of my job is cleaning up after others. The most enjoyable part of my job to be honest is when i get off."
good,If you are not up for physical labor this good is not for you. The management team does not care for the employees. The hardest part of the job besides the management was the rude customers.
good,"Assist and greet incoming customers, as needed.  Complete purchases, ring up customers groceries, acknowledge type of payment and give correct change when cash given."
good,Rx volume is big and they keep adding and adding and adding unrealistic expectations on Pharmacy Managers.  Staff pharmacist and floater pharmacists have it much easier
good,"Mala administracion gerencial preferencias y machismo."
good,"I have worked for Walmart for about 5 years. I can and occasionally  run three departments : Sporting goods, Automotive and Hardware. There is a general lack of respect from management. Walmart only goves benefits to full-time employees and do not hire any full-time associates except for management."
good,its a good company but the hours are never consistant and the pay is not great. but its easy to get time off when needed and the people are great to work with for the most part
good,a typical night at Wal-Mart I stocked the frozen section and brought other products to the front to be stocked management was bad worst Wal-Mart in the state most of our work was rushed with lo quality and most co workers would steal and be lazy the hardest part was making sure the frozen section looked nice and neat or Zoning the best part was leaving
good,"Love Walmart career, management, talent attracted and benefits. Continued opportunity, able to volunteer and continue working as a team. Collaboration is wonderful as well."
good,Wal-mart is a great place to work if you are looking to move up quickly in a company as long as you don't make an enemy of a immediate upper management.
good,"Tive a oportunidade de mudar minha visão de mundo, e ter uma visibilidade para novos crescimentos e novos caminhos durante o tempo que permaneci na empresa."
good,"a typical day is clock in, find a manager to see which tasks had to be accomplished for the day. after you find out what is due you balance your time accordingly with the mixture of helping customers and getting work done."
good,I worked for this company twice and the first was not the most pleasant experience but the second time around was not bad at all. They give nice hours for part time and the starter pay isn't bad.
good,"I don't rate it excellent because there was just so much overstock in the back leaving little room to work."
good,Working for Wal-Mart was because a father has to take care of his children.  I got along with co-workers but I would not work for the again.
good,Good starting point but college students. It gives you work ethic but not a great salary.  There is no room for career growth unless you are liked by someone in the higher positions
good,"Towards the end of my work experience there I feel I got along with all the managers. My department was very busy but I loved it! It was a lot of hard work but I love that too. I got along very well with all my coworkers and became a mentor to the younger set. Customer service was priority, like helping customers locate products.I also stocked products,answered the phone ,relayed messages to management, cleaned the dept,etc.I learned to be extra friendly to people, get along with others, multi- task,leadership and work hard. The hardest part of the job ,at first, was putting up with a manager who was mean to me for no reason, she falsely accused me several times but I eventually was able to win her favor! The most enjoyable part of the job was that I made lots of friends there and the fringe benefits like free food and employee discount."
good,"needing to have a positive outlook everyday from start to finish, no room for error, finding things to be fixed even out of your reach. learned how to take care of situations without needing a higher up. hard parts of the job was needing to know where supplies were and managers for questions that didn't always deal with the tasks being taken care of. lack of motivation from a lot of the employees was a little frustrating and having to take action myself."
good,"Long days filled with aggravated customers due to lack of staffing, All the co-workers were awesome and filled with humor, upper management is lazy and carefree, hardest part of the job was due to lack of staffing"
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is clocking in, going to your department and start opening up your department and in my case is Electronics. so basically seeing if anything got stolen, and helping customer with their question about their phone,new games coming out, and other electronics stuff. and what i learned was being patient with customer, because some customer will get on your nerve, coworker was good to get along with great personality."
good,"Working for Wal Mart can be exactly what you would expect, low pay, hard work and little appreciation. Wal Mart can also be a help when you are in a jam and need money quick. They almost always rehire and you already know what to expect."
good,not allowed to talk about family and never saw them.  its not a job for anyone who has a family.  at least not for a pharmacy tech.
good,"a really bad company to work for no gratification to there employees."
good,"With a big company like walmart they should have better raises but like all companies its the bottom dollar and the big bonuses in the end for the big wigs."
good,"Working at Walmart is a job, and just that! I personally found that the environment is very non professional and dramatic. The job had guaranteed a min. of 12 hours a week and max of 28 (for Part-time) however if you were a reliable employee they would try to get you come come in all the time when you are not schedule.  The hours are great for people going to school, I just personal can not handle the amount of drama that goes on at the work place. I have worked at numerous Walmart location and it seem that this is a common theme at Walmart."
good,"Walking the floor, Audits, apprehending shoplifting subjects and investigating internal cases and some days I do camera work. I learned a lot more about camera systems. Each store management team is different there's been good and bad the managers in my old store are good and my co-workers are family and are dedicated hard working people. Everyone knows retail has a slow season. The hardest part of the job is being reminded by upper management about productivity almost on a daily basis which some how in a round about way involves termination. The most enjoyable part was some of lessons I have learned from good district managers to treat everyone as equals. A mixture of new and seasoned associates in a team is a benefit and everyone learns something new everyday. Working an investigation from beginning to end and the feeling that I accomplished my goal."
good,Co-Workers are fine its just management. They act like they cant hear you when you talk to them. Hardest part is unruly customers.
good,Manegemnt is really bad. although i like the fact the job is a fast paste job. and i get along with my go-workers just fine.
good,"Buen trabajo, es muy cansado como auxiliar general, pero en lo que cabe me ayudo economicamente. Un dia tipico era recibir mercancia de los trailers, etiquetarla y emplayar tarimas, habia buen ambiente de trabajo, solo que en su momento pedi apoyo por problemas personales y no me apoyaron. Aprendi muchas cosas."
good,Love my store manager. He believed in my potential. He supported my every move. However Wal-Mart can't seem to be on one accord with its policy so customers tend to get over on everything and everybody.
good,"Management hands out impossible goals, there is little or no training except for safety.  I just do not think Walmart cares for their employees."
good,"Not always in same area that you are scheduled, hours cut often, management doesn't work well with the others because they want you to different jobs all at the same time and not enough employees scheduled . The best part of the job I meet new people each day."
good,"In my four years there I was promoted four times, it is easy for a responsible, self motivated associate to achieve a Department. Once there, getting into Salaried Manager positions is a challenge. A typical day involves interacting with three different Managers, all with different ideas about your area. I enjoyed the time there, you meet great associates and learn important retail experience.I really enjoyed helping people, and listening to different ideas."
good,Very busy. Customers are always around. I didn't learn much as I was just a stocker. Management was good and didn't mind helping with the physical work. Co-workers were great. Hardest part of the job was trying to stock while customers shopped in cramped isles. The most enjoyable part was being able to intereact with customers.
good,"Although very general, Wal-Mart gave me the training I needed in order to advance into the real world of business. It allowed me to gain knowledge of cashier training, stocking shelves, and most importantly, customer service. Management could not stress enough how important it is that the customer always comes first."
good,The job was very repetitive and most of the customers were rude to the employees.My co-workers were very nice though. The most difficult part about working at Walmart was dealing with rude customers and not being able to transfer to a full time position.
good,"I have learned that a ""happy"" worker is a ""productive"" worker. There must be a balance of work, home, and spiritual life to help maintain a productive worker. In my experience you are a leader, not a manager, of your workers. A good leader has determined employees that take ownership with what they are doing. In doing so, there is higher productivity which in drives sales and profit."
good,Wal-Mart is a company were you must have a tough skin.  Customers along with coworkers can be very challenging. a good starting point for people who have a small demand on their personal life.
good,good job for staters but salary isn't great. managers work with your school schedule most of the time. u are allowed to be off most days you resquest.
good,everything was usually very scattered an they would have me in different departments all the time. co-workers were generally very nice.
good,"I love working on the modular team, it is different every day depending on which mods need to be worked.  I have learned how to set merchandise to entice consumers and increase sales.  I love my overnight managers, and my co-workers bring different talents and aspects to their job.  Sometimes the hardest part of my job is working the overnight shift, but I enjoy the respect I get from my overnight managers because they know I know how to do my job and that I do it very well."
good,It has great managers and they really take an interest in there employes. They listened when i had a disability. They do only hire as temporary
good,"Clocking in first thing in the morning, taking the phone off of night line and going for the keys for the fitting room. Making sure that the walkie is fully charge and get ready to face the day ahead."
good,"Very fast paced, easy to grow, wonderful co workers. Management is horrible. Their are too many trying to be leaders when they don't understand what is going on. They are quick to tell you what to do but if they tell you wrong they let you take the fall. Management always backs up management and usually look at the employees like they are ignorant or just dumb teenagers. The job is not hard at all, and working with asset protection was a great adrenaline rush."
good,"Walking into the photo Lab was always something different. Spplies had to be orders, products had to be assembled. I learned more about photos and canvases I did not know before. my coworkers were great but the managment could have been better especially towards the last couple of months. The hardest part was always being short staffed, not enough people to help every customer. Helping people who did not really know how to develope pictures at our lab was enjoyable, helping people recieve great customer service was also great."
good,Constantly someone looking over your shoulder. Changes in management more than it use to. Very high stress.
good,"Helping customers is number one, daily task consist of dealing with customers, working the register, help clean the department, rotate and refill product on the shelves. help maintain backroom, answer phone calls for company, daily job was to balance serving customers with daily task from management"
good,My typical day consisted of getting up at 5:30-6:00 in the morning everyday besides weekends. Getting in a truck with no heater to drive for a half hour to an hour to get to the job sites that we undertook. Witch were usually houses. In very cold weather we would put up insulation in all the house that we were assigned. I worked for a full year for the same person never received and pay increase or any promotion what so ever.
good,"A typical day at work was to pick up after the morning's crew left, and to do what was left over. I didn't really like the job, I was in lawn and garden, and there was no a/c, and you couldn't go inside to the a/c because a customer could walk out the door, and you would get ""coached"" for it."
good,"Overall I truly enjoyed my position and the responsibilities, my co-workers became like family, and I enjoyed helping customers resolve their issues."
good,"Working overnight shifts was really strenuous on my personal life and on my health. Although the hours were difficult, it gave me customer service experience."
good,"diversity in the work force and great environment. Very productive job. require lifting, bending and standing."
good,hard work with long work hours. learned how to multi task at a fast pace. had great co-workers that made the job fun.
good,I only worked at Walmart for a couple of months so I don't have a lot to say about it. My typical day at work was stocking the lunch meat section of the store and assisting customers when they needed it. I honestly don't remember my management very much but my co-workers were fun to be around and work with. The hardest part of the job was having to go inside the very cold freezers to get more supplies to stock. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was very relaxed.
good,"Set up displays and APQs on sells floor."
good,"Okay place to work, but lacks in advancement opportunities. A typical day at Walmart is busy. What I have learned is the sit down forklift training is accomplishable. Management is somewhat attentive to employees, but lacks in customer service {example-when a customer needs to talk to a manager, it usually takes a manager 15 minutes to respond to a customer complaint}. Employees are taken for granted. Example {When an employee asks for a promotion, the response has been slow and inattentive to the employees request}."
good,Good place to work. Management and co-workers are very easy to get along with. Learned new job skills.
good,"Go to meeting get the run for the day.  Sales expectations and goals for everyone set.  Tour  floor make to do list.  Meet with Assistant manager and get notes from store tour and add  to do list,prioritize list complete list before lunch.  Help customers find what they need, give assignments to other associates.  Follow up , by second break all notes and floor should be cleaned up ready for next shift.  Management is always in movement rarely have time to do the personal time that sometimes needs to finesse their business. I learned  so many skills that I do jobs that most people wouldn't have been hired to do without a degree. My co-workers are a varied group of people,a cross section of our society with good as well as not so good workers mixed in. Hardest part of the job is not enough time to get everything done. Most enjoyable part of the day is the customer satisfaction I get with each encounter."
good,"Cooking, slicing meat and cheese. Also cleaning dishes. and helping outside my area. Help customers find items."
good,"Good people to work with but very high expectation in relation to hours, duties, and who you are. They want you to walk talk and behave the way they do. They want you to treat people like they are lower than you if you are a manager. You are held responsible for preexisting problems and dont give you enough time to fix them. You are required to work 50 hours a week and they will watch you like a hawk if you even show up late or leave early so you have no time at home. Even if you work an extra day or stay late you are expected to still work your 10 hour day and only take one day off. If you like that pace and expectations then this is the job for you."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart consisted of unloading trucks, being yelled at by managers, and pulling pallets to the sales floor"
good,"A typical day is maintaining the Pharmacy by assuring that patients get the right prescription at the right time. Along with daily inventory of drugs and supplies. Many of my co workers is what you call a ""go getter"". The pharmacy volumn is extremely high so there is never a down time moment. We do any where from 300 to 400 plus RX a day. We have a good group of team players, however with any job there is always an issue. I would like to see a more well managed Pharmacy. The Pharmacy Managers we have are somewhat new, however it seems as though it is taking them a minute to grasp to how a pharmacy to smoothly flow."
good,"i loved this job, was just having some medical issues that ended up costing me my job at the end."
good,"typical entry level job, some awesome people to work with but there's the obvious higher ups that don't treat you with respect. Hardest part was dealing with some customers and some supervisors but if you can survive that you'll go a long way."
good,This was a hard company to work for because you were expected to do everyone else's job without compensation for the extra jobs you were doing.
good,was a nice place to work not to much fun do to not enough help and the hours were not enough
good,when you really need a place to work Walmart will give you a chance.
good,"It's a company that is growing continuously, they do what's best for the company. They will not give you a hard time as long as you do your job quickly and effectively. There is always room for growth as long as you work hard for it. The only bad thing is that they rarely hire full time, to avoid giving out benefits."
good,"go to work and do my job type of environment. no one with passive for the job. just another place to get a check from. managers had there favorites and clearly showed it, which is annoying for someone who is not a butt kisser."
good,Its a repetitive job so a basically do the same job every day. but it is a very low paying job to be a multi billion dollar company and treats their employees worst than any job I ever had.
good,"The work from day to day wasn't bad but was a repeat every day, you would learn what sold the most and how you rated sales from store to store.Management at my store was mostly a joke ,co-workers were great mostly though, the hardest part was when higher up managers would come to our store and ask questions and our boss would lie because they didn't know the truth,the most enjoyable part of the day was conversing with co workers and customers."
good,I put up stock and did inventory. Assisted customers with help as far as finding what they need in the store.
good,"its busy all the time so, I'm use to working on critical moments. Co-workers are awesome and easy to work with."
good,Oversaw the employees in my department and passed down request from upper management. Unloading trucks in the general merchandise and grocery receiving areas. A lot of working with hand and heavy lifting. Keeping up with inventory.
good,Not an enjoyable place to work. Management made it very stressful. Made good tips through the satisfied customers.
good,I have enjoyed many great years with Wal-Mart but as I have 12+years in now and am not receiving the work-life balance I need to be satisfied in all aspects of my life. It does vary with many factors as most retail will but this has become the norm and is not for me any longer.
good,Had a nightly startup meeting and was told what area I would be working in for the night. Proceeded to the backroom to down stack the freight from the truck and would separate it by aisle. would then safely pull pallets out to the sales floor and start stocking the shelves with merchandise for the customers. Would answer customer questions and help them to find merchandise in other areas of the store.
good,"They are okay, they have always been there if I needed a job. The down side is that a lot of the management team does not communicate with each other and one does not know what the other is doing. The benefits quite frankly are not that great."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart is a very chandelling job, because you have some days where you have to bite your tongue because how customers think they are suppose to talk to you any kind way. You have co-workers that are two-faced like the managers and you have mangers that don't do they job as they suppose to."
good,"Cashier for a few hours, then take a break. Cashier once again andhelp customers find products or services around the store."
good,"This started out as OHL and Wal-Mart came and ended the contract they had and continued to run things themselves. I think it is pretty clear how Wal-Mart handles business when it comes to their employees, which is not very good at all. Enough said."
good,"employees are not appreciated, management over works associates and employees don't receive the pay for the amount of work put in."
good,"The job is relatively frustrating because you will be constantly moved to sections you are not assigned to, in order to help other people that aren't doing their job fast-enough. Your Co-workers can be a blast, but the management is the complete opposite. Though their intentions are good, they can be extraordinarily rough for a job that is paying you as low as it can get away with. Every day will be different, because you are not sure if you'll be doing what you were assigned to do, or someone Else's job. Though the pay is low, they do start you off with reasonable hours so the job can be great if you're looking for a second job or your first place to start; especially if you're in school. They will work with your work schedule, which can be very enjoyable."
good,man dominated place and sometime people get racist and supervisors are partial no job security if go through agency and take more than one year to get an job security then three mony=th provision period.
good,"This job is a year round job with only Christmas day closed to the public. It's a good job with high demands in a fast pace environment, hands on, customer service, and flexible hours, work all holidays except Christmas day with holiday pay. Honest strict hard working expectations. The hardest part of the job was keeping up on busy days, The easiest part of the job was keeping excellent customer service skills. Some co-workers are hard to work with but is manageable, management was poor and didn't always release employees on time for breaks which caused a lot of break violations, but workable. what I learned was that hard work pays off while poor work causes you to loose your job."
good,Just a stepping stone. None wants a career at Wal-Mart. Its just a stopping place until opportunity happens. Kinda like McDonalds.
good,"Working at Walmart the typical day I observed the day workers didn't work as hard as the overnight shift. Overnight shift employees were expected to pick up everyone's slack. We did extra work every night. While fist and second shift employees just worked without the same expectations and responsibilities.  "
good,Overall Wal-Mart is an OK place to work. Great people work there but  the pay could be a lot higher.  Customer service is a must.
good,"The walmart I was working at was unfair in certain aspects. I was pregnant working here and I was not able to use the restroon when I needed to. They would either make me wait for my break or wait 10 to 15 minutes. I did not like working here, at first i loved it and started off fun but then i started to get to know the managers and they treated me unfairly in all aspects. Not just the bathroom incidents."
good,"A typical day at work involves greeting customers, receiving cash and different forms of payments. For somebody like me who has been there 2 years maybe even get to train new cashiers. Whenever I am not so busy I will organize my aisle and make it look presentable. The hardest part of my job, is when I get a rude customer. And the most enjoyable part of my job is to be able to help customers with whatever I can. Also my co-workers make a day bearable. At the end of my day I put merchandise left at the register back it its place or take it to the front and put it in a bin."
good,"Aprendi a atender o público de todas as idades, os colegas me ensinaram o serviço, o supervisor era bem responsável e não houve nenhuma dificuldade."
good,"Not enough coverage to help with long lines."
good,Was out on Medical Leave over my back and was let go while on Medical Leave.
good,I enjoyed meeting new customers daily.  I also look forward to  assisting my returning customers that would sit and eat daily for breakfast.
good,"What I liked about my job was working with good people and ,customers. Staying busy doing odds and end or what ever I was needed to do"
good,Different types of managers. They are so busy that they don't have time for one on one time.
good,Worked as a cashier and was in charge of seasonal displays. I learned to use a new system.  The management was not nice at all.  They changed schedules with no warning
good,This job was great while in my youthful day but someone whom is trying to pay bills its not a good fit.
good,"My experience for me was good because this was my first job at the U.S.A and I learned to go around people frequently. Besides, this was my first experience as an assistant pharmacy."
good,"Its just a paycheck until I find something in my field. It's not a job I enjoy, but I am there until I get a job doing what I need to do to pay bills."
good,"Um dia tipico é aquele dia que você chega na empresa com varias tarefas e quando você ver o dia já passou e tudo feito, aprendendo que tudo vale apena e que fis minha parte no crescimento da empresa . A direção min ajudou no momento que eu precisei comigo foi bem, os colegas muitos compreensivos ajudando nos momentos mas complicados .Mas dificil é você fazer algo e não ser aproveitado o mas agradável é si em paz com sigo mesmo."
good,I enjoyed working for the establishment until other associates became dramatic over unneeded reasons. I eventually hated coming to work for the fact that it was always something terrible happening every night. I felt as if I were attending high school again.
good,"I learned to repair jewelry and watches, stock shelves, set up displays...working with products in the back, putting them on display and selling them to customers. I worked in several departments so I learned the ins and outs of hardware, apparel, jewelry, shoes and front end."
good,"* Formed close friendships with fellow employees and customers"
good,"Walmart seems to have done away with caring for employees. Full time positions have been eliminated, and the healthcare is terrible. No one has adequate training and the ones who are trained and want to advance can't due to poor management. Walmart is no longer family oriented in any way shape or form. It is sad to see the chain falling apart at the seams for customers and employees alike. Sam walton is rolling in his grave."
good,Meeting and greeting new guest.I learned the retail  side of a store.Great co-workers
good,Pay is fairly low ability to move up is extremely low job is fairly easy how ever its not a long term career for most
good,busy job always working hard good co workers to work with and be
good,"i enjoyed stocking and assisting customers daily. management is horrible in all honesty. I feel like management at walmart could be better most of the managers dont appreciate hard work of the associates,"
good,"Super fast paced, huge work loads"
good,Fun place to work and a place you can grow. the chance to work so many different people is a plus. The day to day chance to work through other peoples needs is fulfilling.
good,supervisors need more training and need to follow through with training  the people you work with are good people but try to get away with whatever they can
good,Co-workers in the facility I was employed at are overall enjoyable and friendly. Management has expectations higher than should be expected.
good,I would come in and start counting the podium with money and check on breaks and lunches. Then I would help and watch what goes on the during the day. At night I would collect all the money out of the registers.
good,Have to be able to stand for long periods of time. Great job if you love to work with people in public setting. You have great co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.
good,"I would still be there today if the compensation were higher and the management wasn't undermined constantly by higher-ups.  I loved my department manager and assistant manager, but they received little respect when larger decisions were on the table."
good,"I don't want to sound too negative, but in over 10 years of working at Walmart, I've learned that the typical ""horror"" story tends to be true. Walmart prides itself in saying things like ""Our average worker makes over $12 an hour,"" but that is only true if we're averaging salaried management as well. If you take them out of the equation, pay drops drastically. My job is relatively complicated to do: lots of responsibilities. The most enjoyable part is having a position that pays more than 90% of the positions within Walmart not including management. Management is at best mediocre and at worst straight up incompetent - with a few exceptions. My advice is to steer away from working for that company if you  can."
good,"Job is easy if you like dealling with the public, pay is ok but management doesnt care about if the employee is sick/hurt. This company really is all about the money and not the employee."
good,A typical day at work would be just getting there and ringing out customers as a cashier. I learned that while being a cashier you meet a lot of different people and although you do not realize that as a cashier you still meet people and form bonds with them. As far as the co workers a lot of them were cool but there were others who i didn't feel the need to get to know because they were always so negative. There wasn't really anything hard about working for Walmart. The most enjoyable part of my day was making people feel good when checking out with me.
good,"None  Completive Wage"
good,Wal-Mart is a nice place to work but I would like to have a schedule that is more structured.
good,I love meeting new people and just talking to them while I ring them up at the register
good,"I had a really good time working for Walmart as far as the customer base. With my co workers we Worked really good together in maintaing the store, but with management They never could get on the same page, there was so much miscommunation that alot of times I was unsure what I was suppose to do first. But over all I love the customer base and it is a really fun place to work when you adjust to the miscommuncation, and stress the importance of the needs that you have until you are able to find someone that will listen and help you to get to where you want to be within the company."
good,"a typical day at walmart was busy full of work with a lot to do I learned a lot from working at walmart it allowed you to work on your people skills , talking to people greeting them asking do they need any help with anything solving problem they may . the management is ok . my co-worker are wonderful i get alone with everyone . the hardest part of my job is researching shortages and overages .the most part i enjoyed about my job is that it was in the morning so i got off early"
good,Overall working for this company has been a great learning experience. I loved working with my co working but management leaves a lot to be desired. I work over night so be able to balance life outside of work is not always easy.
good,"A typical day for me consists of signing into my till, checking a communication binder. Dealing with customers through phone or person. If by phone, I am parking calls, transferring calls, speaking over a PA system answering questions & giving general information. If in person, I am returning, exchanging or selling items through my till. I am ordering money for my till, doing international money transfers, directing to whom-ever, answering questions & giving general information. If I am not at my main till, I am covering a cashier's break on till, putting stock back to the salesfloor, or I am doing misc jobs. "
good,"itwas an okay place to work,but it takes forever to make any money"
good,"Sales and Customer Service"
good,"There are too many Managers with power that give separate directions. No one is on the same page. Things are unproductive due to being given one direction and being stopped to do another direction, and this process goes on throughout the day. Co-Workers are nice and friendly, most associates are willing to help you. However, when given a new position no one trains you in that area. Management expects you to learn things on your own."
good,enjoyed meeting new people. the only time it was not fun was at christmas time  very stressful.
good,"Problemas com ambiente de trabalhos,Política de avaliação do colaborador muito superficial, deixando passar muitas qualidades e não aproveitando todo o potencial do profissional da área."
good,"Manager refused to compensate me for my more than 10 years plus experience and started me with $7.50 minimum pay per hour. Mind you,I worked for the same Walmart company in Pennsylvania. I like the cashiering in general. It's my hussle job; when, things get a little slow in getting work that I can use my other skills, which I prefer. I like working and helping people. Like to make a difference, even if it's with a good morning with a smile, how can I help you?"
good,"a typical day was actually tolerable, but everything that i dont like about the job happens at least once a day and it gets old after a year and a half. i enjoy working outside a lot and is the reason i turned down a promotion to produce and overnight. "
good,Walmart is a great company to work for. The benefits are incredible and I love my co-workers. It's like being in one huge happy family.
good,Good company but doesn't have consistent work. Great pay but you don't get all your hours. Not great choices for lunch. A hot environment to work in.
good,low morale low hours odd hours not enough cashiers too many in the morning not enough at night
good,"Its a very busy and ongoing work place. You have to be open to new ideas and more opportunities for generating sales. I would typically come in check my my department area, making note of what needs to be done. I would then make list of things that need to be done , listing them from most important to least important. From there work on them throughout the time I was schedule to work."
good,My typical night was clocking in and then down stacking pallets of frozen or dairy foods. I would stock the shelves and if needed make labels for boxes with extra items in it. After stocking we would have to put our extra stock in the correct freezer and bin the items.
good,they play favorites the hardest part of the job is cramming all the work into 5hrs
good,"The workplace was a good environment to be in. I worked in the fashion section of the store and learned not only about the retail aspects of the job but also about the entire store."
good,"This was a great experience and starter job as a teen. My job was a cashier, I didn't really like standing in one spot all day. This just wasn't the job for me, however I do believe that there is many growth potential at this job as I have seen from others."
good,Due to the Nature of the Job and Potential Violence the only Support available was Floor Associates and you had Minimum requirements for Monthly Arrests recovery of Merchandise was not taken into consideration.
good,"The other employees were very pleasant to work with, although on a whole there weren't enough hours being given to work and the management was poor. We weren't given our breaks on time more often than not, management didn't listen to us,  and to be honest there isn't any advancement to be found here when you're an older individual."
good,Get money bag; get register assignment; satisfy customers until end of work period.
good,walmart was definitely an experience. I learned a lot I showed others how to properly help a customer and ensured the customer had a good shopping experience
good,"I enjoy my day at walmart because I work with so many different people whom I think of as my second family, I fully enjoy helping and meeting all our great customers and many of our vendors,walmart is a good place to work, but we seem to have far more mgrs in the store and we never have enough associates which makes how customer service not to mention associate moral to be low."
good,What do you expect? It's a big corporation and sometimes the little people in the middle are forgotten.
good,"I was fired from being a bakery worker at Wal-mart because the bakery manager told me to do something for her on her day off. Nothing unusual about that, but the store managers thought that the bakery manager stole the product that I prepared for her and thought that I must have been in on the theft, since I did not walk my manager to the register and make sure she paid for it (even though I had never been told to walk ANYONE to the register, let alone my boss.) "
good,"A demanding job in order to keep up with the current community."
good,"Long hours for little pay, Managment doesnt care about the staff."
good,"A typical day at work for me starts with anywhere from 3 to 5 employees stopping me before I get to the time clock needing me to fix something for them. After I have taken care of the first wave of employees I check my emails and make sure there are no compliance issues that need to be handled. Once I have handled all pressing issues I go over any training exercises that need tending to and update any personnel files that need my attention. If there are no new hires with I-9's needing verification or orientations I can get started on budgeting the next weeks scheduled hours or tend to any minor issues management might need to to handle. At the end of my day I have 2 more waves of employees needing my help with a multitude of different things that range from benefit information to time clock trouble shooting. The most enjoyable part of my day is also the most busy, helping the employees."
good,"Nothing special, nothing great. Typical customer service/cashier job."
good,"I enjoyed working as a cashier, and liked the people that I worked with. Walmart does not hire new, full-time employees."
good,The typical day at work you come in clock in go to work.Most of the co-workers was great to work with. The most enjoyable part of the day was seeing my customers returning.
good,"I enjoyed he huge customer-interaction,and the opportunity to learn new things"
good,"everyday I would deal with customers who had a sense of self entitlement. they were always first no matter if you had your hands full or if you were dealing with another customer. cleaning my department and maintaining a clean order department was also part of my day to day task. filling the empty or low items display. cash out customers. As a connection center associate, I would answer customers questions concerning cellular services post-paid and pre-paid. "
good,"A typially day at walmart include dealing with plenty of people and cash management . i learned greatcustomer service and ho to work in stressfull situations .managment is OK . co workers are OK, hardest part dealing with rude customers"
good,I had to be at work for 8am. First I go clock in and go the the front end and get with a Customers Service Manager. They she tell me what area I would be working to day. They she give me my money bag to set up. Then I go the the area he/she assign me and set up and wait on my customers.
good,"Cashier, co workers helped with questions more than management"
good,"The work was fine. It was not easy, but it was work. The management was the only problem. They were disrespectful as well as rude. They also seemed to forget that the workers are human beings and not robots. I did not have any problems with coworkers besides the managers."
good,"When I started at Walmart the company was more family oriented with flexible scheduling and management had more freedom with associates.  Over the years as policies changed and became military like, the way to run a store changed. Its like Home Office micro manages every aspect of the store.  With that being said it is what you make it.  There are opportunities to excel and move up in the company."
good,"A typical day at work would be walking into the pharmacy with inventory to stock, returns to package and send, Insurance claims to be followed up on and a line of customers to help. I definitely learned a lot about prioritization and multi-tasking while employed there. I participated in helping the pharmacist complete certain compounds and assisted in completing reports as well as trained co-workers. Leading some tasks/projects and having been understaffed was difficult at times but it helped me develop a sense of urgency with staying accountable to quality and patient care. I enjoyed being able to train newer technicians and help in other areas of the organization."
good,"Walmart changed there policy, you have to be temp for 6 months before they will hire you as a part time employee. Also the pay if low."
good,"very inconsistent, lack of professionalism, it was not a very bad experience"
good,Working at Wal Mart was a good experience on a customer service level. Its a very fast paced environment you must be able to multi task. The management always had the best interest of the employees and customers. The hardest part of the job was making sure to try and help every customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the experience it provided.
good,"•	Stocked inventory; Helped customers check out, return, or exchange merchandise; "
good,"Estres debido a la falta de liderago por parte de niveles superiores"
good,"Nights at work go by slow with so little time and much to do. although its though sometimes to deal with different managers telling you to do various things its enjoyable, because i like to prove im caple of doing it. the hardest part of my job is physically lifting certain product, climbing ladders and dealing with a few challenging customers. the most enjoyable part of my job would be getting things done."
good,The company was a lot more efficient and pro workers before Sam Walton died and the company went in the hands of his children.
good,"Typical day at work consists; Upon clocking in, all construction crew members meet in the middle of the store to discuss performance, set-up, and/or individual issues that need to be addressed before starting the days assignment. Drive over to the warehouse set up, format, load and upload trucks to be driven over to Walmart store where other construction crew members are complete their portion of job assignments. What I've learned is the details and complexity of converting a typical Walmart into a Walmart Super store. Management, for the most part, were well versed in the process needing to be completed in order to convert the store. Very knowledgeable. Co-workers were very fun and interesting to work with. Hardest part of the job was the heat during the summer that we were completing this job assignment. The most enjoyable aspect of this job assignment was the opportunity to be apart of a long lasting change/difference that the entire shopping community will be able to enjoy for many years to come."
good,"They keep you busy and expect a lot. My co-workers were great to be with. If you spoke to management, then you could get along with them."
good,"I did mostly the same work each night, clean the floors or washrooms. Management was not properly trained and expected far too much out of their team."
good,"Working in the Home Office for 5 years, you learn that people that look, talk, and act like the leadership move forward quickly. If you don't fit in the mold (IE Round peg), you aren't going anywhere."
good,"Cool job, I would definitely go back to work for them. a typical work day would include stocking and providing customer service"
good,"Clean restrooms"
good,"If you like retail, Walmart is a good stable workplace"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my day is being able to meet ad help a variety of people with a variety of needs, while the hardest part of my day is completing assigned tasks without the proper tools."
good,This was my first retail job and I enjoyed working with customers.
good,great if you dont have any schooling or experience. doing inventory every year is painful. black friday is dangerous.
good,"it was an ok place to work but it does not pay enough to live, the co workers are fun to work with but management needs some work. there should be more benifiets for employees but overall an ok place to work."
good,Sometimes hard to work for. Seems like you cant never please management. But on the other hand co-workers are very nice and helpful.
good,i worked back doing basic work of a unloader/sorter we also helped out in other departments. with equipment trying to unload truck in two hour limit. that was hardest part.  the feeling get when jobs done.
good,"La afluencia de clientes en la tienda diariamente es considerable, aún cuando no todos compran, pero si desacomodan la mercancía, de ahí que al llegar lo primero que hacia era dar un recorrido, para detectar que no era del departamento o que estaba fuera de lugar, checar los huecos sacar de bódega o levantar pedido si se encontraban agotados, trabajo administrativo como negativas existencias en ceros con ventas actualizar inventario, trabajar agotados realizar pedidos, organizar a mis asociados para planogramar, trabajar guias de mercadeo, checar la mercancía recibida en el día, y siempre atentos a lo que el cliente necesita. Supervisar el trabajo de la promotoría, También era mi responsabilidad el cuidar el robo por lo que tenía que detectar qué se debía de alarmar y con que tipo de alarma, aprendí a no tener mercancía de más para evitar amortizaciones de dinero que no círcula correctamente ha manejar los días de venta, detectar mi top ten de lo más vendido."
good,As a professional at Walmart you seemed lost in circus atmosphere of the store itself.  Not a favorable professional environment.
good,I have loved my job. But it seems that the company has gotten so big that they really don't care for their employee's like they use to.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers and co-workers.
good,"Overall was good opportunity for growth as individual."
good,"o local de trabalho era om devido aos funcionarios, mas a empresa deixava a desejar no sentido de não insentivar e não dar muita opção de crescimento ao funcionario,"
good,Had a lot of fun making sandwiches and working with the co-workers.
good,"I would work with patients daily with optical orders,also assisting Dr. with pretesting and maintaining files and insurance orders,"
good,"I enjoyed the interaction with customers and associates and have a new respect for retail associates,"
good,"Started very well as it was a brand new store. After a couple years, management became lazy and not caring of employee health. Also, poor with scheduling and controlling overnight overtime, leading 1st and 2nd shifts talking extended breaks. Poor with hiring system and pulling employees from their designated areas to registers due to lack of cashiers. Co-workers were the only enjoyable part of working. Corporate ignorant about injuries if not minority. Unable to get work-comp after surgery due to work related back injury. Highly do NOT recommend working there."
good,Work at Walmart is difficult from day to day. the routine management  wants you to follow is nearly impossible with the time and tools they barely provide you.
good,a typical day at work was very hectic never enough people to do the work but you have to adjust and make do and still be able to be friendly to the customers. I had very nice people that I worked with in my department and I think that was the best part of my job . the worst part was lack of support from management they never seemed to be on the same page with how to do things
good,"Not as veteran friendly as many people think."
good,they have no idea how to manage their people and they play favorites
good,"i enjoyed working at walmart  it was tough at times mostly having to breakdown pallets , but i enjoyed  the ability of expressing my creativity threw cake decorating"
good,Typical night at work entailed taking the daily freight and merchandise off the trucks and restocking the shelves in the department assigned to for the night. Learned how to self manage my time as management did not fully oversee each department I was trusted to have the job done before the shift was over and when I finished early I would assist in other departments. The hardest part of the job was getting a regular sleep schedule with it being an overnight shift and on a part time basis.
good,"Not many responsibilities as a cashier, but there always seemed to be ""too many chiefs, not enough Indians"" which made things difficult at times because you are told several different things by different ""managers"""
good,"A typical work day involves a lot of stress due to managements inability to order necessary items for the department, and lack of knowledge of what to do when a problem occurs. If something vital to the functioning of the environment breaks no one knows what to do and frequently the employees even if they are new are left to deal with the problem as best as they can. The majority of the employees are petty selfish people who willingly spread rumors and under no circumstance hesitate to stab others in the back if it will benefit themselves. The only good thing about this job is that they are willing to work with your schedule."
good,"The people there at wal-mart were very friendly I learned about baking bread and pastries, also how to do much prep most of the management was very pleasent. Alot of the co-workers were also very nice . A typical day there consists of mostly stocking and serving customers, the thing I most enjoyed about working there was the atmosphere very pleasant."
good,"A typical day was stocking shelves and putting things in the right place, which was challenging when the customers would pick up an article move to another place because they decided they didn't want or couldn't afford before they reached the cashier.  The people you work with came from different cultures and was interesting at times, but everyone got along quite well.  You meet all kinds of people working in a place like this and I enjoyed helping people find what they wanted for their needs.  The hardest part was stocking furniture, because of the weight.  The pay was not great, but the benefits made it a little better."
good,"A typical day was a very busy day. Plenty to do. I learned more than just being a regular cashier. I learned things working in the MoneyCenter that I had never done before. Such as, how to process money transfers through moneygram, money orders, express bill pays among other things. The people that I worked with were very nice and enjoyable to be around with the exception of some management. The hardest part of my job was not being able to make each and every one of my customers happy, because there were some things that I just wasn't able to do. It wasn't because I didn't want to or didn't try. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that when I got to work, I was going to be around people that I really cared for and that once my day got started, I was going to see customers that I thought a lot of and that thought a lot of me. While working there, I was given the opportunity to work with some really nice people as well as meet some really nice people."
good,"A typical day is to count all the money in 40+ registers, balance registers, create deposits generated by computer, sort reports, assemble reports, find register shortages and overages, assist customers with lost receipts. "
good,I have to meet production which is difficult due to the different freight that is handled. Sometimes you can get production and sometimes you cannot.
good,"O dia na empresa era bem acelerado, era preciso estar sempre atento ao que estava faltando nos balcões, sempre limpando tudo, higienizando para servir bem aos clientes, atender da melhor maneira possível."
good,the raises are not enough. One time a year and it's only 40 cents for most people
good,very demanding but little pay they wanted you to break your back and neck for them but didn't look out for you couldn't get the days off I wanted
good,I learned alot from walmart. i learned i can handle most situations as they arise. I learned that a smile and respect for the indivual goes along way. I was in charge of a crew of 7 it was trial and error. I improved the graveyard sales by 4% the first three months with no accidents.
good,"My opinion is don't work here unless it's your first job. In that case it's a great first job. You learn a lot about the company and how it works. Some things aren't ran the right way...well a lot of things. Don't let them put too much on you like I did. I was doing the work of several people all because they didn't want to hire me any help. I worked in 3 different departments with one manager over me and one other coworker, both of which I hardly saw. When I did get to work with them it was so much easier on us all and actually enjoyable."
good,"A typical day usually consists of cleaning up the counters in my respective department, working freight, and helping customers. I've learned more than I can put into words from the people I work with. Management experience varies. I have great managers and a few iffy managers, but overall they're good people. The hardest part of working retail is dealing with difficult, disrespectful customers. The best part about my job is my co-workers."
good,"My manager was wonderful to work for, as well as the upper management their"
good,"Walmart really does have some great qualities, but for a huge company, it's a really hard place to work."
good,"It doesn't take long to realize that Wal-Mart used to be a great place to work, and is now the nightmare you hear about."
good,A typical day at work consist of stocking the merchandise. I get along with my co-workers well. We work as a team. The hardest part us when some members of management do not bother to help you or see if you are going to need any help.
good,Greeting customers and running a cash register. That's all.
good,"Everyday I went to work, I knew I'd be with co workers who I also called friends. They treated me like an equal (most of the time) and the job itself was easy and manageable if you knew how to do it correctly."
good,"It is my personal experience that working for Wal-Mart can be a less than satisfying experience, especially after the various boasts made during the application and training process. "
good,"When I first began working for this store in 2008, I loved the environment. This store slowly became one that was full of managers who picked their favorites. Their favorites would never get in trouble and the non-favorites would get in trouble for things that they knew the favorites were doing. For example, I was let go May 29, 2014 for tardies, not absences, but tardies when I know for a fact that there are associates that have numerous absences but they are never called into the office. Honestly, that is why I wanted to work in the office because I did not want to work along side those who got away with everything."
good,"Ok everyone knows about walmart.If you take the manager from Renewit, give them the money and pwer walmart has, Raitings go up."
good,It was an easy stocking job but the pay rate was not enough to live uncomfortably.
good,"Like any job it has pros and cons. I worked at Walmart for about 5 and a half years. I actually moved from one department to another, Pharmacy was my last department. It was a very hardworking yet tiring experience. I learned a lot about retail and the business behind it. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and managers at the Vision center and Pharmacy. The store where I worked at was very labor intensive with limited employees. The hardest part of the job was asking for help with store management team on a task that did not provide any prior training and getting no response. As a result I learned to work independently. On the bright side, I had a fulfilling experience working with my co-workers and helping different customers. I acquired interpersonal skills by interacting with people all day. In the end, it was an experience worth gaining."
good,I learn a lot about retail and to manage people and department. Work with some great people.
good,"I enjoyed going to work everyday. The customers were friendly, my co-workers were easy to get along with. Management was okay, they had good days and bad. Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers happy."
good,"I like helping people, Its great when its busy which that's always mon-sun. The time goes by quick there is always something to do. The management at my location aren't the most appreciative of their workers which makes it hard to love being there. I find that to  be the hardest part of the job."
good,"Your work here will be very repetitive, not always a positive environment.. management doesn't work with you very well either. You're on your feet all day (invest in insoles!) and hard work typically isn't recognized (seems like nothing is ever good enough). The paycheck is the only real ""enjoyable"" part of the job and that's not saying much at minimum wage."
good,some nights are ok some are rough it depends on amount of freight and if co workers call out that can determine the course of the shift.
good,"A typical day at Walmart would be clocking in, asking a supervisor what line to go to, get my work station cleaned, then start checking out customers. I learned how to help customers with questions, be more social and how to stock inventory. The hardest part of being a Cashier at Walmart is standing all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-worker's and genuinely nice people."
good,"No day at work is the same, with customer service each customer brings a new experience. I've learned that customers come first because they play a major role in the success of a company. The managers and co-workers are very approachable, and easy to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is being friendly and getting to know my customers."
good,"This is more of an high school job,not for an adult, that has major bills. Schedule is real unpredictable."
good,"I worked here for nearly 2 years, Management can be really bad or good no in between"
good,"working with customers , waiting on customers, cook and clean management was very upfront coworkers were great hardest part was cleaning the fryers, most enjoyable was meeting new people"
good,"too much to list on a negative basis, working with fellow associates was a great experience."
good,"I hated working for this place, i lived pay check to pay check and that is only because after 4 years and still part time. Tired to advance on several occasions. They have their picks and favorites, and they are the only ones schedule they will work with."
good,"Your experience from previous employers doesn't really matter, you basically get paid the same as someone who has very little on the job experience. It would be a good job if it paid more."
good,My experience at Wal-Mart wasn't the best but I made the best out of the situation.
good,Great job for when I was on breaks during the summer from college. Made some decent money and the workload wasn't too overbearing.
good,"Travail routinier, mauvaise gérance, clients méprisants."
good,"Education friendly "
good,"The hardest part of my job was leaving everybody behind, when I was done with my shift, and everyday I enjoyed the people who I worked with and the customers."
good,"a typical day at work is busy"
good,between 7am and 11am is scanning outs picking items out of backroom and working them. next change onhand counts to zero if we don't have the item. lunch then side counter maintence which consist of picking a section and cleaning the shelves and making sure all items have a price tag. From 2pm to 4pm zoning then go home. I learned I can rely on myself a lot ore then I thought. I have learned to trust others with what I ask my workers to do. I learned keeping calm under pressure and rise to the circumstances. The hardest part of my job isbe put down by upper management all the time.  Most enjoyable is seeing the costumer happy when they find a item they needed.
good,"Train new partners and execute proper department recovery. Develop strategies to execute and establish SOPs as per company guidelines. Perform activities such as loading, unloading and movement of bulky and heavy products for stocking."
good,"I had to clean, help customers, help other employees, heavy lifting, sign off on safety checks, and other random odd jobs around the store."
good,Pues la verdad el area en el que yo estaba estaba muy pesado el ambiente
good,Nao estava satisfeita com a empresa por que era quebrado o quadro de caixas e nao tinhamos o reconhecimento.
good,"the benefits are only for full time employees.management are difficult to talk to and they do play favorites with people they are friends with or related to.co worker are friendly but can also be nasty by causing trouble for you with management.the hardest part of the job was keeping up with all the managers orders because they don't talk to each other about anything and you have to do whatever they tell you.the most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers you see every day.   I learned that walmart needs a better management system ,security,and abetter way of handling problems within."
good,"My day started by unloading the new days stock and then by restocking the items that had been taken by customers over night. The day is full of unloading, stocking and cleaning of the work area."
good,"The managers aren't the worst which is saying something. The benefits and pay get better with tenure and promotions. Promotions aren't too difficult to come by. However, it is very difficult to get a full-time job here."
good,Benefits was lowered. Nearly impossible to get full time employment.
good,Walmart was a very busy place. Typical day at work was rush to get people out. Working on a deadline and completing tasks in a timely manner is one of the things I learned at Walmart. Also working as a team. Management was ok. Busy also. Co-workers were great. Fun. The hardest part of the job was taking a deep breath and walking away knowing your right. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. Getting to know the regulars that came in everyday and building relationships with them.
good,Stressful environment. Great team at Walmart.  Enjoyed working with my team.
good,"Over see overnight crew, check reports, price changes, work freight, associate meeting, make sure stockers are keeping busy getting freight out onto the sales floor, zoning, inventory, binning product, scheduals, unloading truck. looking over managers notes and fixing issues on sales floor"
good,"This is a typical retail job. You scan the items that the customer is purchasing, take payment for the order, and provide great customer service."
good,"Uma excelente empresa para se trabalhar e uma política ideal para uma empresa, onde o entendimento dos funcionários mais antigos que compreendem como o sistema funciona e transmite de forma clara como se deve trabalhar, porém nota-se uma certa deficiência pela parte da gerencia talvez pela inexperiência e principalmente não sabendo lhe dar com o ser humano. O setor onde trabalhei como fiscal de prevenção e perdas, era um setor um pouco isolado dos restantes dos funcionário pós trabalhávamos com a segurança da empresa, o trabalho tinha que ser em equipe dependíamos uns dos outros. Com tudo o relacionamento com os demais funcionários era tudo bem. A pior parte do trabalho era lhe dar com bandidos, pois eramos nos que realizarmos as abordagens com muita cautela e respeito para evita qualquer tipo de problema e a melhor parte era quando o encarregado reconhecia nossos serviços atingindo metas e objetivos da empresa."
good,"You are told where to go by a machine, try not to take too long to get to where it tells you, (bathroom breaks or any reason) you can get written up for such acts, you must not have any confrontation at all with the customer that's your bosses job. you get a 15 minute break from WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR REGISTER. you must remember this; they will write you up for being even a minute over, and it is your responsibility to ask EVERY customer for the Walmart credit card, and remember if you don't ask that is a write-up-able offence and your responsibility to ask EVERY customer. It's also your responsibility to be fast while dealing with the customers if your items per hour is below 485 you will get written up or terminated, and remember at any point it's up to the managers discretion whether your being insubordinate or not....when you get your lunch break your given an hour but typically your boss will ask you to take 30 minutes, you are not to leave your register at the end of the day until your manager tells you to, as well as going to any of your breaks is up to your managers discretion, The best part of that job was probably the coworkers to help train and break up the monotony with and also to make a small network of people that care about each other and try to help. I also liked management typically unless someone who let the power go to their head got in the managerial position, my favorite part of this job was dealing with the good people and helping the good people, the hardest part was most of the job but I did not talk about it until now."
good,Es un buen ambiente de trabajo solo que absorbe todo el tiempo y la vida personal desaparece
good,"Walmart is just for if you're trying to save money. I wasn't there long, just for a summer vacation job. It's very easy, but very tiring standing and doing the same thing for 8 hours at a time."
good,My job included running the cash register and helping customers with anything that they needed.
good,"A typical day would be ensuring all associates were receiving the teaching and training they needed to perform their job. This would include following up with members of management for associate evaluations, attendance tracking , and overall training."
good,Good places and people to work with. Was giving opportunities to learn a lot about the business and other positions but the pay was terrible.
good,"I was an Overnight Processor and a Department Manager. I learned that some companies care about their employees' but Management at certain stores do not. Most of the Overnight Staff were miserable, unfriendly, and not team players. Then, there were the Bullys, which besides my promotion were a main reason for me to leave Overnight, even though the pay was better than a Department Manager. As a Department Manager, I was thrown into the position. This Walmart had a ""Sink or Swim"" approach to all it's positions. The hardest part of my job as trying to communicate with a manager that cared about the employees and company, than their paycheck. The most enjoyable part of my job was briefly having a Department Manager help me with tasks I was never trained to do but were needed for my position."
good,"good company to work for good training program,good people"
good,The day started with me pushing carts followed by emptying garbage cans when requested helped customers with groceries. Then it ended with me pushing carts.
good,"Saving people money, is the mantra of Walmart. However, this means cutting production costs...at all costs. Many departments are void of employees during the day. I hear of customers searching for help, only to find empty isles with unstocked shelves and no associates to help. The stress of this fact is put on the few employees that walmart does have during the day, who often are forced to cover many departments. The frustration continues as management wonders why their picks and freight aren't completed. Threats and verbal abuse is likely to pursue as they have no understanding as to what workload the floor associates really have to deal with. Many workers are civil human beings with a consciousness, who wish to help others in need. We help our customers find products, answer questions, and provide a friendly shopping environment. This must all be thrown out the door in order to meet up with the demands of management and in order to keep your job. This is not the company to work for. I really cannot be more adamant of that fact."
good,"some days good others very hectic"
good,"Not really a good job to have as your only job. The company starts off stating that you will work temporary then get hired on full time, but then they start giving you part time hours."
good,"Making sure that stock is in the proper place, scan to make labels so that they can be binned in the back and put away items that would not fit on shelf. Making sure that area is clean and free of any safety issues and that shelves look stocked and items are face forward at the end of the shift"
good,"The pay is far from good.  They claim to be family oriented, until the school calls and says that you have to come pick up your son.  They expect one person to do 3 peoples job. The management team was adequate, but lacked in communication between themselves and lost their tempers often on employees, treating them like they were low downs.  when someone got injured, they were creative in finding ways to get rid of them.. Honestly the only good thing I remembered about working at that particular Walmart, was my fellow associates, of which some became really good friends."
good,"Wal-Mart was an ok place to work, at least the location where I worked was. On the other hand, it would be the last place I would look for employment."
good,"I was a cashier and it was very fastpaced. During the seasonal period it gets even busier so if you can keep up this is the job for you. I really liked the envionment they have, the employees are very nice and fun to work with."
good,Low pay with little benefits. Ok if you just want to get by but even as you advise don't expect to make much past 25k
good,"Maintains the Dairy/Frozen area in accordance with Company policies and procedures by  properly handling claims & returns, zoning the area, arranging and organizing merchandise/               supplies, identifying shrink and damages, ad ensurig a safe work environment. Maintains merchandise presentation in the Dairy/Frozen area by stocking and rotating   merchandise, removing damaged or out-of-date goods, setting up, cleaing, and organizing "
good,"Biggest concerns are ongoing training time, notification of policy changes, and overall lack of strong management skills from store leaders."
good,management stepped all over employees and did nothing to contribute.
good,For the most part working here was alright until close to the end when a young boy was hired who disrespected me and the managers would not even talk to him.
good,"I was only fortune it enough to work for maybe 3 good managers my entire career at Wal-Mart. It's really unfortunate that they will probably not have a chance to move up the ladder. I was with the company for awhile and was making a decent buck, but not for the work that the place required."
good,"A typical day at work was to run the front end .. manage over 30 employers, bring money to cashiers and other departments work in any department if needed"
good,"Walmart Canada is a very tough place to work for a typical day will require a very strenous amount of labour work and you are constantly on your feet cleaning things or pulling skids. Very labour intensive and you are very underpaid. "
good,"I worked for the company for over 12 years and the company has under gone changes that I didn't agree with. When I first started working there, the motto was, ""People first in everything we do"". By the time of my departure it was now the 4S's (Sales, Service, Save, Selection). Money became the number one goal and the workers became a lot more expendable. Promotions weren't considered based on knowledge, seniority or work ethic, but more on who you know and politics. There is very little work/life balance. They force new mothers to work the overnight shift, holidays were mandatory and we only received 1 comp day for working all those extra days during the holidays. If you are a salaried manager, they basically own you. Don't get me wrong, I learned a lot from the company. I just can't continue to work for a company with such little regard for the people that work for them."
good,"it is a store where you are just a number"
good,Needs improvement on management. And also fairness within the associates.
good,The managers don't work with you on any scheduling problems. At walmart I loved my co-workers and I learned many communication skills and helping to meet each customers needs.
good,I learned a lot during my time there.  I am grateful for the opportunity to grow as a manager.  Walmart will definitely grow your character.
good,limited opportunity as food departments are restructuring
good,es una empresa con gran nivel de personal pero mucho tiempo de espera para poder tener puestos buenos en la visión salarial
good,Aprndes muchas cosas y sirven de mucho pero la gerencia es un caos
good,A typical day at work consisted of stocking merchandise and do customer service. I learned how important a cheerful attitude is to get a sale completed. In my department we only had about 4 employees other than the manager and we all tried hard to get the jobs for the day done on time and correctly. Dealing with being short sometimes and being pulled in many different ways.
good,"I cashier and work in electronics. the best thing about this job, is some of the people I work with. I have learned a lot about electronics."
good,"Overall the company is okay to work for. Clock in for work and go to the assigned register. Ring out customers, not so hard. The hardest part of the day is trying to keep yourself busy when the store is slow. My co-workers are awesome, I wish I could say the same about the management."
good,"Poor management"
good,lifting is the hardest part of this job and to pull 30 cases of water at once
good,"era uma boa empresa de trabalhar, mas havia muitas fofocas muitas brigas tive que sair pois queriam sempre me por a trabalhar fora do meu local.."
good,I enjoyed my tenure at Wal-Mart. As with any other job it has its ups and downs. The jobs are more enjoyable when you have a strong and supportive management team.
good,"I worked night shift, so the shifts were long. I picked up many stocking skills, and inventory management skills. Management was lazy. Co-workers were pretty helpful. The hardest part of the job was balancing it with my school work. The most enjoyable was satisfying customers."
good,Walmart is a good place for experience dealing with the public.
good,"A typical work day for me at Wal-Mart was never guaranteed that I was going to have help for the day. I usually had about 7 to 8 notes I had to finish on my own before my lunch. The average person there only received 3 to 4 notes, but I was an exception to that because our management team knew I was the one to finish them in a timely manner. To my management team I was the ""go to guy"". I would always be the one that would do any type of job no matter what it was. My co-workers sometimes helped my with a question I had but most of the time I was alone doing every tasked I was assigned to. The hardest part of the job was that I hardly ever had help with what I was assigned to. I had to finish everything on my own from beginning to end. My management team was very good to me at the beginning of my career there at Wal-Mart. But over time they began to take advantage of me by volunteering me to go over night with out asking me if it was possible. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with so many people and that was able to boost my confidence to talk in front of people."
good,"As a 2year associate I have seen constant and drastic changes within my company. Benifits? Yes. Some really good and some not so good. Excellent Dental and very reasonable, Health insurance? Hard to touch financially. Beside with the comepany becoming mostly part-time, with a two year wait on medical insurance pretty out of reach. We are given sick time but, do not use it unless you schedule it in three weeks in advance. All absences count. Doctors notes don't mean a thing. 6 absences in a rolling 6 month period. NO MATTER what! Walmart has become very short term. part time employment. 75% of my co-workers get food stamps, medicaid or some other kind of assistance. Walmart expects total availability. 7 days per week.There ""OPEN DOOR""  policy sometimes work dependinf on who your managers are, ive seen some people use it and don't come back the next day. They call it ""OPEN AVAILABILITY"". So, don't plan on it as a second job. You will not get enough hours to support a family with out assistance. You might work 7am-4pm one day and 5pm-11pm the next. Turn around and be back first thing the next morning. Very hard to plan life around. They do schedule out 3 weeks but, forget flexability. Very disposable enviroment. Difficult to walk into work each day wondering if it is your last. Many get away with practically murder and others get raked over the coals for not breathing right. What is fair for one is not the same for another. To be an assistant manager is brutal. Up side? If you can hold on and make it 2 yrs. You can take the experience just about anywhere. Companies tend to respect"
good,"Was a great work environment for the most part! My typical day depended on what shift I had worked. I learned quite a bit about developing pictures, technology, and new machines. My co-workers were very easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job would be when the computers would break down and all of the chemicals would back up and the fumes would go into the air and we were required to clean it all up. The most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing all of the interesting pictures that were developed and hearing the stories behind the pictures."
good,experience a lot of different people and backgrounds a lot of different areas to cover a wide variety of advancement potential
good,I love working on cars And besides the small places i work before HERE is where i got my best and most experiences.I learned how to change cars.My hardest part of my job was the daily shift change..A typical at work was Spent well worked and productive.I enjoyed working because i was doing what i love which is working with cars.I always did some stocking and unloading their
good,"My day was answering phones and helping customers at the fitting room, with down time I zoned  the sales floor to keep clean and neat. I learned to deal with people, from happy ones to unhappy ones. I worked with several different managers that wanted the same job done different ways, and learned how to keep  them happy and that was hardest the hardest part of the job. The best part of the job was the co- workers they felt like family. I worked at Walmart for over 20 years and in that time I did different jobs and my favorite was dept. manager learning to do schedules, ordering, and keeping track of sales, controlling inventory."
good,"You can move up quickly in this company, but as fastest you moved up they put you don't."
good,"Es una buena empresa, solo que yo no encontré lo que buscaba, trabajar ahí era tener  a veces mucho estrés y no porque hubiera mucha gente si no con los jefes que repito hay mucha preferencia en el ámbito laboral"
good,"*a typical day consists of checking out customers "
good,"cashier,Logistics, stocking and sales. ,Reduce lines effectively . I really enjoy conversing with new people. A lot of experience in the field so it was very easy to me but inappropriate  favoritism."
good,"I come into a mess in the jewelry department, my department manager is usually in a rush to get out the door as soon as i get there and is telling me everything i need to do while i am trying to help customers. my co workers have nothing positive to say about customers or management. The hardest part is dealing with difficult people. most enjoyable is the sense of accomplishment when my department looks good."
good,"I worked for a walmart that was two towns over from my apartment at the time, and even though from the time i was hired i explained my situation, so a fixed schedule would be ideal for me, i could work early, and i'd always without a doubt be at work. "
good,"A typical day at work was to prepare deli and unload deli products, transfer stock to storage areas, sliced, cut, weigh, price stock, operate cash register, rotate and code all products, remove out-of-code merchandise, tag all products legibly in line with price book, as well as clean and sanitize the entire work area."
good,"This particular store is not an organized, communication and managment store. Some Managers are never to be found to address an issue with the department. "
good,"The hours and job load can take its toll. Inconsistent direction and unrealistic budgets, and changes in the company have lead to frustration and a change in career."
good,"Walmart can be an interesting, fast paced place to work with many rewarding moments. The number of things an associate can be ask to do in a shift can be extremely daunting. The expectations of the management can be unrealistic at times. The thing I enjoyed most was the appreciation in the eyes of a customer who you had really helped."
good,"I would get stopped every 5 minutes from customers and asked questions about items, where they were located and prices. your usually in charge of one section and most of the time a question would not be related for your department. I'm the type of person that if I work somewhere I want to know every question there is to answer.  I learned courteous gestures. cashier, inventory and customer service. I found it fun directing customers to the best product of its type, the best times would be working side by side by a manger when they have to make a attraction for a session/holiday, they called it making displays. my best moment  working there was on black Friday I had a  microphone and was on a tall latter outside talking to the crowd.  The  hardest part of my job was when they needed someone to work overnight for a couple weeks. putting out all the products making sure they where priced right and in the right spot and on a timer. After a while my body got use to the time difference and was able to find the product's location's quicker. The Management was horrible something I never seen before, they didn't know if u were on the clock if your on break. What you did for they day they were clueless, all they cared about was making sure the store was clean for the morning store boss. Someone like me finishes my section quick and since I'm done I have no choice but to  do another department witch I don't mind and don't complain but its  just unfair that other employees can milk the clock, clock in from break and stay in the break room and just walk around the store. I believe in if"
good,"A typical day at work consists of putting out freight, zoning the sales-floor, and helping customers with any questions they may have. "
good,i loved getting to interact with customers and co workers the only bad thing about Walmart some managers did their job and some did not and the ones that did do their job got wrote up the most.
good,good place to get some work experience and take it else were to Advance yourself
good,Would look for shoplifters and ways to stop loss prevention in the workplace
good,"On a typical day at Walmart, I enter and clock in and go straight to work in the parking lot. I use a machine that is remote controlled meanwhile I am gathering the carts through out the parking lot."
good,Wallmart  is a great place to work if you are a retired adult looking for a way to get out of the house or if you are a young adult at their first job or needing a job while you are in college. It is not recommended to work here if you have a family to support because the income is just not enough.
good,"I would go in at night and start stocking merchandise and/or taking inventory of our stockroom with my co-workers. I learned several things about how a retail store works and how to keep track of product stocked within the store. Our management was strict and sometimes played favorites with certain employees, which made it difficult to get things done in a timely manner. I liked a few of the co-workers I had but several of them were not willing to work within the parameters of the job and slacked off quite often, which would frustrate me endlessly. The hardest part of the job was trying to get things done while having a crew and management who didn't care and not having the proper tools to complete the job. The part I loved about the job was being able to complete a project before or on schedule and feeling a sense of accomplishment when it was done."
good,"As a first Job Walmart was enjoyable, in the beginning. For my first two years I enjoyed going to work every morning. I had decent hours and most of my management was kind. During the last six months it did go down in enjoyment due to change in faculty. I loved my coworkers and most other associates and was sad to go. But I did not feel room to grow at Walmart."
good,"My time at Wal-Mart has been great, but due to a few factors I feel it is now best for me to take what I've learned elsewhere to better myself. Within my Wal-Mart store the managers claim they are there to help you advance which is somewhat true. When they are ""helping"" you advance they really just work you down, expecting you to attain the unattainable in one shift when you would actually need about 2 or 3. Being with the company for 4 years now I must say that I look forward to seeing my co-workers on a daily, even the management team. its that I dislike anyone there I just feel that some people shouldn't be in the positions they are in because they are ineffective to there department supervisors and sales associates. while working here I've been taught the importance of customer service, the ability to maintain an inventory in multiple departments, and how to operate some power lifting equipment. Overall I've enjoyed Wal-Mart as my first job out of high school, but as I've stated before I do believe it is now time for me to move on to better things."
good,It was an opportunity to experience several different jobs under one roof and obtain skills to expand on for individual growth.
good,"You get to work with people of a great and outstanding, but the management is poor and does not care about the work force because you can be replaced easily."
good,"Wal-Mart is an awesome place to work. However, the management team was unorganized."
good,Did not care for management.  Was hard to get time off when requested.  I did enjoy being a cashier.  Felt the  customer service managers were helpful.
good,"A lot of people were there to gossip instead of doing their job, leaving excess work to be picked up by other teams."
good,I enjoy the customers and making them happy. I enjoy the people that I work with that makes my day. And you are utilizing a lot of people skill in a day to day job
good,it was easy and fun work the team i was working with where young but very spunky
good,I liked my job at walmart because I was working on cars and I am good at it.
good,"Walmart is not a bad place to work. it depends on what store and who your managers are, That depends on how great the time there will be. i learned a lot working there and it was great for advancing in my career."
good,"The Job taught me a lot , But the pay was a big issue , I felt like I wasn't  getting paid enough for my  hard work that I put in"
good,A typical day at wal-mart was unloading trucks packing skids and moving products to the sales floor. The team I worked with was great and we worked well together. Working at wal-mart there was no room for advancement but it was great working with customers.
good,"During my time at Walmart, I learned a lot. I was 17 when I started working for them, and honestly it was fun for the high-school mentality. As I matured and decided to look into college I was actually deterred by management to follow a college path. And by deterred I was told that they wouldnt be able to adjust my schedule around school, and an Assistant manager actually bragged about how he had no college and was making 28k a year."
good,"I worked in the bakery department, My day started at 9pm to 7am. I over look four employees that worked under myself as their team leader. I thought them how to make fresh donuts and how to bake. I also thought them how to get the bakery ready for Health inspection,which I always passed with flying colours."
good,"I enjoyed the busy work place, I learned how to work the cash register and other machines throughout the store.The overall management was excellent for the most part, I never had a problem with a fellow co-worker, the hardest part of my job was having a issue that i was unable to deal with until I learned the proper protocol for the situation. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my customers."
good,Bad pay. Its a very productive place to work but upper management needs to be better acquainted with associates.
good,"This was the first job I applied for and managed to work the longest at.  Wal-Mart opened up the opportunity to view the retail world and achieve personal changes throughout my life.  I transferred with this job to Florida until I found the job at Angelica and was able to start immediately upon my return to my hometown.  The first time I worked at Wal-Mart, I advanced from Cashier to Customer Service Manager to Cash Office/Accounting.  During my return back, I was able to start my college education and hold another full time position until my current job at Crabtree"
good,"Walmart was a good place to work to a certain extent, being that it was my first job. I learned several different job positions during the time that I was there. They have what they call cross training and that's what they do in order to help you learn more of the store. The only downfall to this, is if you work in an area that has a higher paygrade than you, you won't get paid the difference. "
good,Its a job that requires patience and you also need to be a people's person.
good,Difficult Work environment. Often work in other areas than those hired for. Management Staff can change rapidly. Management members are not always on the same page when it comes to employee job tasks or duties.
good,"Everyday you have a computer screens that you have to clear before you can even start your day, I learned how to manage my time quickly and effectively, Some management will show you how to do things but some will not I had the help of my co-workers to show how to do things the right way."
good,"Typical day at Wal-Mart was meetings, making schedules, helping customers, helping in other departments, cleaning backroom from night before truck, changing out mods etc. I loved my co-workers we worked well together and miss working with them. Hardest part of the job I would say pleasing the managers. Working at there you never work in your own department. When we go in the call us to backroom to clean up the truck from night before then we had to go and help put out stock by time we finish it already lunch then after lunch we get a list of notes to be completed by end of the day which is only about 3 hrs left in day. I always gave 110% even though they made us feel that we wasnt doing what we needed to do to get the work done. We had to try to complete their page of notes while helping customers and doing our everyday things in the departments to get done. So we learn to multitask a lot. I loved being a manager I miss it so much I loved the people and I loved helping people. I would say that is what I miss most about my job. I miss the satisfaction of my people doing a good job and could pat them on the back with a smile."
good,"I was a overnight manager, so my night began with a meeting to set the goal for the night. I had to make sure the trucks were unloaded, freight put on the shelves and the store cleaned every night. Plus handle customer service issues and accidents if any.  Most nights I had about 30 people working."
good,Zou het aanbevellen om voor Walmart the werken. Word ook zeer slecht betaalt
good,"u come in report to dept head and they tell what u will be doing for I the day"
good,"low paying company for maximum work.  Management was nice but the pay barely paid for the gas to and fr,"
good,"Typically I'd come into work, do the jobs of many other people, put a away a ton of stock and also clean my department. But in the middle of this because we'd be down cashiers I'd have to run to the front and run register. Some of the managers were unprofessional, and rude. Some were very pleasant. The hardest part was being able to focus on such tedious work for 8 hour shifts. The most enjoyable part was working with my coworkers."
good,good compensation but they keep the management team job scared
good,I enjoyed helping the customers with their purchasing decisions.
good,"Fast paced,  a lot of coworkers, a lot of job requirements. being able to meet new people was a thrill."
good,"Typical day we would do about 15 cars which would take up most of our time. The thing i learned from that the most is how to handle customers when you are dealing with something very dear to them, their vehicle. The hardest part of the job was when you would run into problems with cars. The most enjoyable part was the hours."
good,The management did not treat the employees with respect. Was at school at the time and they did not try to work around my schedule.
good,A typical day at Walmart was busy. They are really good about giving you time off if needed for other obligations.  The compensation and benefits are amazing IF you can get into a full time position.  Part time employees do not receive benefits.  I enjoyed working with others; the majority of the employees are very friendly.  The best part of the job is the social interaction and customer service.  The hardest part of this job was not getting enough hours and no benefits to support my family.
good,"Work was consistent, However; Management was vastly unavailable, They worked in 'cliques'."
good,eu gostava do eu fazia as pessoas com trabalhava mais a gerencia nao era muito profisional
good,This was a job that was demanding but it was very confusing. We were very short handed most of the time and management would push but at times they would be able to help out. They put people into areas that they were not comfortable with that position.  The coworkers were for the most part good but we tried to get through our shifts and get what we could done.
good,"Good place to work. Bad people working for the company. In any area of work only work should be carried out there but when managers get to much comfort in the friendship with those in the ranks, there will be rules and procedures broken and this team does not do what they are supposed to just to get ideas on private ventures."
good,"En este empleo lo que aprendí fue las relaciones interpersonales con las distintas personal, el trato día a día y el manejo de conflictos de índole laboral y gremial."
good,As one of my first jobs I would truly say it was a good learning experience but the pay was horrible for all the work that was done. A typical day at walmart would be a little stressful but could be very productive.
good,APM role started out as a role that could make an impact. Role has quickly changed into an unmanageable list of daily duties. No time is left for true shrink drill down. Each day is spent completing checklist developed by someone who does not work in a store.
good,"Lot's of work and not enough workers."
good,"Organizaçao de setores ( se vc e de uma  setor , por exemplo textil ,, vai aprender o que o pessoal da hortifrutas faz )."
good,"A typical day as a cahier is cashing customers out and making sure they have a good experience. I learned you cant make everyone happy but the best you can do is try. The management was not management at all more of just a status for them they just stood around and did nothing. My co-workers were very pleasant to work with, they were very helpful and kind. The hardest part of the job was keeping every customer happy so they would come back and shop again."
good,Walmart is a great company to work for as an hourly associate.  Once you go into Management they take over you life.  Hours are long and they expect you to basically live there.  Not a great company to be in management for if you have a young family.
good,I liked this job mainly because a lot of my friends and family worked here. The management was ok it could of been a lot better. I feel some managers had it out to get me most of the time. When I would walk in to do my job I didn't know if my manager wanted something done specifically. They told me bold faced that I'm supposed to know what I need to do.
good,my typical day start off by opening the money center. greeting customer anf cpmpleting transaction in a timly manor. the managment team wasnt that bright but we mangage to get thing do. my co-worker we became vey close and formed additiona relationship outside of the work work place. the hardes part of the job was been able to keep my clam with diffcult customer even wen tey are calling me out of my name. the most enjoyable of the job was dealing with the customers and making sure that everything went smoothly and seeing the customer leave with a smile on their face.
good,"Overall, a good place to work. Heavy lifting is required. Benefit plan is very good. 10% discount on all product. Working as a team as well as independently is very important. Management works to meet everyone's needs which, of course, is not always possible."
good,"various hours learned about store and where products were located, was not enough activity being a greeter."
good,"Though it may seem like working in customer service at Walmart is pretty basic and routine, really everyday is different along with every customer. Working at Walmart gave me the chance not just to meet and help someone new but to also get a chance to learn different departments and task around the store. Not only did management give me the chance to do other task around the store but also let me know what good of a job I was doing. Even though once in awhile you would get that one customer you couldn't help. It would still apply to my work ethic and make me strive to make sure it doesn't happen again, because having that customer leave with a smile on their face lets me know im doing a great job."
good,This company hasn't been one of the best places to work. The experience varies from store to store.
good,"Buena, un ambiente lavoral bueno ya que trabajas en equipo todo el tiempo"
good,"Due to low staffing and high demand in production.  Benefits are good with dental, 401k, stock and bonus.."
good,It's hard at first when you start working especially standing all day long. I learned how to work a cash register. Management is difficult to work with because of what they have to go by. Hardest part is working with customers who don't understand what the job demands. Most enjoyable part of the job is to be with your coworkers. They always make it good to go to work.
good,I liked working here but most times they were too disorganized
good,"A rotina era extressante,geralmente não tinhamos as ferramentas necessarias a nossa disposição,devido a esse problema,sempre estavamos correndo atras do tempo,no meu setor em especifico,era muito complicado por exemplo:fazer um pedido de uma determinada mercadoria,com muito tempo de antecedencia,pois nao tinha como ter um parametro certo de quanto iriamos vender,devido a clima,preço,qualidade e etc.tinhamos quem trabalhava com a gente mas tinhamos tambem quem trabalhava ""contra a gente""e isso era normal dentro da empresa.Mesmo com as dificuldades do dia dia,a empresa tinha uma boa cultura,pelo menos na intenção,porem por não ficar claro essa cultura,gera muita rotatividade e desconfiança por parte dos funcionarios que passam por la,mas mesmo assim tinha seus pontos bons,como por exemplo pra quem gostar e seguir,um plano de carreira.Sempre tive uma boa relação com todos,tentei seguir as diretrizes da empresa que conscistiam em respeitar o individuo,atender bem o cliente e com exelencia.Ja a liderança deixou muito a desejar,como prometer coisas e não cumprir,fora que por muitas vezes nçao dava suporte a qualquer coisa que pudessem,os precisar."
good,"How can one write a review on this company. To start all most all of the negative press that you see is true, the company vales money over customer service."
good,"It really is a tough job. Walmart has a lot of clientele, it ends up being a really strenuous job."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart involved great experiences, great customer feedback, and rewards.One of the skills I've have learned was to accomplish different tasks in a timely fashion. Management helped in areas where I didn't expect but overall I am still grateful for the opportunity. My coworkers were great team players and I enjoyed their work ethic. When it came to customer service and stocking merchandise, I felt comfortable with all given task. The hardest part of the day was unloading the freight and placing it in it's correct place. Even this task wasn't too difficult for me to handle. The only issue was whether the freight merchandise truck came on time and/or if we had enough staff to unload it."
good,"tyipical day at walmart is being a self-starter knowing your job and hitting the ground running. paying attention to management and customers is a must. management for the most part is good, as with any professional setting there are bound to be members of management that you clash with but its your job, be professional and work through clashes. sometimes you may have to work a shift alone and it gets hectic, stay busy and focused and you will make it through the shift."
good,Typical day here is like the people that I worked with didn't want to work when necessary until they felt like it. The employees didn't give me any problems at all but some were either lazy when they was present at work or didn't come to work at all.
good,"I've learned that people are really impatient and can be down right rude when they want their way.  Good or bad."
good,A good job for part time. Raise every year for good work performance.
good,"My duties stocker merhandises to the shelves,cleaning offices,breakroom,pushing the trash over the store,clean and windows,dust different areas os the store,zoning diefferent area of store,etc."
good,"Management is all wrong, all of the managers don't work together but their competing."
good,"They really didn't care much about their employees, not very understanding. I love my job and enjoying what I do. Just don't like feeling not appreciated."
good,"wal-mart was a good job to have , its a great company . you learn alot about retail and most of the coworkers are great , management was good to except for a couple of them . dont ever get hurt because even though they have great clinics they send you to for rehab if its a job related injury some will try to get rid of you ."
good,"Walmart advertizes itself as a company that cares about it's employees but they have yet to live up to that reputation. When employees ask for days off, the management that needs to approve it waits until the last minute to make a decision and then they have a tendency to deny your request saying that they won't have coverage for the position. They under staff the store and they also create ridiculous rules for areas in the store. This company really only cares about making money and will take advantage of you/"
good,Was very good job especially if you were a college student but it just wasn't the job for me. Didn't provide benefits and salary wasn't very good.
good,"get to work stalk bags on your register "
good,Most days were pretty good. Enjoy working with the public and helping them with the needs they have.
good,Over all I enjoyed my daily duties at Wal-mart.  I assisted customers with vehicle maintenance or parts needed.  My job included working outside in whatever weather so rain and cold snowy days weren't the best.  Management had a negative attitude towards their subordinates.
good,"Learned pretty much the full operations of a Wal-Mart facility. I worked with this company for many years. Within that time I was a sales associate, department manager, and support manager. I think the most difficult experiences I encountered working with this company was the unrealistic expectations required."
good,"A typical job and wage, nothing to get excited about. I guess the hours were good, but I would have wished the pay was a little better."
good,typical day at work would be the manager telling me I wasn't working fast enough to meet their standards which are outrageous to say the least. then I would end up doing my job plus some of someone else's job because they were to slow to keep then there were days where I would have to stock two isles with no assistance to be found when I had helped atleast everyone there atleast one time a night. the most difficult part of the is pitting up with the managers they are power crazy idiots who couldn't find their butt with both hands and a map.co-workers were amazing people to be around they would do just about anything to help if they could. the most enjoyable part of the job was smoke breaks just so you could get away from the managers for a bit. if don't smoke before you go to work with Wal-Mart you will most likely start smoking before you quit the job.
good,I changed tires and dropped oil for WAL MART in Fairbanks Alaska.  It was a good job since it was close to the University.  Kept me mobile and was the real beginning of building my work ethic.
good,"The employees are the real people who make the store what it is today. they are hard working, understanding, and awesome to work with."
good,"The job is good but the benefits aren't very good and the pay Is bad, just barely above minimum wage."
good,Very nice job for a first job. its consist of walking and stockin for 8 hours. The the hardest part is standing up all day
good,I loved working with the customers. The inconsistency of the management team was frustrating but overall the experience was priceless.
good,i would come in stand by the cash register and wait for people to want to check out
good,lots of gossip goes around and creates a stressful work environment if you don't have the ability to let things roll off your shoulder. Easy work and low pay it is what anyone would expect Walmart to be.
good,Walmart is a very challenging place to work. If you don't have people skills then you won't make it in Walmart.
good,"management not so good treat employees terrible "
good,"To sum up my job with Walmart, I loved the work but it could get stressful at times. I worked next to some pretty descent co-workers."
good,"This was a first time job, it was helpful in teaching me responsibility."
good,"Stocking the groceries and zoning them. You don't have to know very much to do this job. Management always checking and adding more work, but not more money. Never worked a place that you have to work 6 months before you get any health benefits or any other kind. The hardest part of the job is caring heavy cans and other things. For the most the co-workers are pretty good to work with."
good,"I liked working for Walmart. It was fast pace and the people where good to work with. Pay was good and we got a raise as needed. They gave me a ""mommy"" scheduled so that at the time I could be home for my kids when school got out. I would go back there is a second, if they where hiring right now."
good,"Overnight stocking in frozen food, meat and dairy products. There are team members to help get the job done, but you will be picking up slack for those not working as hard as you once you finish your tasks."
good,I was a senior in high school when I worked their made enough money for me to put gas in my car and go out
good,Typical day at work starts with assisting customers with their cars.
good,"I worked n the deli. t was fast paced and ii met a lot of people. the only bad thing that  have to say s that they are a corporation and with that comes a level of sneakiness. the managers of this store tried very hard to hide it but when you get laid off three days before Chrstmas because not enough money was made on Black Friday, it gets one thnkng. Benfts are poor, no overtime even f you had to stay late you had to leave your co-workers with a mess at the end of the week because you couldn't be on the clock anymore."
good,"I work four pm to two thirty am, I unload trailers all night long that contain small light box's or heavy box's which make for a long stressful night because heavy box's mean you're not making production for the night which means you're going to be written up. I have learned to do my job safely by using proper machinery. The management team is horrible, they lie right to your face and they do not care about their employees. The hardest part of the job is making production. I enjoy working alone which is the best part of this job"
good,I am a mom who went back to work recently and I was constantly scheduled hours that were not within my availability and every weekend. I worked 8 hour days on my feet stocking fresh produce for the consumers to enjoy.
good,"Cashier was my job very quick paced, fun job. Learned to be fast paced, to deal with un happy customers. Co-workers and managment where great and just as hard working."
good,I was a cashier while at Wal-Mart I liked checking out customers because it was something different all the time. However there was no place for advancement in this company as well as no full time being an option. I decided to move on to better myself.
good,wasnt my favorite place to work because management and supervisors playes favoritisms and was unfair.
good,Underpaid new age slavery is what it is and managers act like they are masters at a plantation. The claim to be flexible with school but that is the falsest statement made by far.
good,"helping the customers"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of eight and a half hour shift working cash, returns and refunds. We would receive two fifteen minute breaks and an hour lunch. Typically the store was always busy so standing on your feet for so many hours can be exhausting."
good,"Walmart is very impersonal in general. Direct managers generally come from within which can be nice and make direct supervisors easy to relate to, but as management goes higher, you can feel the distance forming. The low pay attracts two types of people, people who can live on it and people who are desperate for money. A general day on third shift is usually a fairly busy one of getting blamed for not doing everyone else's work on top of your own. Walmart demands a lot for the low pay."
good,Co-workers and management where excellent and they taught me a lot. Always had your back.
good,"A typical day at Walmart as a cashier would include coming in getting assigned to your register for the night and scanning customers items while chatting with them. Also cashiers are expected to clean the registers and surrounding areas when time allows. I learned a lot from working with Walmart. Like the fact that I want to go to school so I never have to work for a company like that again. Management was lacking to say the least. They wouldn't let me off for my high school graduation although I had requested off months prior and I remember it being the final straw for me to quit. I never thought I'd have to argue with management to attend my graduation. Co-workers were all miserable, constantly complaining and honestly that is why I started to hate working there. Everyone was extremely negative. The hardest part of the job would be working extremely understaffed ninety percent of the time. It is more stress on the employees having to pick up the slack because their aren't enough workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, they were extremely polite and caring most of the time and I looked forward to coming in to see my regulars."
good,the warehouse is small and you cant ship a lot of volume out while trying to maintain safety. so with on hand hours are getting cut.
good,I went on my own to learn what I needed to be promoted its a dog eat dog world and a lot of insecure people there in management. Regular co-workers would make my day enjoyable and I like working with the customers.
good,"Management.  Inconsistent approach  to employee relations in the stores."
good,"The typical work day would involve many phone calls (some not so pleasant), handling sensitive information (pertaining to patients, doctors, and insurance companies), filling prescriptions including controlled substances, and caring for patients in person. I learned how to care for those who do not like what you have to tell them, and how to go about my day multitasking. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help those who truly needed and deserved assistance. The best part of my job was working out complications with insurance companies and doctors offices benefiting the patients."
good,"A typical day at work would be running across the store to check on every department, Go through old freight in the back room and bring some of it to the associates on the floor, Help the associates stalk, put away and reorganize old and new freight. Clean and organize the back room before i leave."
good,"I can only rate the store in which I was employed.  "
good,"I enjoyed the job in the beginning,  I advanced quickly, and I was given certain tasks to complete, on top of my regular duties.  However, the longer I worked there, the worse the job got, on Cooperate level.  It became obvious that the company didn't care about the associates, It was all about money."
good,"I was a cashier.  Clock  in stand at register assisting client to ring up purchases.  collect money ,. provide change. Straighten products near register.  Assist clients in finding products within the store."
good,"Easy job. Just management isnt fair. They have ""favorites"". They favor some employees over others. For third shift stockers beginning pay is 8.45 an hour. Which is ridiculous. For everything the associates go threw and do for this company, the associates should be paid more. Co-workers for the most part are okay. I never really had much problem with any of them. I do however like the job, its fairly easy. I am a quick learner. And enjoy working. This is a hands on job, and very physical.Your always moving. Got to be quick on your feet. And pay attention to what your putting on the shelves as well as watching for customers. The breaks are good. The lunch is good. I'd rather not take a whole hour for lunch, but thats there policy."
good,I learn things every day.I think my typical day would be me walking in Walmart looking at where the meat is seeing what is missing and going in the frigerator or freezer to see if it is in stock and then find out what else is needed of me to do.The hardest part of the job would be when a manager takes me to another department to do other people's work and I don't have time to do what is needed of me in my department.The enjoyable part is just seeing the customers smile when they get what they want .
good,AT the connection center my job was to help customers find the right phone for them. and a contract that will work for them. I t was fun to help find the right phone for the person.
good,A typical day at work is just a regular 9-5 standing at a register all day. Pulling in customers on slow days and dealing with attitudes because of false advertisement. workers are lazy management is ridiculous. they are never around when needed.
good,"i work over night, it is usually slow. i am a cahier/stocker once it slows down around 12 am . the hardest part is working overnight because i have a baby and it is hard to stay up all night. the most enjoyable part of the job is my fellow associates and customers."
good,"Working at a retail pharmacy has it's ups and downs. For the most part, the day stays busy/steady. But unfortuantely there is not much advancement. I enjoy the team I work with and my direct management is awesome. Because it is retail, I directly work with my patients face to face. I feel like it is my time to move onto a hospital setting because I would like to make this job choice my career and take it to a professional level. There are days where some of my customers are inpatient and rude, and because I am ultimately there to serve them, I have no choice but to be professional. But I also feel I don't deserve the verbal harassment I sometimes get. One of the perks I have at my job is making as many costumers as I can feel happy and satisfied. Yes, I do have some regulars who know me by name, and look forward to seeing me when they visit the pharmacy once a month. Those are the people who make my job worth while and help me forget how rude some people can be. Not just rude, but getting older and having to be on maintenance medication can be stressful to some, and I always want the customer to feel that I care for them, and show them as much empathy as possible, but some people are just not nice. So I am ready to make a professional move by working in a hospital setting!"
good,"Management doesnt communicate well which puts you in a situation where your trying to do two to three jobs at once to please every manager that walks by at the same time. If your a male and you work evenings 9 times out of 10 your going to be in the warehouse unloading with the unloaders. The co-workers are too messy everyone talking about everybody else's problems instead of worrying about their own. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that you have a one hour lunch and in most cases to "
good,It was an okay place to work . The managers weren't the best equipped for the position . The co-workers were pleasant . The hardest part of the job was trying to voice an opinion or concern . The managers just did not want to listen . The most enjoyable part of the job was the fast paced environment . I love where there is enough work that i don't have to slow my pace down . There was always something to do .
good,enjoyable work enviorment. co-workers always friendly and helpful. Hardest part of the job was leaving at the end of the day.
good,"I was a cashier. was fast, and demanding during the holidays. the people i worked with were nice. The manager at that time was not good, never had scedule right, ended up getting fired for stealing. the hardest part of the job was they never hire full time, and your scedule always changed."
good,My experience with Walmart is very neutral. You have long days with lots of missed breaks and poor management support. Employees are often crossed trained without proper compensation and upper management often mismanage hours to the point where the store cant support customer volume and satisfaction. I enjoyed working with my fellow associates and have many fond memories.
good,"I loved working at walmart, it was very good for me. It showed me how to deal with tough situations with customers."
good,"working for walmart has been challenging with low pay, it was fun working with customers and learning how to check produce. but the job is seasonal and i am looking for new career"
good,"I was ready to leave Wal-Mart. Their pay and benefits were only for managament and you could never work yourself towards full time. When i was put in as department manager, I got thrown into the position without applying and wasnt received my benefits or up pay. Then with me in college they didn't want to work with my hours, which forced me to choose between my job or my edcuation and I choose my education. They almost wanted you to be somewhat a slave and only think about nothing but them and their company."
good,"A typical day at work was very good when the store was filled."
good,"The company rarely offers full-time positions to employees, therefore there are no benefits offered. There are little to no opportunities for advancement because it is based on seniority."
good,"Although the people you work with are amazing there are those who love to cause problems. I enjoyed my job however I was underpaid, and overworked.Hours are cut here and there and they sometimes remain that way! Unreliable because of the hours. They cut people down to only a few hours and then turn aroud and hire 8 to10 more people."
good,I have learned alot from my job like good customer service my co-worker are easy to get along with when we work as a team the hardest part of the job. Is when we don't communicate to get the task done on a appropriate time.The most enjoyable part of the job is to interact with customer.
good,"Most of my days are long and stressful being pulled in 10 directions at once. Management for the most part acts like they care about morale, but everyone goes in circles since no one is on the same page.  All theycare about is how the store looks on paper never actually implementing anything from the ""suits"". Teh co workers are fun. They hardest parts of the job is running five department with no assocs. and mgmnt expecting miracles. The most enjoyable part is my co workers."
good,I was responsible for ringing up customer purchases while being on alert for shoplifters and quick exchange scams. I had a heavy workload but it was fun and made the day go by. It was a great job for me while in college.
good,it was ok but the pay wasn't enough for the amount of experience I had.
good,"I have enjoyed my experience at Walmart, and the advancement came quickly and easily. However, there is a lot of frustration in regards to the Home Office making decisions that do not necessarily work for the Store's area and culture. Also, there is a huge lack of training throughout the store."
good,"I hated the management, never wanted any one to move to full time"
good,management sucks if it wasnt for the other employees this job would be hell
good,"managers yell at you, customers yell at you.. their is no winning.. save yourself some time and find somewhere else to work please..."
good,It  was a fun place to work. I learned the cash register in 2 days of watching how it worked. The hardest part of my job was the rushing that some customers did.
good,"My typical day at work includes greeting customers, working the"
good,"It was a fun job.  The advancement to lower level management was quick, however it was made clear to me that any further advancement would not be forth coming.  "
good,The job is easy to keep but you don't make a lot of money and it takes forever to get benefits. My coworkers are good people but a lot of them are lazy due to discontent with the employer and working multiple jobs to make ends meet.
good,I took care of customer needs. I worked in customer service.
good,walmart has become a very unfriendly place to work they changed there ways of treating people
good,Walmart maintains a surface facade of responsibility to it's employees with policies that sound reasonable on paper but in practice are anything but.
good,"Lazy Management, lack of communication , everybody on different pages"
good,Le clients a toujours des question et je suis la pour réponde à sa question du mieux que je connait .
good,"a typical day at work:- Fast pace, very hard"
good,"Greeting customers, assisting Customer Service Managers as needed, lunch/dinner breaks are provided, but notoriously later than planned.  Having open availability allows for advancement when applicable."
good,"As a walmart receiving associate i would unload merchandise and deliver it to the sales floor to be stocked. Once the trucks were complete and all merchandise is in the proper location I was either assigned to helping stock merchandise on the sales floor, inventory overstock merchandise, or clean the receiving area."
good,"Great place when I first started, but managers where constantly being replaced and changing things as they came and left."
good,Priorities were always shifting so fast that no one could keep up.  Managers constantly complaining about things beyond our scope to control.  Lots of employee arguing and back biting.
good,Fewer people are being constantly driven to do the work of more people. Everyone stays angry because of unfair work loads. All managers show favoritism. Vacations are the most enjoyable part of the job if you can actually get one approved.
good,well to be honest it needs improving but it is a fun place to work at
good,A typical work day you would stand around for 8  hours and have brief interactions with your customers coming through the line.  I didn't really learn anything because it mostly just stuffed that you could use at a grocery store like the numbers on the fruits and vegetables.  The hardest part would've been standing there all day bored or dealing with rude customers.
good,"Typical day at work are 8 hour shifts or shorter depending on the time of the year, spring/summer being normal 8 hour shifts, and fall/winter being 10 hour shifts or longer on 6 days a week."
good,Clock in get your instructions for the task at hand and complete all task in the time allotted.
good,Xmas time you are over work with out your right breaks. And they are always look for ways to keep there money.
good,Hard company to get promoted within unless you have connections with others within the company.  Usual annual raise of 10 to 40 cents.
good,"typicall day serving customers"
good,"It is an okay place to work, Management isn't too accommodating at times and doesn't really seem to care about its people at all. The benefits and pay are great and I have fun working there."
good,"A typical day at work for me is normally a 9 hour shift. I go in and punch the clock then I begin with assisting customers. I do a variety of different things. Anywhere from cashing checks to just assisting with any questions or concerns. Surprisingly I do tend to learn new things almost everyday. At my job the rules change so much that you have to keep up. On a day to day basis management can always vary. With management comes different personalities so you learn to adapt according to who you are working under for that particular day., I absolutely love my co-workers. They make my day go by quick, while at the same time making it a friendly environment. I would say the hardest part of my day are dealing with the unpleasant customers. However I know and understand that they come first and are always right. what I do enjoy are seeing my regulars. The customers who come in and brighten my day. Those are the people I look forward to seeing."
good,"a typical day at work involves zoning,unloading roller racks/freight,answering the phone transferring people to the right place,even a little cashiering from time to time.i learned how to cashier.my management  were very strict mainly about business,but overall my co-workers were very nice,and outgoing."
good,I ran the front end of the store and there I was in charge of all the cashiers and was to make sure that everyone left happy
good,"Constant transactions and updated sale prices, providing information and recommendations to customers, effective response to upper management and stock and inventory.  I gained knowledge for electronics.  Management and co workers provided positive examples.  The hardest part of the job was keeping regular hours.  The most enjoyed part of the job was online comprehensive testing."
good,"-A typical workday would consist of stocking shelves, culling food, unloading trucks, and assisting customers."
good,I really did not like working here. I gained experience but I didn't like the department I was in and it seemed unorganized
good,worked in the garden center taking care of the plants and flowers
good,"I learned function in a gemini gun.My typical day at work is stocking shelves,temps and helping customers. Management is good, and my co- workers are great to work with."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"La empresa tiene asociados con experiencia, sin embargo el cambio constant de gerentes afecta la operacion ya que cada gerente tiene su manera de ejecutar procediemietnos lo cual aun cuando Deben ser los mismo parametros no se evaluan o miden de manera equitativa ocasionando desjuste en cada cambio de gerencia, lo cual no permite un balance en la misma empresa."
good,started by getting the work order from computer. then performing tasks giving. co workers were great but the hours on third was bad. which was also the worst part of the job.
good,"Um trabalho que desperta uma vontade enorme de efetivar."
good,"I was not pleased with the management decisions of handling employees care and concern; therefore, I don't have much to say about my experience with Wal-Mart."
good,"Job became mundane after a short amount of time. Although the company states leader in logistics, employee insight/recommendations were taken halfheartedly. A great paying job for a physically demanding career."
good,"Came in and was immediately pushed into everyone else's work, what they didn't bother to finish, on top of everything I had to do; it was never enough."
good,"Is very busy workplace, multitasking, customer service."
good,"My work schedule at Walmart was 10pm-7am almost everyday.  At first it wasn't that bad, but eventually I would end up staying over every morning until 8-9am.  I have children that had to go to school, I would have to call my husband and he would have to leave his job to come home to make sure that they were ready to go to school.  Also I am enrolled in college online which requires a lot of time as well and with me staying over all of the time, having to sleep so I could go to work and do it all over again, I fell behind on all of my classes.  I also wasn't seeing my children hardly at all because I would sleep then get up and did the same routine, I just couldn't do it anymore."
good,I was not happy while working there. The only great experience was being able to help my customers. I did not enjoy seeing my co-workers.
good,"Arrived early to pull out-of-date items from floor."
good,A good job to have starting out in the work field. And many opportunities to do different things.
good,Easy to get a job. Management knows your just a number and they treat you that way.
good,"A typical day at work started with a meeting giving us an idea about daily sales and how many pieces of freight to expect on the truck on a given night. At the end of the meeting we would be told which aisle we were to be working and how much time we were being given to work said aisle. After leaving the meeting the employees were expected to work together to sort the freight to the aisles before beginning working on their own. Once in an aisle we were to take the freight to its location on the shelf, rotate it close dates were in front to be purchased first, then 'zone' it to make it look good. Any left-over freight was to be placed on a 'rocket-cart' and sent back to IMS to be binned. Employees were expected to help other employees finish their aisles once finished, and if any time was left after that, help IMS bin."
good,I enjoyed working with the company and with the people. It was a quick paced environment and i learnt a lot.
good,Enjoyed assisting the customers and meeting new people daily
good,Great place to work but it does get quite stressful at times. The managers expect so much from certain people and babysit others but hey that's life.
good,"Typical day come in, review tasks to be done, and start them. As day continues Salaried Management will interrupt and change current task, add on over the top tasks until stress levels overwhelm all the associates and dept.managers. This happens on a daily basis, and has for the past 4 years. Best part of the day lunch and punching out. Enjoy working with co-workers & dept. managers. Hardest part of the job trying to please to many bosses. I feel the need to give more than humanly possible."
good,"management has a habit of being haphazard "
good,"I worked in Electronics selling high-end Televisions and computer equipment. "
good,Everyday was a new challenge.  Have to balance customers needs and wants with management's directives.
good,"Limited room for advancement - when I took a test to advance to CSR from cashier, I was instead shuffled into a different department. I saw many other cashiers taught how to CSR without the actual title change so that they would not gain the pay raise associated with the different level of work. There were too many days where my department was understaffed for the amount of work expected of us, especially since we also were expected to step over and assist customers in the adjacent department in which we had no training."
good,Enjoy working with the people and the majority of my job. The hardest part of my job in the last year has been the hours that I have been working and not seeing my family.
good,"Stress builds up everyday. Management successfully makes it extremely hard to complete any sort of tasks because there are very few associates, too many managers, and only one of you. They give multiple tasks that need to be completed in a very short amount of time, they don't care what you had to do, they care about what ""they"" asked you to do. I enjoyed my co-workers, they related well to me. I learned a lot of new skills which will hopefully transfer over in the future. "
good,"I tryed hard to get my work done. Keep to myself. I'm will focused."
good,Your jobs are not always accurately described to you. Management doesn't like to work or help you with your job or questions about your job. Benefits are horrible and advancement isn't that great.
good,"I was hired through a temp service to do a remodel at Walmart and our whole remodel crew was treated horribly. Walmart associates were rude, unhelpful and didn't do their own jobs. "
good,"had good management when i first started. we would throw baby showers in spring, had santa at christmas dressing up for holloween  just a lot of fun. great people to work with."
good,This job was a job i got out of college and needed to pay my bills with. I just cashed out customers and helped them find what they needed. The management made it hard for you to move anywhere inside the company because it was hard for them to to move up. The hardest part was dealing with management. The most enjoyable was the job itself. Talking and helping customers out.
good,"Don't get me wrong, I love wal-mart. I enjoyed the time I worked there. I think that sometimes, people that have huge companies such as Wal-Mart, handed down to them, put to much politics into the job"
good,good  place  to  work  if  you  cant  find  something  else .friendly people
good,"OTJ training, but low moral, very little room for error, clicks everywhere, no appriciation for your work or for going above and beyond"
good,Although I was not with walmart long I did enjoy my time there. Being that I worked overnight I did not get as much interacton with customers as I'd like. The company itself is a good place to work. The thing I liked most was the relationships I developed with my co workers.
good,"I loved to interact with the customers and speak with them."
good,"A typical day at work for morning shifts would be:"
good,"I would go into work at 4 a.m. and get off work at 12 p.m. everyday. I would only get a 30 minutes for lunch. I made any were from 250-500 donuts a day, then help stock the floor in the bakery department. The hardest part of the job was i had 2 to 3 hours to make all the donuts. The most enjoyable part of the job i got a 10% discount at Wal-mart."
good,"You will never have a consistent schedule when you work there.  More often then not you will be pulled from your job to do something completely different than what you were hired in to do, and in many cases it will be a higher paying position.  You will receive no compensation for the pay difference."
good,What I learned was how to deal with customers.The hardest part was dealing with customers that had complaints.The enjoyable part was selling good products.
good,Not a bad place to work. Money is money. It just wasn't the place for me if you want to advance in the work place. Some coworkers were alright. Mainly rude.
good,To be honest walmart was fun the ppl was fun I love interacting with customers hardest thing for me was when I was working in the freezer dept. Ridiculously cold.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. The entry-level associates was a blast to work with and I remain friends with many of them. I've always been a team player and enjoy working in groups. There wasn't anything that management couldn't ask me to do to help out that I wouldn't do from pushing carts, door greeting, maintenance, in stocking or carry-outs. Management just didn't appreciate the hard work of their associates. Sometimes it was tough working there because of a shortage in supplies or poor schedule planning. But overall it was an amazing experience."
good,im learn to clean kitchens and my co-workers are a good friends
good,"When I get to work I check all my outs on the shelves and place orders where needed, if the product is in the freezer I pick it so that my employees can stock the shelves. I do counts on products and do price changes. If there is a modular to be done than I start that. I also go to supervisor meetings and store meetings. I work with vendors when they need help with the products that they service. I also help in other departments when it is needed. I keep a running inventory on all the products that I carry in my department."
good,Company is a pain to work for because they don't follow their own core believes
good,"A typical work day included receiving a task list and being able to complete it in a timely manor. I learned how to use the hand-held store wide computer system, and how to operate several different types of electrical lifting equipment. The management there was fair for the most part and were usually willing to help with any questions or concerns the employees may have had. The hardest part of the job was having to redo work that required heavy lifting, due to managerial mistakes. The most enjoyable part of the job was working the register on the front end of the store because I am quick, polite, and accurate, and I always received positive feedback from the customers and improved their shopping experience."
good,Walmart should pay their workers more starting out than they do right now   with items costing so much now this is the reason their pay should rise
good,"Not so bad if you want only a part time job. However, if you want full time, you have to either be a friend of someone in the office, or fight tooth and nail to get full time. The hours are all over the place and if you don't get what they want you to get done, they belittle you and say your not working hard enough. The pay is alright, better than minimum wage."
good,Typically very busy. Some co-workers are more helpful than others. Hardest part of the day is when trying to zone or put things up. The most enjoyable part of the day is assisting the customers. I've learned how to multi-task all throughout the day.
good,"Good for getting the experience, will cross train, co-workers were friendly. I enjoyed intereactions with customers"
good,"Walmart is a great place to work for a while.  It is not a life long company.  At first everyone is polite and helpful, however; after a year or so the atmosphere changes.  People that have worked there do not like their jobs and feel trapped.  The management are pressured to perform to impossible standards and this pressure is a trickle down effect to each and every associate.  I do not believe that this is any one person in the store, but a problem that stems from the top, company wide."
good,"As Department manager I  was responsible for all new hire training in my 4 departments.I also worked on store planning and design,inventory control,pricing and marking down of merchandise, loss prevention. I am a very service focused professional and a team player."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy. we were on a time schedule and had to work very quickly. I learned a few more customer service tips, how to unload a truck and how to work with customers and still maintain my back room job duties. the management at wal-mart was okay. we didn't have the best instructors nor the best workers. management in my personal opinion wasn't the greatest. my co-workers were at times very lazy and didn't want to do their jobs. the hardest part of the job for me was pulling pallets to the sales floor. the pallets where very heavy and it took a lot of strength to pull them to the sales floor. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and helping people when help was needed."
good,"It kept me very busy."
good,You will not have time to anything in your personal life. They are not flex with your life at all. Can not change schedule for 6 months they say but really they wont let you unless you bug them all the time and possibly talk to the store manager.
good,hard to do your job as they keep changing you job duties on a daily &/or weekly basis.  Some managers haven't forgotten where they came from & are doing a great job while others have let their position go to their heads.
good,"Going to my area and checking the shelves for product and restocking helping customers working on projects with co-workers "
good,"A typical day at work consist of a fast paced, customer service oriented workplace. "
good,Lots of employee complaints from the moment I walked in. it was employees complaining about management and other employees . I learned however how to wax floors and buff floors. The hardest part of the job was that it was overnight
good,"A typical day would be, coming in to work, dealing with unhappy customers who were in a rush, informing customers that there was something wrong with their vehicle and letting them know if we could fix it or not. Preforming oil changes, tire rotations, flat tire repairs, and constant cleaning of the work areas. Co workers were lazy and poorly trained. Hardest part of the job was dealing with co workers and their lack of work ethic. Most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out at the end of the day."
good,"if a manager doesnt like you for any reason including how you look, you will loose your job soon."
good,"Always on the go, Management is all about Customer service and taking care of your employees."
good,"managers control everything, which is good or bad, they can hold you from being promoted, they can also make you promoted, it's a very ""hold you back"" environment, good if you are just trying to get experience doing something though."
good,I enjoy working with my management team. We treat each other like family and communicate with one another well.
good,The hardest part of this job were the customers. Some customers would act very irate. The fast pace was what I loved about it. The swing shift was what I disliked  intensely.
good,"•	Greet and assist customers"
good,"I liked the people I worked with. They were very friendly. I was a seasonal employee. When the season was over, they just dropped my off the schedule, no warning ahead of time."
good,"This is a good place for a first job for a teenager. Other than that Wal-Mart encourages negative coaching instead of positive reinforcement. It's good job security, but has a high turnover rate because of the negativeness of the company/employees."
good,my day consists of decorating cakes and putting up freezer products. the coworkers are great people and everyone gets the job done
good,"Management does not value employees"
good,"Typical days at work were relaxed, i learned to be on top of my game always, management sucked, co-workers were helpful and cool. Work wasnt hard at all, and the most enjoyable part of working there was getting paid."
good,"A typical day at work involved myself doing my managers job and getting paid what an hourly employee makes. The only thing that i learned was customer interaction. As far as management goes, I dont agree with the way they treat their sales associates. I asked for a transfer and put in for one several times on the employee webpage and got none. I asked for probably a minimum of 6 months while i was pregnant driving an hour and a half one way to work every day. My co workers were very friendly, i have nothing bad to say about co workers. The hardest part of my job was the commute i had to make every day since they refused to give me a transfer. the most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the employees and customers in my department."
good,Look work hard and they will want more out of you so work everyone else's pace and you will be safe. If you get a good manager help him/her to the best of your abilities because you can trust them. If you get a bad manager clench your teeth shut and make it through the day.
good,"This job keep me busy I was able to go from a cashier to learn different areas of the job worked as a customer service manager worked in the money center, and did lots of customer service and front end help overseeing cashiers get them money and counting drawers and the safe so the over all experience was great learned a lot. But the down side to working for Wal-Mart was Management allowed me to work in various positions but didn't pay me according to the position I was For filling  still receiving cashiers pay not very fare and then I got sick and they wouldn’t allow me to work light duty so as a result of that I was fired so I relocated here."
good,"While working in the pharmacy I have learned how to speak clearly and calmly to customers and fully explain myself, even when they are irate.  Furthermore, I have learned valuable knowledge and experience in filing prescriptions, deciphering doctors' handwriting, navigating insurance billing, and the entire prescription filling process.    "
good,I work a 8hour shift. I learn that you have to take a job with the public one day at a time. Most of my management is good. I like working with all of my co workers. The hardest part of my job is when I get a rude customer. I enjoy being able to meet some of my new customers and seeing some of my regulars.
good,"Days can be different but the same.  Some managers are better than others.  If you do your job, you will not have any problems.  My co-workers were great though, I learned a lot about people.  Hardest part of job is the never ending changes in policies. But it was a good job.  The benefits are good if you can get full time they are great.  "
good,management is full of cocky people who act like cops. The pay is terrible.
good,"Management is horrible, usually understaffed, and low wages"
good,the customers aren't that bad but they're sexual harassment policies need to be better inforced!
good,"Alright, long hours, many ways to cheat you out of your money. Very nice people, very nice co workers, flexible with school or other job schedules."
good,"Information meeting ."
good,"Walmart is always on the go.•	Communicates and responds effectively to Customer questions about automotive services, locates"
good,"A typical day at Walmart is simple. Clock in and check out customers. I have learned time management, and how to maintain ethical when dealing with customers."
good,There is all ways something that needs to be done. Never a dull moment.
good,2 Pharmacist store one works the other is a diva. Which mean the techs have to do more work when she is working 
good,"work is being pushed to the work place.. fast past!"
good,"I personally don't care for the job. A typical work day isn't challenging, at all. You have a few good managers there. All in all, most of them just use what little authority have to bother you. I did gain good customer service skills while being employed here. "
good,Management at this company do not uphold their leaders or follow up on problems in the work areas concerning the associates.  They do not take the time to make sure that everything is done according to the rules and regulations of the company.  
good,"A typical day at this job is normal as others, however, the management team has recently gone through a lot of changes and in making changes the company has no clear sense of direction for employees to follow. Recently there have been a major overhaul to the policy and procedures, resulting in quite a few firings this summer. Change is inevitable and if you are looking for a company with growth as a major focal point, then don't apply here."
good,trabalho todos os dias de segunda a sábado no horário pela manha e nos domingos escalado de plantão  aprendi como é o processo de logística no geral e como desenvolve-lo com sucesso.
good,"I've had several problems working here since I started in 2011. When my mother passed suddenly March 2013, I was given little sympathy and when my father became ill just months after, I was coached for missing work that FMLA wouldn't approve. I also suffer from CVS, an invisible illness that makes me become violently ill for seemingly no reason at all...I have been called a liar by management who accuse me of making up my illness to avoid working. "
good,A typical day at Walmart start with backroom meeting to see at everyone task going to be. task usually included inventory counts for backroom and sales floor and scanning any merchandise from truck with wasn't scanned night before.
good,"i enjoy the work and associates i work with i just don,t feel that the company attitude of respect for the individual is practiced by all. this causes and uneasy working atmosphere"
good,"I provide customer service on a daily basis. I've learned a lot about inventory processes, as well as ordering processes and how to run a department in a retail setting. The management team is understanding and accommodating in most situations. My co-workers make my days at work very enjoyable, they definitely make the work atmosphere enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is probably those times when I don't perform to my personal standards and I am toughest on myself. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers and being able to do what I can to make their experience shopping with us the best that I can make it."
good,You can advance to higher positions if  interested. You must be willing to work in any department and help where needed. Most of the employees have a team minded attitude . Hardest part of the job is the  schedule and balancing family life.
good,Worked with a great team of kids and management team which made my job easy when coming in and setting the cinema up for the day which meant checking for burnt light bulbs or old posters. Then I would check the theatre for broken seats. My crew would start counting and setting up the concession stands for the day. I would walk through the projection booth turning on the projectors and checking bulbs. Then open the building once everything was all set.
good,I believe that for most Walmart with be a launching pad to something else but in the mean time the atmosphere depends on you. If everyone does their best to bring positivity to the workplace it would be a much better place to be for all.
good,"Clock in to work on time, go to the front end of the store to notify your manager that you are on time, and will be starting your job. Go to the closet retrieve your safety vest, go outside to the parking lot, and begin to collect the shopping carts. Place all shopping carts back in their proper areas cleaned and ready for the next customer to use. Greeting customers are a must do as they enter the store and when the customers leave it is also a must do to thank them for their services and time at Walmart. I have learned how to deal with different kinds of people and how to assist them with their needs to help expedite their process while shopping in the facility. My co-workers were an enjoyable group of people. They create a positive work environment but as with all things there are some that choose to try and dampen your mood. I would have to say there was not been a problem that passed by me that I couldn't solve or that gave me much of a hard time. The best part of the job for me was interacting with the different customers at Walmart on a daily basis and I say this because helping people is my passion and gives me my motivation to do more."
good,walmart is fast paced and it allowed me an opportunity to support my family.
good,"I write out of dates in my log. I pull out-of-dates and donate them or throw them out. I stock product and help customers. I bin merchandise. I clean the floor, sinks and drains at the end of the night. "
good,Great Company for advancing further within a company. typical day at work consisted of giving exemplary customer service and also learning hands on skills and applying practical knowledge of pharmaceuticals. Great upbeat coworkers that encourage also assist in anyway shape or form. hardest part of the job will be parting from it and the most enjoyable would be clocking in to atomosphere of productiveness
good,"Walmart was a decent place to work despite what people say. They paid a reasonable amount and I was able to be myself in that environment. The only thing I didn't care for was all the gossip, the lack of training, and the lack of communication between managers. Besides that, I learned a lot about sales and customer service; both what to do and what not to do. "
good,"It was very interesting from day to day. Being I was supervisor, I dealt with many different problems and situations on the daily. Varying from customers to co/workers. I helped at the service desk doing MoneyGram, Cashing checks, Returns, Money Orders, answering phones. I kept busy by making sure everyone (cashiers, service desk associates) was properly stocked and kept a clean envoirnment. I frequently gave out loans ranging from $200-$6000. Basically where ever I was needed, I could pretty much perform the task."
good,"Generally a day at work will consist of coming in and breaking down the new pallets that were delivered to the store that morning and filling the floor with stock, confirming that all produce is the freshest. During my time at Walmart I have worked in a few departments. I started in the second shift I.M.S process which I would start the day unloading the truck or trucks that had come in that evening. while I did that, I learned where most everything in the store was located. Each box had a shipping label. That shipping label would tell the department and aisle location. That is how I would know which pallet to put the box on. I then shortly after moved to the first shift I.M.S. that is where i would travel the back rooms of all departments and count each item. I would scan the bins per department and would perform audits. this portion was the most time consuming process of the day. after that had been completed, I would then start setting up for the second shift so that when they came in they could immediately start unloading the truck. After the set up had been completed I would then move to finalizing my count screen. The count screen is where all the departments  that I audited would show up and if anything had not been audited it would be the final step for the day and the audit would bee on this screen. I learned that without these counts the store would go haywire. This was all so management could see what we had in the store as well as the department manager and if anything was low or out it could be ordered. It is very important that an accurate count was taken so that"
good,I liked working for wal-mart but the benefits weren't the best and it left little time for my family life
good,"Attend meeting, gather work for area assigned, stock shelves, clean as you go, zone areas and go home."
good,Every day we got a load of freight in and we would have to stock and bin the excess. 
good,some things where a real downer like the management is always on your back and you get in trouble very easily and they don't really consider how troubling it is to be asked to do things that are not in your department at anytime of the day whether or not you know how and get belittled and in trouble for doing things wrong. Its like you have to kiss up to make a difference with your advancement. 
good,"The store I worked at was pretty decent. Working in the Auto Care Center, we had a pretty tight crew, where everyone got along with each other and there was plenty of work to keep us busy. Granted, there were rules and manager decisions which made no sense to me, but I was able to use my own judgement to get the job done. Over the years, I became good friends with a lot of my customers, to the point they wouldn't deal with any other associate unless I wasn't working that day."
good,i miss working there i quit because they could not move me and i was not getting along with someone
good,Too many people wanted to lead & no one wanted to follow management rules. Cart machine doesn't work properly & sometimes you be on the lot by yourself having to push carts by hand during rush hours. 
good,"I go in from 8-5. When I arrive I make sure payroll has processed and start on my typical duties. The hardest part of my job, management that can not do anything for themselves, the best part, seeing someone excited about their job."
good,"The only thing I bettered myslef on by working at Wal-Mart is the process of going through a Fuel injection Cleaning, and I also bettered my service writing skills more by getting experience in it."
good,"stresseful job bad kids,no structure and management steals money and gets hired back"
good,"This was probably the worst job I have ever had. The management here was quite inept, which based off of other Walmarts that I have see, may very well be a company policy."
good,"Good co workers,great inventory system. Benefits not so good"
good,"▪	¬Took care of displays"
good,Very physically demanding and many times stressful but if you can accomplish getting the job done day by day and stay around for a year plus the sky is the limit for you. You simply have to be or become mentally and physically tough to keep up. At the end of the day this job was a blessing and I am grateful for it and the experience
good,"A typical day of work is getting busy right away.  It's a busy place to work, a lot of things need to get done so you have to be very efficient at everything you do and a great multitasker if your up at service desk or supervising.  I'd start my morning off by punching in and going up front right away.  As a front end supervisor I have to make sure the cashiers that are scheduled are here and at the right register.  Anything a cashier needs, they type the code in at their own register (bathroom break, change, propane refill, training question, ect), and I would go get it or do it for them.  If the register lines get long, it is my job to find back up cashiers or if I’m able to, I hop on a register and help out.  I also work up at customer service a lot.  Any transaction that is done at the service desk, that is not a usual return, I have to be there and okay it by turning a key and typing in my password.  I do a lot of returns, counting money, cashing checks, cashiering, putting away returns, price checks, and making sure my lines don’t get too long.  I deal with a lot of customer issues, such as not being able to price match something or not being able to return an item.  Being courteous to the customer when telling them you are not able to do something is very important in my job.  You have to know how to talk to a customer and try to help them in any way you can so your able to fix their problem to the best of your ability or you have an upset customer.  I also keep in touch with management quite a bit in one day to make sure the customers leave happy, I’m getting the help"
good,"Walmart is an ok place to work.  Not the greatest, but ok.  I'm sure each location varies, but our management staff was pretty good, but we were always understaffed and overworked."
good,"My typical day at work was being at work and being there with my friends, they were not just another person to work with, they were my friends. I learned not everything is going to be easy or hard, control attitude, how to work hard at a certain speed for one job duties so you can work just as hard on your other job duties. Our manager would work with us instead of sitting down or doing whatever, they would work with us to. They help solve problems before taking it to another level, like taking us to the bosses office. They helped us and teached us when we asked for help. My co-workers were nice and fun to work with, they also help rotate positions in our job or help you with that job. Pulling really heavy freight and not having enough people at work was the hardest part of the job. The enjoyable park of the job was getting two 15 minute breaks and 1 hour lunch break. Also hanging out with the guys between the breaks but we also have fun while doing our jobs too."
good,"At a retail store, good management is key to a good work environment. Some of the Managers at Walmart were good, some were bad. so it just depended. I really liked my coworkers. we got along really well."
good,This was strictly just a job. The company itself could care less about their workers. 
good,Walmart is a very busy and hected place to work. The hardest part of the job is picking up someone else's slack. The good part of the job is there Is always room for advancement
good,"Customers were always fun and nice. I learned better customer service and patience. Management was except able. My co-workers were great and very welcoming from the first day I had started. The hardest part of working at Walmart was the rush hour. The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart was meeting new people, seeing that I was new to the Tucson area. "
good,Each day was a different experience to come across. Diverse customers and employees each shift and work day.
good,cashiered all day and restocked and zoned . sometimes moved around and helped out in other areas would have liked to bounced around a lot more.
good,In Wal-Mart you have to come to work with a solid focus on getting through the day. Make sure you aren't easily angered because the management's mindsets are not all on the same page. So what the actual procedures and rules are could be over rode at any moment. Just come to work with an open mind and the day will fly by. Making yourself smile is what it's all about.
good,"unfriendly management and co workers"
good,"My typical day at Walmart began at 7 am.  Initially, enough staff were hired for a new store,  As time progressed employees were expected to do more, fill in for vacant positions and work in areas the employee was not trained in.  For the most part, management was good.  There are some good policies set up.  My coworker were great -- all hard working.  The hardest part of the job was getting products stocked with so few people.  The best part was the interaction with the lovely people who shop Walmart."
good,"I come in at ten at night, we have a night shift meeting, the manager tells us what section we stocking, we stretch then get to work. We grab carts in the back from the trucks and take them to our sections. We have to 2 15 minute breaks and a hour lunch. When I am done with my section I clean my area and go help other people do there sections. The hardest part was the lazy people. My managers knew I would be done early, so they come get me to help. I enjoyed some of the people I worked with here."
good,I was able to come to work at 5am and get my job done by 2pm and avoid the terrible summer heat. At the age of 57(at that time) this was important. The lawn & garden dept. was very hot to work in.  The people were great.
good,"I had many responsibilities at wal mart.  Waiting on customers, working on their cars, using computers, and stocking dept. were just a few of the responsibilities I had. I learned how to manage properly by watching good managers and comparing them to the awful ones.  "
good,"Working for Wal mart was a good experience ,learned alot about the company and about myself ."
good,I was hired for one position and performed many operations. Management and my co-workers were wonderful to work with however there seemed to be to much micro-managing. Standard procedures and operations could have been directly better to make good use of time and getting merchandise to sales floor.   
good,"Bentonville Ark directors should improve their standard with corporate social responsibility. Sure owe to the shareholders, but don't kill off the people that help you stay in business. Also the supply chain is pretty deplorable with the sweatshops abroad."
good,I liked that i worked alone in the frozen dept but sometimes the workloads were like 12 or 13 hours of work and i would have to bust my butt and would get help with it until the dairy guy finished but that was my only hassle.  Some managers were annoying and over aggresive.
good,"I started by checking my tasks and picked up the base boards first. Then I continued to stocking the merchandise onto the shelves, zoned area , and also cashier when things got to busy for cashiers to handle alone. Thee hardest part of my job was binning the merchandise back in receiving."
good,A lot has changed since Sam Walton passed away. Now it is just a job. Few if any employees have pride in their store or this company. 
good,"Been a Customer Service manager. Management I would under was good. Some folks are good but a lot of backstabbing and in work drama. "
good,Very busy place with lots of customers and long lines. It would be so busy that to get help or price checks you'd have to take care of things yourself due to not getting help from leads.
good,"a typical day at work would be answering the phones, maintaining and stocking merchandise, helping customers. While working at Walmart, I learned that patience and consistency is the key to get through any type of situation or day. My co-worker are awesome, the most enjoyable part about my job was making customers happy."
good,A typical day at work can be very stressful. I learned that their values have changed dramatically. I do not believe in the ways that management treats the associates. The hardest part of my job is pleasing my store manager. The enjoyable part of my job is working with my associates.
good,"Good first step into the work force, but not something I want to be doing long term"
good,"A typical work day would be 8 hour shift. Steady work pace and hard work. Wal-Mart never has the amount of Cashiers needed. Co-workers are good. Management is okay some are just not a people person, most had favorites. "
good,This is a great place to work if you want to work retail. I enjoyed the family like relationships I had with my fellow co-workers. It was hard to advance and management would pick favorites. The hardest part of this job was working on the first of the month and on holiday's. 
good,Walmart was a great place to work for when Sam Walton was alive. Then it changed entirely. There became too many rules. No job security at all. 
good,Like the work schedule. Hardest part of job is all the manual labor and long hours though. Pay is decent.
good,"Questionamentos apenas pelo cargo que exerço, pelo fato de ser discriminado as vezes pelos próprios colegas. No demais a Empresa oferece condições minimas para para satisfazer o funcionário, como alguns benefícios tipo sala de lazer, plano de saúde e etc."
good,Walmart is a company that offers fast advancement however you must be cautious and think of all the pros and cons. 
good,"A typical day as a cashier at Wal-Mart was mostly busy and enjoyable. I learned that if you have an upbeat attitude, then customers are easier to please, and it makes work exceptionally less stressful. Managers were caring but firm and tried to help their employees as best they could. In my expirience, my co-workers were friendly and fun, however still professional. The hardest part of the job is when you have upset customers, and they lash out at you for something you have no control over. The easiest part, was just enjoying the customers business, and having fun."
good,"Liked my job, just had a manager that wasn't even part of my department tell me that I wasn't doing my job when I was. It was distacting."
good,"It seemed like no one in management cared if you had a question. Besides that, it was a decent work place."
good,Enjoyed being able to assist customers in finding things. My co-workers are funny and will turn your bad day into a great one.
good,Working for Walmart was fun but yet very challenging. Day to day you had to be prepared of all kind of personalities that you would encounter.
good,you do more work then the managers and at times you do manager work all on a minimum wage salary
good,"It's a very well run company, were always very busy and there's always so much to do. I've learned a lot here working in the dept I do. Homeland security has really taken over as far as money transfers and money orders go, I have to pay constant attention to the money transactions around me. The hardest part of the job is probably when I come face to face with a person laundering money and I have to do my best to avoid conflict. I have to say the most enjoyable part of the job is helping my customers whether its saving an elderly couple from sending 8k to Canada due to a scam or offering someone the best advice to getting their bill paid on time. I love that kind of stuff."
good,"unload trucks, put merchandise on shelves, and do inventory"
good,A regular day involves the bulk of my job completed as a Dot Com associate in a couple of hours. I would then move on to other tasks that required my assistance while still maintaining my Dot Com position which was assisting customers with the items they had purchased from Wal-Mart's online shopping website. I learned a lot about the inter workings of retail and how some of the business is conducted. I disliked lifting heavy items but i enjoyed making the customers day better.
good,"Every aspect of daily operations in every store in the US, from wages/compensation to product placement to personnel scheduling, is controlled by the cooperate office. Customer service is second priority to the bottom line. On the whole, the company is corrupt and fiscally irresponsible."
good,there will be a manager on you all the time and never happy with what you did even if your ahead always wanting you to do more and if you cant do it their way you will be threatened with your job
good,"• Performs audits and completes audit reports by counting merchandise, researching variances or discrepancies, identifying and accounting for shrink or overages, and adjusting inventory counts."
good,"job security working for large corporation, they offer many services to employees and community, however did not receive health benefits/raises as promised. all cashier hours cut significantly."
good,"it was just a fun place to work,got to learn how to use different equipment to do inventory,or help in different departments even when other employees would call you back to help"
good,The hours were inconsistent and the management was very poor
good,Prepared cash bags for associates. Helped out at customer service desk processing returns. Operated cash register when required. Processed deposits daily.
good,"I was a cashier at wal-mart for 5year, I interact with a lot of customers. And having a positive attitude is a must. I enjoy the peple I worked with and serving the customers."
good,"i would usually help customer out wit bills, money center etc,"
good,the management is not so good their values and priorities are all screwed up and their is no communication between people in the store.
good,I come into work and go to the computer to check my staffing for my numerous areas. When i am done with that I have to generate the trucks that are coming into the docks to drop off merchandise on the computer and assign personnel to trucks.
good,I wish Walmart would be more family friendly to single parents with young children in school and have no help to support and help their struggling children in school with their school work.. A typical day could be fun. Management is kind of cool they really don't be on your back all day.
good,I had worked for them for 8 years and had learned how to work in a lot of different departments. And because I did I was pulled daily from my job to work every where else. Even after they had set pay grades for each area. My own area could be busy or I would have a list of things to do from my Department manager I would still get pulled and get in trouble the next time I would be at work with my managers.
good,"working at Wal-Mart for me was a learning experience. it was my first time being a cashier at a store such as walmart, especially because my every move was monitored. working at WalMart gave money handling experience, it also help improve my people, and communication skills. even though good hard work, or improvements are not reconized as they should be. I set personal goals that helped me, professionally."
good,"did not work the job long due to the face that is was seasonal, but the time i spent there was great. loved interfacing with the customers, helping thme find what they needed. and getting the in and out of the line with excellant customer service"
good,The people you meet 90% are great
good,"Responsible for four sub departments in domestics (furniture, bedding, bath and home décor). Doing price changes, floor plans, employee training, sales, product investigating, price beating , daily audits of departments, stocking and binning merchandise."
good,"I found WalMart to have underpaid employees and offer very meager benefits after a year of full-time employment. Although you were required to give them a span of hours you were available any given day, they rarely stayed honored this guideline."
good,"I've Worked My Way Up With Walmart . I Had To Go To Over Nights For More Opportunities, The Results Have Been Slow."
good,I learn how to deal with upset customers in a respectfull in friendly manner. Customers are your #1 goal to stastify
good,"After working here a year, I realized that there was no future for me here and pay was not good at all. I received a raise after my one year evaluation."
good,I enjoyed my coworkers..Also knew what was expected of me and did it to the fullest extent..
good,"Uma multinacional de grande porte, onde ha muitas possibilidades, de crescimento profissional, pena que a direção da mesma nao esteja de acordo com as diretrizes."
good,"Customer service with any help customer's needed. Loading and unloading trucks, stocking shelves with products, and selling products and services to customers. I learned great customer service skills here. The management here was good and really cared about their employees. My co-workers here were fantastic and good people. The hardest part of the job was the volume of customers at times. The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with people everyday."
good,Lots of work to do. Many things to learn. Managers need a dose of realitity. Co workers are nice helpful and easy to get along with. appeasing management. Satisfaction of a doing good job.
good,"Approximately 20 hour work week, Friday through Sunday. Constantly busy with customers at cashering. I get along well with my co-workers and customers. I enjoy working with the public. I've learned alot about cashiering and enjoy working at diffent registers. The hardest part is working only weekends and staying on my feet all day, except for breaks and lunch."
good,There is a lot of favoritism. There really isn't any time if you are sick.
good,lucky if you work a full day. Lucky if they dont call you and tell you there is no work for the next few days
good,Loved my co workers but there were just to many head chefs in one building
good,"management only looks out for themselves promises stuff but never does it, work place isnt very happy. Alot of people come and go, very hectic."
good,"Typically, you either work A LOT or you don't, depending on manager on duty and shift. For the most part, management is kind of lackadaisical unless it really affects them or they are in a rush to get something done. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the difficult customers. The best part is the good customers. Go figure. Co-workers range from very responsible and effective to very irresponsible and careless. It's easy to be noticed but quite difficult to advance. Favoritism plays a HUGE part in everyday activities."
good,"very large store,hard to know your co workers, working 3rd shift was hard."
good,Walmart is a good place in a lot of ways but its changeing and some of the old workers are worried about their jobs
good,Many scheduling issues create stress for alot of the associates and management staff.Also affects customer service to the point of customers going elsewhere.
good,"A typical work day is random you never know what your going to walk into. The number one focus should and is with me customer service, however due to lack of staff and poor upper management in our store it can be a challenge to balance the tasks at hand with customer service. As far as my equals in my area and the people i supervise they are awesome people. The problem however is the uper managment is somewhat un effective in my store."
good,"trabalhar em equipe,nao houvir o fucionario na hora de chamar atençao ficar gritando com fucionario."
good,"I enjoyed working For walmart, I were well trained to do my job and complete in a timely manner to reach production. Met alot of great people ."
good,it was a nice job but cut thort. the company took care ther people paying what you was worth now they pay min wage for long hours an noy anuff help people wait to long for thangs to grt done
good,"Not the best company to work for, of course it has been many years since I have worked for a Walmart I worked in the jewelry division with our own management and regional managers. I was processed claims, ordered merchandise and received new inventory. The store managers never seemed to be able to run the place correctly. Walmart is a company I would never work for again. Pay is low, benefits are terrible. I did like working with the public and enjoyed my co-workers."
good,This company is alright to get started in the retail business and aquire whatever skills you can gain to advance into the position you are striving for.
good,work is OK depending on who you get to know and don't let the job or coworkers stress you out.
good,i wont work for again manage is just a pure pain most don't know what they are doing and the ones that actually care are strung out so far that they cant help you.
good,But after 15 years I could never seam to move up no matter how hard I tried It didn't seam to matter
good,"I am greatful for the experience I have gained while working at Walmart. A typical day is quite busy and sometimes frustrating. We are stretched to get a lot done with not enough time or resources or pay. I believe their is not enough staff to get the job done right. I have learned that I have to get what I can done and let the frustrations of stress that comes with it go away. Management has had its ups and downs. I have seen good managers come and turn bitter and leave the company. I have seen some bad managers also get better and change. I love most of my co-workers as they are the reason I look forward to coming to work. The ones I have worked with have helped me to change my attitude about situations and I have helped them do the same. The hardest part of my job are the schedule as with all retail, it is not a ""9 to 5"" job but whenever they need you. I have a family and cannot be with them at times I need to be and want to be."
good,Good overall. I love my job and my customers.Exceed the company and the patients expectations.
good,"Coming to work with a smile and winning attitude and being ready to see the customers. I learned how to develop my communication skills and verbal skills with customers. The mangement is averge and has it reasons beyond my knowledge. My co-worker are more ambitious to seek their success as I do. The hardest part of my job could be the customer is not happy and not knowing the reason, until i figured it out. My primary goal is having anyone who may need my assistance and take pride and joy in it while i do it."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting people from all walks of life. I have learned plenty of skills for almost every department in the store. I would have to say the least enjoyable is that the store is often short handed and that I, as well as other employees, are often pulled to multiple departments throughout the day to fill in for the employees that they were lacking. Also management is unable to use basic communication skills with each other as well as with their employees."
good,one of the customers get s in line with an attitude.i watch my managers work hard to keep things in prospective.hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers.the most enjoyable part of the job is going home at the end of the day and my days off.
good,"low pay, managers are not nice. do work that is not in your job description."
good,fast paced ever changingwork place where no 2 dayd are the same
good,I didn't like the work environment at Walmart at all. Some of the employees where rude and very unfriendly. It wasn't hard work if you could keep up. I didn't feel that I could go to the management with issues that I had. I felt like they would judge me and think less of me.
good,Plenty of multi tasking had to prioritize duties during the day.
good,empresa de grande porte e difícil comunicação com a gerência pois a gerência ficava em outra cidade
good,"Work at your own pace and don't worry about what others' do while on the job. Working overnight is great, I love the atmosphere when the end of a work day is about to round up."
good,A typical workday is an eight hour shift with an hour lunch.
good,"A typical day at Walmart consists of walking in checking my task assignments then getting started. If I happen to be scheduled in the shoe department then I usually have to zone or straighten up the department before running any freight that may have arrived on the truck the night before. Our management team is pretty goos. They will also run freight, zone and put up returns like anyone else in the store. My co-workers for the most part are great. There are some that get by with not doing much which doubles my work load, but it's up to management to figure that out. The hardest part of the job is dealing with those that refuse to do their tasks. By them not doing what is required of them it puts alot more stress on the rest of us that do. The most enjoyable part of the job is my discount."
good,Empresa com grande estrutura de apoio às atividades rotineiras e processos.
good,My typical day would start off as I would come in do returns. After the return I would scan my out and make a pick list of products. Then I would started stocking products.That the easy part. If you ask me the hard part is deal with upper management from home office because by them not always in-store they cant really judge how the store should be ran. My most enjoyable thing from that job is the people they were great when you get returning customers.
good,"Unloaded 18 wheeled truck, completed inventory by using a scanner to pick materials that were needed to be on the floor such as tools, equipment and miscellaneous products, stocked using the following equipment; walker stacker, pallet jack and forklift. Cleaned work area using proper cleaning Wal-Mart standards. I learned how to work well with others and be a team player and follow directions. I worked with a diverse group of individuals. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy merchandise and being on a 2 hour time frame to get the truck unloaded. The most enjoyable part of the job was stocking the merchandise."
good,"This business would have been a lot more enjoyable had it not been for the rather awful management. There was a lot of ""drama"" that was stated on a weekly bases and nearly impossible to just avoid. The job itself was rather enjoyable being able to work in the back, unload trucks, and stock the store were not hard nor mind numbing. There were some good co workers and a lot of bad ones."
good,How to check people out and how to have good customer service
good,"I have worked fot 11 years with walmart. Their wages towards associates were handed out unfairly. Someone with less years or experience would be makeing either the same or more to someone who's been there longer. Had no respect for the individual. They didn't hand out any good jobs or rewards for hard to to everyone. They had their favorites that received the special and non deserving credit. The only thing that have kept me there that long was the ability to transfer to different locations across canada and depending on the location to different area's of the store. They also don't go by senority for promotions nor if that person has more qualifications. I liked working with customers and with the staff. The management team at my last location weren't team players nor helpful with training. I have learned more from other department managers than the store managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the steady monday to friday 7 to 3:30 shift, free coffee, some of my fellow co-workers and helping the customers! I haven't had asked for a raise in my whole working experience and when I did before my 11 year review I was denied. I was making less than $12 an hr, so I asked to be raised and matched to the other 10 year associates that were working as a department manager. I was also on a maternity leave and willing to come back sooner but the store manager never got back to me or was willing to work out a raise with me so there for I went in a gave my notice to the personal manager. Wal-mart has a ""No Quit Policy"" and that's when the Store Manager will ask you what are your"
good,vejo o está faltando na aréa de venda faso um rascunho de tudo que precisa fazer e mãos a obra.
good,"Loved working at walmart I worked there part time only. Checked customers out I also worked in the money center I handled money orders and sent,received money al over the world."
good,Typically my day was just gathering shopping carts in the parking lot or helping customers load groceries or taking out heavy loads for the customers.
good,Walmart used to be a place I thought I would like to work at because they were family oriented. That is no longer the case.
good,co workers very helpful / enjoyed working in automotive dept.
good,"They over hired so they're firing people from left to right, and they lie just to get people fired. They tell you to break the rules so you can get the work done and when you do, you get into trouble and get fired."
good,"Job was easy, training was helpful, hire for only temporary so job length is not that long."
good,"Um trabalho de 7 horas + 1 de almoço. O respeito pelo individuo, um bom atendimento ao cliente, responsabilidade com a empresa e pontualidade. Os colegas e a Gerencia é uma equipe boa de trabalhar. Parte mais difícil, não ter tempo para estudar, e parte mais agradável uma equipe bem unida."
good,My experiance at Walmart has been trying at times. I arrive at work and work the overnight shift as an inventory control specialist. Hours are often cut even though I am hired as full time. And the schedule times change week to week. I learned from management that we can do more work with less people. My co workers are related to each other and we often have conflicts at the store between people . The hardest part of the job is trying to complete the task at hand when management keeps asking if your done yet? The most enjoyable part of the job is free doughnut friday every two weeks.
good,"A typical day at work consists of taking customer returns that are either defective are that they do not want. Making sure I am working I n a safe and accident free enviornment. I learned alot of impotrtant things to do with financial services and money services. In the beginining the management team was good but now the management team now does not treat there associates right. Some of my co workers are very pleasent to work with I""ve created many bonds with some of them. The hardest part of my job would be not having enough staff to work with. The most enjoyable part is working with my co workers."
good,"Operated forklift and scissor lift heavy machinery, prepared orders of all purchased store goods, ordered inventory and supplies according to company needs, supervised the unloading of incoming stock from transportation companies."
good,"Typical retail management job, Customer service manager handles a lot of jobs that can be fairly stressful, very fast paced."
good,Some people are friendly
good,A typical work day is pretty busy nothing i cant handle. I learned alot about working in a warehouse and all the electical equipment.
good,"Come to work accomplish your tasks and go home. There wasn't any sense of unity. Everybody looks out for themselves, they just want you to keep your head down be quiet and do your work. Aside from the managers the sales floor associates are usually very nice and humble people."
good,"Not very well organized, also problems with some machinery."
good,Its not that great. The mangers have no respect for alot of the cashiers.
good,"a empresa tem alguns atrativos, não é ruim, apenas não oferece boas condições, como uniforme completo, possui um recurso humano fraco, demora pra contratar, demora pra mandar embora."
good,Was fun working the tire and lube dept. the hardest part would be having to work it by yourself it is defiantly a two person job.
good,"The year I spent at Walmart was more than I expected and almost more than I could handle. With the constant hassle of working at swift race combined with the unhealthy overnight shift I found myself being hospitalized. The heavy lifting, the work environment, the health risks and manager attitudes was the deciding factor in my decision to remove myself from their company. Time and time again I was met with shift managers that refused to cooperate and compromise with even the smallest of requests. The extra dollar from working overnight was not worth it in my opinion if it came with daily migraines from stress and body pains from the work load. The pay was decent. But I did enjoy the other employees that felt similar to my disposition. But all an all I have no regrets from my entire walmart experience at all. It was a life lesson and I can always appreciate learning something new."
good,Stocking and sales and learned about different types of batteries and management is good co-workers are great there are no hard parts in the job most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers an customers
good,I worked in the pharmacy part of walmart and the people I worked with was awesome. The pharmacist were not to big on me because im a talker and love to keep everyone laughing but work at the same time. Aslo working in the pharmacy there are alot of security breaches so you have to be very careful. I liked that I felt like everything I knew was top secret and I had to hide it from everyone. I loved talking to the customers but the thing I hated was all the people that worked there being treated differently. Either you were treated like a queen or you were treated like a fool.
good,The work would be fine if you weren't uncomfortable in the clothes you're required to wear and if management would keep enough staff where one employee wouldn't have to do the job of 5.
good,"On a typical day I unloaded 2-3 trucks a day with poor equipment and no concern for safety of the employees from management. I was a safety team member and when I tried to bring areas that needed attention I was quickly shut down or ignored. When I wasn't making orders for new shipments or unloading trucks, I worked individually at stocking shelves with grocery merchandise and was used as a floater to work in other areas of the store when needed. Also, I worked as a cashier in different departments when needed as well. The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability and freedom to work efficiently on my own."
good,Stocked shelves
good,Is a unorganized workplace where the managers do not communicate well with each other. There are never enough registers open to tend to the customers needs to get them in and out. They are not the least bit concerned about the well being of their employees nor customers. Some employees can be very unfriendly and uninviting. The hours are great and you will make 40 hours or close to it. sometimes breaks and lunches are forgotten.
good,Poor pay scale. Limited advancement opportunities. Co-workers generally nice. Work is often tedious and physically exhausting.
good,loved this job decorating and operating the deli was very structured but the job wasnt fullfilling. no advancement was offered a raise. it just wasnt enough. i needed benifits.
good,"Typical day at work was stressful. Management lacks management skills. Many managers are sleeping with employees against company policy, and coincidently they are moving up the ladder. If it makes sense they don't do it, and they don't look out for the employee."
good,"Walmart expects a lot out of their overnight crew, sometimes a little too much. I can be a very stressful workplace. The most enjoyable part of the job is some of the co-workers."
good,I started there as a cashier. i was great until the first year term. i never got a raise until three months after. I got insurance benefits right then. the manager was really nice! the problems i had there were a)a coworker who always got away with being lazy b)I always closed c) customers are so rude thereis always a problem and I usually got stuff thrown at me d) I never got any breaks as it is law
good,"Helping customer's is number one thing at walmart, even though i am an assoicate and i am suuppost to be on the floor, when cash gets busy they page me to go up and help and i do."
good,"Not only do you do your job, you are also required to do everyone elses too, We are well under staffed and the only concern are managements bonuses"
good,"Surtout le soir la semaine et le jour surtout fin de semaine.Le travail consiste à répondre aux clients,faire couleur pour peinture,placer le stock.Nous avons quinze minutes de repos pour un quart de travail de 4 heures,"
good,"I greatly enjoyed going to work at Wal-Mart.. I worked in the Sporting Goods section maintaining the sales of firearms along with the paperwork and background checks associated with the sale. Management was very helpful at most times, however, the management rotated out what sections they were in charge of. This sometimes made it difficult for them to assist in certain areas and was left up to the associates to make up the difference."
good,Walmart would be a great place to work if the managment could get on the same page.
good,It is a good place to work but the hours are not that good and they are not consistant. Lots of people are alot of fun. You meet alot of good people. Seeing the customers are good. Some are good and some not so good but that is the retail business.
good,Came in and started on the cash register. The management team was not around. The supervisors we some what helpful but they seemed to be agitated most the time. It was fun at first but I realized I had no room where I was going to advance in the work place
good,these guys really care more about their customers then the people who have to assit them & get there money smh will never there again
good,"For the holiday seasonal time that I worked for Walmart, it was a good experience overall."
good,Wal-Mart seemed to forget about individual needs. It seemed as though they reminded the employees that there were several other people in line for their job the moment any one asked for a specific day off or specific hours. The only good part of the job was getting to interact with customers on a continuous basis.
good,I enjoyed working there; I have a disability and the late nights were stressing my body out even more and I started sleeping all day. I asked multiple times to have my shifts switched and all I got were my hours cut. That was not what I wanted.
good,Was fortunate to get a full time position before they started cutting back newer workers into part time only. Some people would call out on us and leave us hanging or not even call at all occasionally. Mostly involved stocking shelves with products from the backroom. Find things for customers.
good,"A typical day at work would be to clock in, get into a task for the night on the employee computer, then I would go to my aisle to stock merchandise. I typically on an average receive 10 hours worth of work that I would have to complete within a 5 hour basis. Then I would have to zone the aisle for 2 hours to make sure it looks good enough for the customers who come in to shop in the morning. I didn't really get along with a couple of the managers. Not that they were bad people or anything, but that they were not particularly satisfied. They often time wanted us to do aisles with a lot of work quicker than the anticipated time that we were set to finish. Sometimes I would have an 11 to 7 shift. With 10 hours of work, they would ask could I get done at 3 or 4 instead of 7. Its really hard to accomplish that especially on an aisle that has nothing but can goods. We also didn't have oppurtunity for advancement, nor did we have an incintive for our performance. Sometimes the hardest workers get passed over for positions for people who just started working over people who have worked hard for years. They also didn't offer us employee of the month or any incintive for performance. Our bonuses normally decreased by weeks. Our bonuses are based off sales. We went from having 200 dollar bonus after the quarter, but by the time we got our check, the bonus had decreased to 60 dollars. We got bonuses once a year, but we only received 40 cent raises."
good,Walmart is a compnay who has fallen everysince the owner passed. The company is no longer family oriented and the treat the employees and managers like dogs.
good,"O Wal-Mart me proporcionou um grande desenvolvimento profissional e pessoal, agradeço muito por isso. Mas estou em busca de novos conhecimentos, experiências e oportunidades."
good,Benefits cost more than you make. Customer values are high while associate values are low. Job security is there but advancement can be difficult. Management wants to run the store thier way not the Walmart way. I most enjoyed working with my fellow associates and the customers.
good,"A typical day at work consists of coordinating a variety of safety and security procedures. My jobs main responsibility is to make sure that the environment is as safe as possible, and if an emergency does occur all associates are prepared for immediate action."
good,"I started working at Walmart Guelph in 2008. At first it seemed like the ideal place to work. We were always busy and the promise of advancement was enticing. I quickly learned that it's not what you know it is who you know. Our management team included some of the biggest liars that I have ever met. Mind you, not all of them were terrible. When I was first employed, our store manager was a great guy. He was always upbeat and would tell associates that they were doing a great job. We got a new store manager in 2009 and all went to down hill from there. He immediately had favourites, even ones that didn't work hard like the rest of us. He threatened jobs and as I said before, the biggest liar."
good,a typical day at work i would be stocking merchandise and zoneing the floor to be sure our selves are neat. my managers are hard workers they not only assign us work but they also are hands on workers. their are only 3 other associates that work with me they are all females and we get along great and work as a team. the hardest part of my job is not being able to satisfy every customer. the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to assist my customers with their needs.
good,"Wal-mart was a decent place to work. They worked around my school schedule and important instances in my life. They only worked me part time at about 33 hours a week. I was ineligible for benefits. A typical day was setting up my area, and talking to many customers. I learned how to effectively talk an irate customer down to a calm customer. Management was not very involved in their employees. My co workers were great. Everyone got along with everyone. The hardest part of the job was the holidays."
good,.Working on all equipment
good,If you need a day off you can easily get the time. They allow you to call in for sickness or emergencies with no questions asked up to so many days. Almost everyone has a positive attitude and is very friendly. I put open availability so my schedule is constantly switching from morning to evening shifts. The pay is not very good.
good,I was a cashier so it was frustrating especially with angry customers.
good,"not much hours, really not a good chance to move up in the company, u have to do everything the managers tell you, Your just another body to them, but i was in the garden center and it was pretty easy work, the managers liked me because i didnt complain and did everything they said. Most weeks was part time work so not much hours unless if its next to the holidays. Also u dont get benifits if you work part time until you have worked there for two years... the discount card is nice though"
good,Everyone there is very nice. The work is not really hard but it is hard on your feet.
good,After clocking in I went to my assigned register and scanned customers products and bagged them. Sometimes I would be a greeter while they took breaks. There are many managers at the store and not enough employees. The managers did not seem to be on the same page with each other. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet for long hours. The best part was interacting and talking to people.
good,"Poor scheduling, almost no employee loyalty. Poor work conditions with limited staff scheduled per shift."
good,"Everyday was very busy, you never knew what department you would work in or what task you would be assigned, or who you would work with. I learned the task management time program, the new inventory control system. Most of my co-workers were great and so were the managers. The most difficult part of the job was always being short-staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interesting people."
good,"If you need flexibility in schedule, they are good for that; however, workers are not treated fairly and even under paid for the multi level of jobs you do."
good,"A typical day was clocking and running register for 4-8 hours of the day working as a cashier and helping elsewhere if was needed like the Customer Service Desk. During my stay at Walmart I learned different areas of the store, Customer Service Desk, Lawaway Dept, and the sales floor."
good,there is no team work what so ever if employees try to have team work they are emeaditaly dispearsed top management are the only ones that are not struggling just to pay rent not to say you still gotta buy food and pay bills and what if you have a family that needs things like clothes and food and hygeine things
good,A typical day was busy and fast paced. I've learned patience and customer service dkills. I love my co-workers great people to work with. The hardest part of my job is when the mamgers pull you from different directions and ask you to do something for them. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers.
good,"A typical day at work involves interacting with customers to provide customer service, stocking inventory and daily projects. It is a fast-paced job that keeps you busy. I have learned how to quickly adapt to different situations as tasks change frequently."
good,It was alright to work there. I liked having the discount walmart card for me and my wife and benefits.
good,Always being judged on what you wear by the other groups that work there. i would come in and do my job the best i knew how and there was always another employee who would try to bring me down.
good,"Excelente compahia , pena que alguns gestores não respeitam os valores propostos nas politicas da empresa"
good,"O período que trabalhei pude adquirir muito conhecimento, pois devido a função que exercia, consegue aprender um pouco de cada setor. O trabalho que eu fazia era muito desgastante, devido estarmos sempre com falta de funcionários. Onde faltava um alguém tinha que cobrir, tive muitas vezes que trabalhar mais de 12h para não prejudicar certo setor, na verdade eu fazia quase tudo menos realmente a função que constava em minha CTPS. O salário era muito baixo e não compensava todo o esforço que tinhamos. A parte da gerência era muito fraca, não sabia lidar com o dia a dia da loja. Mas apesar de tudo as pessoas com quem eu trabalhava diretamente me ajudavam muito e nós sempre fazemos a diferença, mesmo sem sermos reconhecidos por isso."
good,My typical day is not over whelming or to hard. I learned a lot about fresh produce and other little tasks in my department.
good,very busy
good,"When an experienced eyecare professional is on the premises, WALMART has the ability to provide outstanding products and services."
good,A typical work day for me would to arrive at work @ 5:30 am ready to zone and stock and items that needed to be restocked. I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart and I learned that you have to fight for what you want and stick with it.
good,i don't enjoy working here it is just a job I am working there till I can find a job that I went to school for.
good,This was not the job for me. Typical day at work was very long. I learned that Wal-Mart doesn't appreciate its associates. Co-workers are friendly and pleasant. The hardest part of the job is dealing with so many unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the one-hour lunch break.
good,"very fast paced environment, meeting new people and helping customers"
good,Maintained inventory control
good,"The managers would routinely intentionally understaff departments to cut costs, leaving the associates who were there to struggle with trying to assist customers with products that they have no knowledge of. The coworkers were mostly a joy to work with, but management seemed to be self-absorbed. The benefits were above average and got better for those who stayed with the company for many years, but too many associates got burnt out due to the fact that they were always feeling like they were being pulled many different ways to make up for the incompetence of management. At one point, the turnover rate at my store was over 60%, so they had to effectively hire 3 people for each position just to find one who would stay. The hardest part of the job was the fact that there were many days that I could never get a break until I clocked out for lunch/end of shift due to the fact that, at the time, noone else could do my job. The best part of the job was the people, both coworkers and customers. I learned more from some customers than I did from anything provided by the company."
good,"It is best to work in a store where the labor market is half way between tight and too many people out of work. The easier it is for Walmart to find employees, the less management cares about employees."
good,Clock in at 3;30 am run a fork lift for 11-12 hours
good,Good place to work if you are single or a student. People with family and bills to pay find it hard to afford having just one job.
good,Management was a little hard on people. I work hard at this job.
good,"Although the corporate office in Phoenix is a nice place to work, Walmart lacks a decent benefits and time off package for hourly employees. Please know that within your 1st 2 years of employment, you only have 5 vacation days, then you only have 2 weeks off until you've been with them for 5 years; your 1st sick day is never paid - it actually warrants a loss of a day's wages; co payments on the HMO health plan are very high."
good,I spent alot of time at a register and facing item in the electronics department.
good,"I have been working at walmart for almost 2 and a 1/2 years, not only am I still only making 8.65/hr but it is also almost impossible to move up in the company. A typical day at work for me would be to work on freight, and make sure things are straightened up. Along with being treated like a child by my department manager, who doesn't know how to be a manager. I've learned quite a bit working at Walmart, but unless I planned on moving to another Walmart, the things I've learned I couldn't take with me anywhere else."
good,Typical day involves getting lists of notes from every level of management above you all expecting their tasks to be highest priority. Then taking those notes and attempting to either perform them or delegate them to entry level associates most with little to no work ethics or desire for completing tasks.
good,"Printing, operating system, printers, delivering reports, fixing PC's, prainters, install and repair cables, help other areas if available. Deal with top management and other warehouses and home office if needed on a daily basis. My immediate management was a good person. I trained her to be my boss, while the upper management had no clue how to operate or know any aspect of a computer system. Their iadea of fixing a downed system, flip a switch. Not that simple! And I took complete charge to show what needed to be accomplished. the hardest part of the job was upper management and the benefits which almost didnt exist unless you are upper management. the enjoyable part was my immediate coworkers and immediate boss"
good,"politics,make ya try to stay under the radar..I learned to make sure you get it in writting.Hardest part of the job was grinning and bearing it. Most enjoyable laughing with coworkers."
good,This is a very flexible place to work. I have enjoyed the family in this company.
good,great learning experience.. Management was ok too many layers of management. Great employees. It was fast paced working in a perishable foods area.
good,"Working at Walmart consists of stocking and zoning the sales floor, changing features/endcaps. Going to assist the front end with cashiering during busy hours, maintaining the stock room and assisting with unloading the general merchandise trucks when short staffed. I learn many sales quailites while working there and good customer communication skills. My fellow co-workers were all very nice, enjoyable people to be around, some of who are still every good friends of mine. Working with my co-workers was usually the best part of the job, any time you needed some help with something you can count on one of them to be there. Working the holiday season is usually the roughest, lots of frieght and some long hours, but inventory time was the hardest time. Theres lots of counting and straightening out of shelves and stock rooms, and lots of hours that go into inventory. My favorite part of the job was doing the new shelf mods, they were time consuming and kept you busy."
good,"Unloading the trucks was always fun, got to talk with good people and the equipment was in good shape and worked well. Management wasn't that great and job security was horrible."
good,Quality of the work force; both hourly and management need to be reacessed.
good,"always a new learning experience. Enjoyed my customers. always excited to learn new programs, and this company was changing things in the pharmacy a lot. Always like the challenge."
good,"Tiene desventajas y ventajas, como toda empresa si aprendí muchas cosas. Como tratar con clientes y ventas en marketing tipo de clientes. En fin muy interesante."
good,good job security and okay management. The pay wasn't great. Health insurance was too expensive to afford.
good,I pushed carts at Walmart. I still shop there at least once a week. I quit the job because I went to Basic Training.
good,Working mornings is always easier. Day goes by faster. I learned to be more situation aware than i already am. And that you cant take everything too serious.
good,Es una empresa de buen prestigio solo que a veces no tienes a los jefes correctos.
good,"I check if dishes or ovens or slicers needed cleaning .If busy help a customer.From this jobi I learn customer sevice I enjoyed this part of the job.I found work at Wal Mart they expected you where to hard and if you made a mistake you where to blam ,and this was not always the case.To much gossip from some of my co-workers and with customs,tasks not completed,so closing workers had more work.Standing and cuts meat more than two hours at a time,some of my co-workers diddn't do there job ,so rest of us had do their work.Customer sevice meet people."
good,"The managers will never stand up for the associates who are making them look good. You have no one to stand up and fight for you when the time is needed, instead the managers, rather write you up and no question a decision they feel is not right in their hearts and minds."
good,Wal Mart was a good and friendly place to work but it was only part time work and promises were not kept about full time later on and advancement
good,"I have learned a lot from Wal Mart, from merchandising to store set up and cash office skills as well as operations."
good,"Its a good job to have, if you can take the management style. Just don't get on their bad side. They say you can take a problem that you have with your manager to their boss, but that just get you into more trouble then its worth."
good,"Walmart was a indoors job . im more of an outdoors type person, i like seeing new things everyday . Walmart didnt allow that."
good,- typical day was unloader trucks
good,"A typical day in walmat was verifying precription orders and counseling patints on medication and performing MTM services when needed, The mangement was good, MY co workers were considerate and understanding, The jobs was good I learned to develop some clinical skills"
good,its like being back in high school all over again. The third shift workers are the ones that make it funny and some what close to saine to work there in the store.
good,"My daily duties consist producing large volumes of freight in a timely manner while adhering to strict quality requirements. My department is loosely managed because due to its large size; I work with 50-60 people daily. Strict management is not required because every individual has specific assignments which require little or no assistance from the management team. Many of my co-workers have been working alongside me for many years and have truly become my work family. After working ten hour shifts, four days a week for many years, family is the only term that seems appropriate. The most difficult part of my job would have to be the work conditions. The facility in which I work has no air conditioning system or heating system. Therefore, extreme heat and cold makes the work place difficult and uncomfortable at times. In addition to poor working conditions, the opportunity for growth and advancement does not exist. Despite, my knowledge and experience I feel like I have flat lined. I am seeking a career not just another 9 to 5. I want to make a difference in the lives of others. The most important and most enjoyable of my job is customer service, making sure customers always have access to good quality products."
good,Has the potential to be a great place to work but management has their hands tied.
good,Love to work at Walmart fun and busy place. Sooooo busy that at time you are not able to get your own job done!! They have a great family culture and have a chartity program that is wonderful
good,the unloading process of the deliveries of the day while managing the staff an merchandise. Assisting customers also other associates to make sure that they have ther assignments for the day. The hardest part of my ob is looking for the staff wto assist with all parts of the store.
good,My typical day at work consists of me unloading Freezer/diary loads from delieverd trailers. After load is complete i down size pallets of frozen product to be stocked on the floor. Once frieght is done i am responsible for managing over stock in inventory. I label box's then put them in organized form in bins then enter upc's in inventory systems. Management Doesnt take initiative to personaly know or care for there employees. The hardest part of my job is working my self to the bone and being under appriciated. The most enjoyable part of my job is fellow co workers who have an understanding on how to accomplish tasks properly.
good,Would have to get out of school early since I was always schduled to come to work at 2pm before school got out.
good,"My typical day ay Wal-Mart consisted of clocking in, going to the shoe department and straightning up that department. Once that was finished I would cover the jewlery department while others went on lunch break and and after that I would cover the apparrell and I was responsible for making sure that was in order and neat.I was also called up front to cover the registers and the front door. After being employed there for a while, I was moved to inventory management which involved counting product and making sure it was put in its correct place. If not, it was my job to correct it."
good,"A typical day at work can either go quick and fast; or long and drawn out depending on how busy it is. With long and drawn out being the later. I've learned that wal-mart is built on the true value of quantity vs. quality, a place where abundance and satisfying the customer is its golden rule. My co-workers were wonderful, awesome, hard-working human beings; who endured the labors of working full/part time. Some days were good, some pretty bad. The hardest part of the job for me was the amount of management there was and no accountability; the most enjoyable part was the benefits and payday ."
good,exciting job from day to day
good,"Not that great, management is poor. no advancement but pay is decent and theres a bunch of hours"
good,It's an okay place to work .....not enough hours...and no room for advancement
good,"Although I enjoy working at Wal Mart, unfortunately it is not a position with in the company that I will be able to keep with current management. Unfortunatley the enviroment is not condusive to Single parents that are unable to have open availability ( which is 7am-11pm Sunday- Saturday)."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Wal-Mart until switching to overnight stocker, because I have a 4 year old and a 3 year old I was only able to get about 2-3 hours of sleep a night."
good,The job was okay it became available when it was most needed. There were times when I was told to do a job was not in my job description. I had to do it to keep my job.
good,able to grow with different opportunities
good,stock shelves with merchandise on the night shift. I was able to make decent money and had a generally steady work schedule that i could depend on. The hardest thing about the job was the drama that other employees brought to the workplace that made it difficult to do the job properly. Most everyone was nice and helpful and orientation was rather boring but very detailed so when i started i already had a good understanding of my duties and that was very helpful in being a strong team member even from day one.
good,"Walmart on winchester says that we are a family but no one acts like it. NO one is ever on the same page and no one can be trusted. Walmart really underpays every employees because you are never doing one job and they def don't appreciate their employees. I worked there part time for a year and three months and wasent eligible for the benefits the fulltime associates were given, even tho i was working fulltime hours."
good,worked well with coworkers
good,loved job but had to relocate back to my home town for kids at the time
good,"I was an orderfiller when I started, which was the hardest job I have ever had. We hhad headsets that told us which packages and the quanity to pull. We had to almost run on every trip for 8-12 hrs everyday."
good,"A typical day at Walmart was very hard unforgiving work. The problem was the management lacked needed knowledge of departments, and therefore, did not understand the need of help we required. I can say the associates I met there were phenomenal. We learned to make due, and work to are best ability, despite lack of help. So, overall, this job taught me, that I must stand strong even when the odds are clearly against me."
good,I enjoy working in customer service because there is hardly a dull moment. My interpersonal and communication skills have reached the level of expertise. I learned how to remain calm and professional through the worst case scenarios. I get along well with my co-workers; nevertheless management is nothing to write about (I have learned when there is nothing nice to say; say nothing). The hardest part of my job is dealing with the public all day because this can wear you down mentally and sometimes emotionally.
good,"I have worked at three different Walmarts in two states and I must say, some are better than others. It all depends on the managers. I have had managers that are willing to work with associates and negotiate a schedule that works with both parties. I have also have had managers that treat their associates as expendable tools. Altogether Walmart is a good choice for a ""job in between jobs"" but definitely not a career choice."
good,"liked working with people but didn't like being on my feet all day, which made my back hurt. Worked with a younger group at night and I enjoyed being around them."
good,Es buena pero pasas mas tiempo en ella que en tu casa no hay equilibrio laboral yy personal equipo entre companeros loque mas me gusto las novedades que se manejan
good,Fill shelves up with food load and unload deliveries. what i have learned was how to fill out an invoice. the management was very unorganized and wasn't around when you needed them. My coworkers were like family we had each other backs if someone needed help we would step up and give them a hand. The job was very simple great for a first time job. The part that i enjoyed most was talking to costumers. and doing my safety checks.
good,Not for someone who is looking for Full-Time employment...... poor hours and pay!!!
good,"I really enjoy working with customers, making them smile, and sharing in the things that make them happy. However my job becomes really complicated when I do not have the minimum resources to do my job, or my expectations are not made clear. I found this to be the case at my last job as a customer service manager. The staff and management were so friendly; and really made the job not so bad. As a result I was able to overlook the other short-comings of the company until other opportunities presented themselves."
good,"Walmart is a nice place to work; However, they do not have too much diversity in upper management. Also, when it comes to employee conflicts and going through the steps of the ""open door policy,"" it is almost like they do not make disciplinary actions."
good,Aprendir muito foi a porta para aprimorar meus conhecimento
good,I start out with unloading the trucks. Then we sort products that came off the truck. After that we move merchandise to the salesfloor and set up display items. My co-workers were friendly and hard working. The hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks. Most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
good,I mostly enjoyed being able to interact with people all day long. The fellow associates are amazing and extremely helpful!
good,"Bad hours and no advancement. Receiving and entering inventory. Learned how to work unsupervised and get the most done in least amount of time. Problem solving. A lot of Part time lazy co workers, which put an extra load on the rest of the Full time staff. Hardest part is missing time with my family due to my schedule. I love working and comradery of a number of my co workers and managers."
good,"I run the overnight crew. Set up task for employees. Train, teach and develop all employees. Coach, hire and terminate employees. I'm an assistant manager"
good,Worked long hour some you would come in at 7:30pm leave at 12pm the following morning when you have to be back at work that day at 7:30pm. Store manager constently changing direction you would have to redue it 3times due to they change there mind. You had to learn to laugh with the constent changes. Policy on schedues of managers and paper work that was srequired was only allowed the on your free time you could not be in an office writting reveiws or schedules unless it was you break or lunch or your day off. The good thing is that the coworkers and customers where nice and we laughed alot.
good,"Often scheduled me for times when I was in class, promised Sunday's off for church but did not happen, management was hard to reach and unapproachable."
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for however depending on what managers you have , some don't care about your job and the things you do. I have been with walmart for 2 years now and have been sent all around my store but have not been able to advance to a supervisor position because of my store management . Sadly I have realized at my store its not what you know, its who you know. But again Walmart is a good company to work for."
good,if hired as a stocker they will train you for every position under management and expect you to do everyone's job.
good,good experience working a good learning opportunity and explore the problem solving situations and handling difficult clients.
good,"When working for this company, I always felt as if I was never properly trained. I took things into my own hands to make sure I was a great employee and learned exactly what my department entitled. I stocked products, and answered phones. I didn't have any benefits with this company because I worked part time. I was also moved around to different departments on several occasions for lack of employees. Although, sometimes a work day was hard and stressful, I did enjoy working for this company."
good,Productive place to work very friendly associates. Lots of fun activities for fund raising events.
good,i hated working the shoe Dept when i come in for work there be fully staff then everone would leave shortly after i start leaving me alone in the shoe dept there needs to be at lease 3 ppl work it a shift i was younger and that was just wrong leaving me to work the shoe dept alone.
good,"This wasn't the best job in the world. There is no flexibility with your schedule. Management is inpersonal, they tell you that they don't care about why you need a day off, you just don't get it. I'd never work here again."
good,I worked 3rd shift 10pm to 7am.
good,A typical day on the overnight involves getting your assigned department and stocking and maintaing your area.
good,"Unfortunately the benefits and pay are not that great at Wal-Mart, but having benefits such as insurance and vacation time are better than nothing. The typical work day is usually very busy, at least in the pharmacy. I've learned a lot about pharmaceuticals, insurance policies, HIPPA, and how to deal with irate customers. The management leaves lots to be desired. Management at Wal-mart isn't very hands on, which gives the impression that they don't care leaving employees with the ""well then why should I care?"" attitude. The hardest part of the job is working in a small space with stressed out employees and customers. The best part of the job is helping patients in need and knowing that my job is benefiting many people."
good,"A empresa tem uma cultura fantástica, porém não colocada 100% em prática pelas lideranças."
good,Great customer service enviroment to work and interact with guests and co-workers.
good,Come in to work and be ready to work and try to perform at the best ability i could and try to do accomplish my daily goal
good,"Pull freight to sales floor, offload dairy delivery, stock freight, inventory management, pull freight to warehouse."
good,"Lots of customer service and stocking of shelves. i learned a lot about how a retail business is run. middle management was alway helpful, but the store manager was not. co-workers were cool for the most part. hardest part of the job was during store inventory. most enjoyable part was helping customers."
good,"love the people it always keep me busy, Helping in other department"
good,I love working with the public. I enjoyed that I got to meet new people everyday and I also have my regular customers that I know by name and their family life.
good,"Empresa grande, mas não fornece muitos beneficios aos funcionario."
good,The only positive to working for this company was the rate of pay and benefits. The apparel department was extremely under staffed. I developed a serious medical condition and was met with annoyance instead of compassion. This company treats their employees like they're a dime a dozen.
good,Limited growth and advancement opportunities. Challenging environment to work in.
good,"Very busy place to work,"
good,"Some managers are ok, there's no direction or room for advancement"
good,work is ok but there is little growth potential overmanagement and micromanagement issues
good,Very fast paced
good,a typical day at work is hard depen on the size of the truck. and most of the time i have no help and have extra tasks to do throught out the night most than other co-workers on my off days.
good,"A typical day at Walmart consisted of cashiering and zoning. I learned P.O.S, and good customer service skills. The management was fair and my co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was when it was slow, but I loved when it was busy."
good,"I was on time every day to work, and frequently stayed late as well. After the nightly meeting I would find out what department I had been shuffled off to that night, as I had been informed by other employees Walmart has a tendancy to ""through you into the deep end"" with little to no training in a given department. Such was the case when I was put in the electronics department alone without having even been trained to operate the register. I would work hard every night and complete me assignments ahead of schedule most of the time, but never felt like what I did mattered to anyone else in the store, certainly not management. That of course is when you can locate a member of management which was consistantly the most difficult task I would undertake during my tenure with Walmart."
good,"A full day at work I would work in many different places, from infants dept. To cashier, to jewelry, shoes, stock for the back room, also any other place mangement needed me."
good,"As many places it has its ups and downs, but overall a family oriented environment to work for."
good,it was a nice place to work but the stressful inviroment that they had with deadlines that were riduculous made the job stressful
good,"When I first started with Wal-Mart Sam Walton was still alive. Mr. Walton was very family oriented in both his stores and for his employees family lives. Since his death, the Corporate offices have taken away alot of bonuses that were made before, merit increases, the company is no longer family oriented, They have cut the number of Department Managers thus really hurting customer service and making the customer number one which is what we were taught."
good,"A typical day at work included pulling merchandise to the floor by use of pallet and pallet jack. We then stocked our area and some of us multiple areas. There were many coworkers who did not work at a fast pace but I normally came to help them. Our management wasn't very fair, but I just always tried to work at the best of my abilities. The most enjoyable part of the job was engaging in conversation with customers."
good,"I work as a cart-pusher at Walmart and have been for 4 years now. When I was first hired in the spring of 2008, I heard about the ""opportunities for advancement"" and sought to impress my bosses in the best way I could possible. Within a year, I finally realized that I was going nowhere fast. Despite all their ""promises,"" my managers sought to look the other way when I mentioned other possibilities of being transferred inside. When I persisted, the managers would ""coach"" me, which is a verbal write-up that prevents any way of being able to move to a different store or department for a whole year. This was their way of saying that I was a good worker, by planning to keep me in the parking lot where they thought I belonged with my ""potential."" I got to see associates who were there for barely a month while barely out of high school become my supervisors instead. Other coworkers who sympathized with me said that Walmart is a dead-end job and no place to advance. The only thing that kept me from quitting is because of the lack of jobs in the local areas and my need for a steady paycheck to keep paying the rent for my apartment."
good,I liked working there until one manager started to pick on me while there. I was sick a lot and he wrote me up for being sick and taking time off when i had Doctors notes showing i could not work for certian time periods. luckily that manager is no longer with the company any more.
good,Intergrated new reister functions
good,"Its a fun place to work kind of messy when it comes to coworker,management is ok some shows more attention to other, they really belive the customer is always right even when they are wrong.I enjoyed working at walmart"
good,"They are understaffed due to the unwanting of hiring more workers. A way to be cheap. I was a cashier but when they were short of cart pushers I was always asked to spend the entire day outside pushing carts with no instructor. I learned on my own and spent days at a time pushing carts. The coworkers are like family and that is one of the main great things of working there. I got let go because I was hired as a temporary, but nearly everyone I worked with wanted me back including multiple levels of management. I was one of the best cashiers and they hired a less skilled girl who could only work certain hours due to still being in high school. I feel the managers have no idea whats going on and they simply dont care. Its really sad and should be changed."
good,I work 14 to 16 hour days and required to work extra days and volunteer. There are some very good people that work there and try very hard to make the warehouse sucessful. The hardest part is I miss out on family time and the long hours. The most enjoyable is I have helped 2 people get promoted.
good,"Would be a very monotonous job, however the customers make it fun, new, and challenging. Multitasking, being personable, and impeccable memory is key for longevity and sanity working there. Most enjoyable part of the day is clocking out with an accurate register."
good,Provide great customer service to customer. They work you hard and dont give you any complients beside good job.
good,This was a part time job during college and only ran the cashier. It can be heavy at times. This required long standing term and it can bother my legs at times.
good,"Hard workers don't get rewarded, benifits are terrible, managers have a hard time communicating with each other so you are told to do things different ways by everyone and there are employees that don't do anything. Most employees are nice and although managment is hard to talk to the supervisors are all frendly and helpful."
good,"The typical day at Walmart changes pace day by day and doing the same thing, with the same problems will get you bored. There's not much a future learning curve or promotional aspect, just promises that you find that everyone gets. Management is never busy but says they are and when you need help will something only they can do, it takes them forever to finish their conversation about personal life. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the fact that no matter how hard you work, your never leaving your current position. Raises come to people that have content lives and don't want to get anywhere."
good,I learned a lot when I worked at Wal-Mart because this is where I first got into being a technician. My pharmacy manager at the time was fantastic when it came to making sure you got all the information you needed to do the job correctly.
good,It was an ok experience I would not mind working for walmart again. Only issue is that some of the managers would not listen.
good,"I feel like a third party contractor working for this company. There are very few things associates and management can do in the store. Nearly everything is handled at the cooperate level and that makes it difficult to tailor our store to better fit our customers. Very bonus driven culture, despite the costs."
good,"While trying to maximize profits, tools to complete tasks are scarce including manpower, technical tools and basic supplies."
good,A typical day will keep you working all day.
good,"Vigilancia electrinica de artuculos ,manejo del cctv,identificar a farderos y clientes deshonestos asi como preveedores"
good,I work at Walmart. It is a very socialble place to work. You have to be a well rounded person to work here. You also have to be able to work well around and with others. You may work with annoying co workers but for the most part its okay. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you are clocking out.
good,"I worked in a large department in Walmart. Most days I felt as though I was working the department alone. Hardly saw the other employees, they were always in other parts of the store, leaving me with the big tasks. I felt I wasn't getting paid for the work I was doing."
good,this place was a train wreck no leadership poor work enviroment nwas ran more like a sweatshop.
good,Although working at Walmart taught me a lot of trades. I feel like the job had to many managers and not enough employees to share a lot of the responsibilities.
good,Walmart has been fun to work for and very friendly co workers. The management team could use some work though. Very unorganized.
good,A typical day would be a anywhere from a 4-9 hour shift. I would spend the entire shift cashiering with an hour lunch and two 15 min breaks unless I worked a 4 or 5 hour shift in which I would get one break.
good,"A typical day at work was pretty bland..I was walking all the time, back and forth from the same spot, very repetitive. It honestly didn't teach me much, except it did help with my problem of interacting with people. My management was on a war-path when I was hired, they were basically hiring and firing people on a whim. My co-workers are probably the only people who helped me out, they also helped me work on my shy problem. The hardest part of the job was probably just how boring and monotonous it was. The most enjoyable was probably opening up and finally being able to talk to people better."
good,"relaxed qiet in the mornings. everyone is ready to work , set up programs and meetings and schedule tasks. anagement information given to co workers . I liked and enjoyed my co workers a fun group . e got along just fine . made me look forward to coming to work with them .w e worked well together. hardest part of the job was when we we had stock to place in position and assist thelarge rowd of customers , itwas at times over whelming. I met many poeple and made new friends in the customers I assisted.I really loved my job there."
good,"I would go in and have our afternoon meeting and do our stretches since we had to move the heavy items onto the floor and using our jacks and carts. Than we get assigned to which ever area needs to be worked on for that day. Our area consisted of stocking the shelves, binning the extra products until it needs stocked again, we would zone our area make sure everything is in its right home, and neat for our customers. on some days I would get called to help cashier when they were short. I also helped as a fitting room attendent and phone operator. I would also help with truck and unloading trucks. I enjoyed working here there was always something to do and you were always busy."
good,at walmart you come across people from different walks of life. My co-workers are like family. we help each other out when every any one has a question or needs help with anything. theres never a dull moment at walmart. i jus want a job were i can have a set schedule and still get the hours i need to provide for my children.
good,"There were a variety of tasks so it kept me busy and involved. I enjoyed working outdoors while moving plants with a forklift from inside the store to the outside. I liked the interaction with the customers when I would load the trunks of their vehicles with various plants and materials. The hardest part of my job was the cash register, which I was not familiar with. I worked with a good group of people and I stil see some of them when I go to the store and we keep up with what is going on with each other. I enjoyed being outdoors with all the fresh air and driving the forklift."
good,Most associates were easy to get along with. Enjoyed working in the Photo lab.
good,"A very fast paced environment where you can learn many skills. The best part of working at the pharmacy is the on hand skills and education that you get. However, once you have obtained those skills and knowledge Wal-mart does not reward their employees and try to keep them."
good,"While WalMart can be a wonderful place to work, the execution of its policies can sometimes be deemed as unfair. Seldom are second chances given when a mistake is made and rewards are few and far between. Overtime is strictly discouraged even when it is in the performance of your normal duties. When over the scheduled hours of work, you are ""encouraged"" to take extra lunch time to ""burn off"" the time."
good,"active with other associate and customers ,constantly learning and teaching others,not enought time everything completed i would like ,Working were there is a need ,when faced with adversity we quickly change our demands to adapt to situation,Prioritize and Delegate work assignment and give instructions on how to perform assigned tasks , review work to ensure `task are Completed, recognize others potential I want to be part of taking others higher level and making a difference in our department ,"
good,"I worked at walmart for 3 years unloading trucks, stacking pallets and doing inventory. The place is a decent environment with great co-workers."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. And, a loving envirnment and co-workers!"
good,"This place is going downhill. As the ""economy"" gets worse we have fewer associates that are asked to do more, while getting fewer hours. They keep trying to change a company that was doing just fine as it was. Customers are constantly unhappy with how customer service is going out the window, as there are barely any of us left to do so."
good,walmart mart is a good place for a person who does not mind fast pace environments.The management is sometimes hard to please but customers who appreciate good help make you for get the stress.
good,Working with people that cared about their performance was great.
good,"Each day at Wal-Mart was different. I met a variety of people, some I got a chance to know because they were regulars. I learned to get along with customers as well as my co-workers. It presented a family-like atmosphere. Co-workers bonded when someone within the company or neighborhood needed assistance. The hardest part of this job was trying to please difficult customers, which turned out to be the most enjoyable part. Management provided incentives and kept morale at its possible highest. Regardless of how you or others may feel on a particular day, I learned that if you smile, people will smile back at you."
good,A typical day at work was filled with helping customers and taking care of any questions or concerns that one might have had. The hardest part is that Wal-Mart is such a busy place they really needed to hire more people to fill in the time gaps they had in between shifts and there would be no one in some departments for hours at a time.
good,Learned a lot about the buisness
good,My typical work day preparing breads and donuts for morning sales. I helped in the deli when nees to assist customer. I love working for Walmart and I enjoyed all my co worker. The hardest part of my change was when I transfered to a different Walmart and the chemistry was totally different with the managers and the hourly employees.
good,"Walmart was my very first job. The managers were always postive. I would have liked to been given a chance to move up in the company. I work hard and have always been reliable and motivated, but never offered another job, which is why I am now looking for another compnay to work for."
good,Exciting and challenging everyday learning experience very family oriented and stressful environment
good,cashiering
good,"The Walmart warehouse environment places very high expecations on the workers who have no say so in the process. The management talks about a team environment but only individual scores are rewarded or affect performance tracking log. PTL is a list of all negative items that have occurred in the last six months which can lead to termination. There is no positive manner to affect the PTL. Constant threat of termination for poor performance is the only consistant message conveyed from management. Start up meeting, including exercises designed to cover liability from work related injury, and two breaks in a ten hour shift are held accountable in productive time and many mechanical failures are not credited as down time. This creates a very high stress environment where workers must move faster than is really safe inorder to maintain minimum production goals. This is a good place for to work for some one who is not self motivating or self directing. This is a follow orders as fast as you can kind of job."
good,"The people I worked with including supervisors were good friendly people, the managers were not so much. I was promised a pay raise after six months but when six months came around they stopped giving pay raises due to the ""economy"". Every day started with unloading and sorting a truck trailer packed with merchandise. Then we stocked the merchandise on the shelves. Then we unloaded more trucks as they arrived using pallet jacks and electric pallet jacks. Then we cleaned the stock warehouse. Operated and unloaded card board bail machine. All while maintaining a safe and secure environment."
good,It was a store with alot of promises but didnt follow thru. A typical day could be alot of different things. I learned alot and also taught alot since I had alot of good teachers in the past. Management team some of them were really great and others didnt follow thru on the promises they promied to do. Co-workers some were happy to come to work and others were just saying it was a job. It was a weird kind of attitude.
good,"Great job, but i was a bit dissatisfied with the organization of management. I hated working during the winter. The harsh weather combined with long ours made me dislike the job."
good,I was a cashier and really liked the public. The upper management has a lot to be desired. If you are not in the LOOP you are dust.
good,"A typical day at work for me: 1st when I get to work I see how many are in the fill que before we open, then I start fill those. I have learned over the years that I'm only one person and I can only do what I can in the amount of time that I'm there. For the most part so of my co-workers are lazy. I do enjoy working with them, but I expect everybody should do their part when they are there. The hardest part about my job is seeing people that truly can not afford there medicine. They have to pick and choose which medication they will get this month. The most enjoyable part about my job is knowing my customer. The relationship you develop with them is something special. Would not trade it!"
good,Helping the customer from beginning of the shift till the end of the shift. Changing jobs if you want every 6 months if you want. Don't like to hear about new ideas. Friends in and out of work. Thanksgiving till January is the hardest part of the job. Meeting new people everyday.
good,"Working at wal-mart was a decent job, Id say its a teenager job. We would get MyShare Bonuses every three months based on how our store did that quarter. I didnt think that there was any hard parts except re-doing mods every week. I didnt think that the managers were fair or knew how to run the company. I had some incedents there that I think were not handled properly. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co-workers, we worked together as a team great and all got along."
good,"I enjoyed what I did at walmart , but there are to many people in charge of the same things. They belittle you and make you feel like you are stupid.You have no say so or opinion. If someone tattles, or makes up something about you , they call you in office and believe the accuser and of course the accuser is in their too, then your suppose to go back to your dept. and act like nothing happen or you get called back in office and get wrote up for a bad attuitude. I was a dept manager and had no sayso in schduleing, or any thing else.Another thing, if they need you for another dept. that day , you stil lhave to make sure your stuff is done in your dept. even thhough you haven't been in your dept all day, or else your told your not managing your people well, however nobody else in your dept has any options to do the things a dept. manager does.It was the most stressful job I have ever had. My sales were always good butI guess that don;tmatter."
good,"The work was high-pressure, management always told people to work harder and faster, no matter how well employees performed. Staying after shifts ended was mandatory, but over-time was frowned upon. Management could not communicate between themselves very well."
good,A typical day @ walmart was of course busy. I learned a great deal of customer service. i enjoyed getting to know the employees and customers....
good,"Overall it was a nice experience, but if your young and trying to go to school or work two jobs this is not the job for you."
good,"I found a typical day was full of new working experiences, I have learned that Heath and Safety Board and being a team player within it has a lot of benefits in helping the other employees and the public in being safe. The hardest part of the job was learning the system that was implicated within the company."
good,"Unload the truck, put merchandise on pallets, pull pallets to the floor, price merchandise, stock shelves, dispose of trach in different bins from recyceling cardboard, plastic, and straight trash."
good,"Scanning and packaging customer's orders with cash handling is your typical day at work. Management wasn't bad at all. I don't think there was a hard part of the job, it's just learning to deal with the public eye. Probably the enjoyable part was the paycheck as a high school student earning his/her own money and making friends. It's your average high school/college part time job."
good,"Proper safety work tasks,management helpful.co-workers easy going worked as team to get proper job duties completing .Long work hours most enjoyable part being employed having a job, being needed to keep company going."
good,"CO workers are fun and talkable, mostly young. You do learn a lot of different things if you are in the sales floor. Learning the computer as a cashier is interesting. Talking to customers is fun too."
good,"To be honest, the typical day working at Walmart starts rather well, it's a fast paced environment and makes your shift go by. I learned a lot there, how to face an aisle, how to count drawers, and even a little of the customer service desk. Not once did I have an issue with a co-worker, we all stuck together and helped each other when the time arose. However, the management there absolutely sucks. Most of them are not that friendly, to the cashiers or to customers. They do not work well with other people or under stress."
good,my co-workers are wonderful people
good,"You learn something new every day. You are faced with multiple challenges on how to keep every customer happy, along with working well with your co-workers. It gets stressful, but you do what you can to keep a smile on your face and the customer satisfied. I enjoy knowing that I am providing help in a persons life when it comes to their medication. I am always dealing with insurances denying covering a customers medication and when I am able to work with the doctor or insurance company and get the medication covered or changed and satisfy the customer, it gives me joy when I am thanked. The hardest part of the job is making sure you finish every task you began. It is a fast paced job and you are constantly doing multiple things at once."
good,"My typical day included stocking, rotating old and new stock, and assisting customers. I learned how to read barcodes to put stock away. The management was unhelpful, and and bossy instead of helping in a leadership role. My co-workers were great people who were closeknit. The hardest part was trying to stock areas I wasn't familiar with. Most enjoyable part was working with the public."
good,"walmart is no longer about their employees being a part of the walton family, it is now all about the money signs, everything is money to the walmart i worked for in round lake, illinois. it seems that every regular associate that has not become a manager has been laid off wen they hit 5 to 6 years with the company."
good,I think it stands to make a large amount of improvements for employee and customers.
good,"Walmart is an okay job, but this store's organizational and managing skills are not very good. They can't keep people, they do not schedule enough people for the day, and they change your scheduled hours just days before without any warning."
good,"In a setting such as this, the employees taht surround you really make you work day go by in an enjoyable fashion. I did truly enjoy the work I did as a customer service manager. The only thing that I wasn't fond of was the inconsistant hours (ie 2pm-11pm followed by 6m-3pm)"
good,Manager lack people skills. And the managers do not stand by or back there associates. They pass the buck and half of them do not work at all. But if you like people it is a good place to work. Just don't expect any help or back up from the managers.
good,like the company just looking for more advancement.The people are nice
good,"A typical day at work would start by sliding your name tag to clock in for work, advance to your department of work and see if items in the back room need to be stocked onto the sales floor, if not then go re-stock customer returns, as-well as provide customer service through out the shift. Breaks and lunch are evry 2 hours of the 9 hour shift."
good,"Management at my store is kind of 50/50... We have some good and some bad, but you have that anywhere you go really. I'm a Customer Service Manager, and what makes my job so hard is the fact that I have to try to explain to customers why we don't have enough registers open when I actually have no part in scheduling. I don't know about other stores, but they recently even cut my staffing on the front end even though we already had more customers than we could serve in a timely manner. To me, Walmart is a company where management plays favorites... If they like you, then you will go far. If you are disliked, you will stay on the bottom until they find a way to run you off."
good,Never had any problems working there. Worked in the back mostly.
good,"As long as you do your job, you really had nothing to worry about."
good,"There is a lot of work to do and you aren't ever bored. Trouble is, the pay is not so good for someone who has been employed for many years and has established a good hourly pay in the past. This is a good job for someone who is just starting out and needing to get employment experience. The downside is you are on your feet pretty much all day. You definitely need a good pair of shoes!"
good,Work - Home life not balanced. Very stressful most of the time. But overall good place
good,It was a ok place to work if you need a job but i would not recommend walmart position to anyone. The managers show racism.
good,I really did like the job that I did at wal-mart in helping the associates . I am a people person
good,"I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart, I got along well with my co-workers, and was not afraid to work overtime or in other area where I was needed."
good,to many lazy people that worked there made it hard for the people that do their job and help around the whole store
good,You are able to advance pretty quick once you meet the requirements
good,"i loved the people i worked with but not the company, i dotn feel like they tried to help me move up higher in the company and they kept my hours below the ability to add any type of insurance."
good,Every waltmart location is differnt in their managment. The one I worked at did not follow the Walmart polocies and would terminate you sooner for inter office polotics than an actual infraction.
good,"compensation is fairly low, raises on a yearly basis with .40 being your highest raise possible and .20 the lowest, no unions, no real room for growth and development, long hours and no real time to enjoy anything but work. no job security at all and policies change daily to make life easier for the business and complicated for the employee."
good,Is a nice store have not expensive things but the managers are not good they make the job harder than what it is
good,Job was fine but the management was over poor and was a lot of favoritism in the store
good,Very Fast paced company i enjoy the rush when its busy enojy meeting different people and facing challenges.
good,The working place was not all that great. The co workers were rude some days.
good,Substandard health insurance
good,They are the basic retail that strictly wants to see you work and nothing else
good,Its a place to get you started on a career path. A stepping stone to something better.
good,"From what i`ve seen working at the walmart location that I do is walmart is a good company to work for, but the store I was generally hired on was a stop and go from the beginning. I was originally hired on for a certain position and then when I went in to do my interview I was then told by the Personnel Supervisor that I was to either be put into another position or I would not be able to work at WalMart Superstores. When originally I selected the position to better suit my Schedule due to parents medical problems. So, in turn I had to completely change my schedule for Walmart`s benefit. But, A job was a job, I took the position which I ended up enjoying in the end, but at the end I was transferred into a department I was completely unacknowledged on and was the only associate in that department for most of the day so it put me at a big disadvantage. Walmart may be a great company to work for, but from what I have seen so far, as an Employee i`m not satisfied."
good,enjoyed the experience worked at two different locations
good,"the company was very fast pased had no chain of command and couldn't see through requests asked from the higher ups, miss communications were frequent leaving the blame to fall on the lowest n the totem pole."
good,Walmart doesn't pay alot and want you to do everything. They expect you to never get sick. And they fired me because I missed work a couple of days because my wife was in a high risk pregency trying to miscarry my son. Sorry I felt that I need to be with my wife. But they knew what was going on said they would work with me and then turned around and fired me.
good,I enjoyed working working at walmart with the kind and friendly co-workers
good,good place to work if money is not a big factor. They starting pay is very low and seniority is a very important.
good,"I only worked there for a month. Definitely right for you if you NEED a job. I would never make a career out of it, but it's not a bad place to work, and who knows, it could be a great career path for you."
good,"Working for Wal-Mart taught me a lot of things. One thing of course is even if the customers wrong, they are always right. Wal-Mart helped me bring out the customers service skills I was nervous to bring out."
good,As far as the company aspect of the job goes Wal-Mart was a good company to work for. I enjoyed helping customers and at times helping other employees. I love when a customer came to me with a question and not only did they get an answer but the also left with an understanding of the product (at times of course).
good,"I like working with customers and helping them locate items in store.Didn't mind stocking shelves. I didn't like my manager. She wasn't willing to work with me as an employee. Overall it is an ok place to work, but I personal wouldn't like to go back."
good,When I first started working for this corporation it was a fun and exciting place to work. Things have changed to where everyone is micro managed to the point of not being able to complete the task. Employees are asked to compromise their integrity in order for the scorecard to reach maxium output with incorrect data.
good,"Most of the managers are great to work wit, there is sometimes room to advance, and if you do not have major life issues going on it is a good place to work."
good,"Wal-Mart itself was a very kosher company to work for, and the benefits for staying long term were nice, however if you needed to be transfered to a different shift, you were either told that they could not do that, or the current managment at the time was not willing to discuss it at all. They pay and benefits were exemplary, however the constant employee dissatisfaction from those that had been years was very openly discussed on breaks and it was not a happy place to be."
good,It was a job in retail field. I work as a cashier and as a greeter. It can be challenging at times.
good,"Go to work, leave work ,go back to work. No life outside of walmart, only 20 minute lunch and one 15. Work hard just to see managers and employees walk around."
good,"Minimum of management appreciation. No backup for position when on lunch break. Limited resources for the job you need to do, ie:  dead batteries,  no scanner available and no printer available."
good,Typical day sucks cause your short staff.  You do learn  alot. Management  is ok but doesnt listen. Workplace  culture  is good. Hardest part is they expect  you to do a lot. The most enjoyable  part is the works you work with
good,"The company pays better than most of its competitors.  There is no job security, as they say everyone is replaceable.  The environment is stressful and the daily expectation is never the same."
good,"Walmart constantly makes changes without telling there employees, the direction of the company is questionable at best. Can meet a lot of cool people working there."
good,You’ll most likely be laid off or fired for no reason if you were hired during any holiday season. Management doesn’t care about the individual worker
good,The drama with women at the job and not being able to have a ride to work. I wasn’t able to stay long because of school and because some days I was sick
good,"This particular Walmart I have worked for cane as a surprise for me the longer I have worked there. The managers picked on certain people and bullied them. They declined to give any employee time off for important reasons, one of which was for an employee who had to renew her visa. As much as there was a lot of drama it was still a good place to work at because the customers that come in make it enjoyable and remind me why I love to work retail."
good,A typical day consisted of showing up when scheduled and doing anything that was asked of me. This company always prioritizes shareholder value above all else.
good,Understaffed most of the time. Poor focus and poor working conditions for the pharmacist. Better training and more staff needed to accommodate the new clinical initiatives the company wants to pursue
good,Not a good place to work. Fast paced and their expectations for work is beyond unrealistic. Management is okay and they will treat you like a trash. No benefits for part-time employees whatsoever. They won't pay high wages unless you become a manager
good,I would work on the register all day. Clean when able to. Management were very nice. Coworkers made the environment tense. I loved working with customers on a daily basis.
good,"I worked overnight and I would say there are a few managers who are helpful and great at balancing the employees and the customers but some managers just care about profit and having people work. "
good,Management culture can make or break the job. Some locations were great to be at. Others the top management less though. During the last Distribution center that building went through 3 different general managers and 3 different assistant general managers in 4 years.
good,"You are always expected to do more than your share and if you cant, you'll be looked down upon. Also, get ready for everyone talking behind your back."
good,At my particular store the management got worse. Original store manager left and was replaced buy store manager who is rude and made-up rules on the spot that you should already know
good,Walmart is a very fast paced unforgiving place to work. High risk high reward. Great for lower to middle level management but adds in a huge layer of complexity for every additional million dollars in sales volume over 80 million.
good,in this company i felt like i was not belong. i guess i was just not in a right location of this company but i hear a lot of good things about this company specially for a retired person.
good,"Worked in the deli department. Not enough staffing for the work load that was put on the employees. Not really a family-oriented company, as they claim to be!"
good,Walmart management is not good at all...they pick their favorite associates...management does not introduce themselves to their employees. The personnel Dept does not help when needed
good,"A Typical Day At Work Can Sometimes Be Overwhelming And Very Frustrating. I’ve Learned To Be Patient And Understated Not Everything Will Go As Planned Also Not To Work For A Company That Doesn’t Care About You As A Person & Your Lifestyle. The Workplace Culture Is Somewhat Fair. The Hardest Part Of This Job Is Not Being Able To Fully Be Yourself And Working For Careless Company. The "
good,"Do to constant lack of employees you were always left to accomplish a 2-3 person job by yourself . "
good,"It's a great place to work if you are in perfect health, or with no one depending on you. They try to accommodate but fail do so for people with chronic diseases."
good,I liked my job very much it was mainly the people that worked there other associates that made the workplace tough. Walmart had alot to offer with benefits and room to advance but like I said before people there is what I had trouble with.
good,"Always on the move getting bounced around from task to task, and have to completely certain objectives in a timely manner. Managers are decent an somewhat respectful`` to the associates."
good,"I enjoy the people i work with not the company I work for."
good,Walmart has it's pros and cons. The biggest pro was I have mild disabilities and could take breaks when needed. Never had issues with other employees. Managers were pretty down to earth. The biggest con was the pay.  Not much pay only part time too.
good,"Seasonal work when it slow it’s awful 20-30 hours a week for a few months but when it’s peak season 60+ hrs , no long term associate benefits, all floor associates make same thing after 2 years employment. (15 + year and 2 year associates make same pay ) ."
good,"Good company but good ole boy system for promotions.  Great associates to work with, they work hard but, yet sometimes aren’t appreciated for what they do for company.  It’s unfortunate that they truly don’t care about you."
good,"typical day was just watching people and employees making sure people didn't get hurt from ladders , water and food spills, and watching for stealing. I learned a lot about cameras,computers and piecing together clips of people that where stealing for the police dept. and what to watch for. management was ok. work place culture was pretty good the employees that have been there for a while took pride in their work. To me the hardest part of the job was watching out for knives and other objects a person could use against you. The best part of the job was helping people."
good,Working for Wal-Mart was not very difficult at all. The work environment was very laid back. Processing invoices to assure that Wal-Mart stores across the US did not have any Shrink within inventory.
good,"Walmart was my first retail job, The experience taught me a lot but overall was cut short due to scheduling issues with collage. Management was okay but their expectation of a single employee to rearrange and stock 10 Isles every single night was bit repetitive."
good,Communication is poor management make people work more fright with less help and expecting to have it done in less time then gets made when we don't get do when they schedule people to come in later and to get of early leaving us with 8 people to stalk 90 hours of fright in less then 8 hours not fun and don't expect to have a home life unless your a supervisor or management needs better pay for cap teams because door greaters get paid more for just standing and checking r receipts
good,After working on the floor for a number of years I decided to join the maintenance department.  The refrigeration and training I received from outside of the company was excellent and advanced my knowledge greatly.
good,"Working at Walmart can be a mixed bag. On one hand, the job itself isn't too difficult, as long as you don't mind standing and walking for long periods of time. Breaks are pretty plentiful (2x 15 min. and 1x 1 hour). Pay however is not so great. They typically start you at about 9.50 until you pass a ""certification like"" course and then increase pay to 10/hour. Seems good at first but unfortunately, you're only getting about 30 hours a week on avg. because you usually start off with a 4 days on 3 days off schedule. Depending on where you are that can be fine unless you're trying to make more money. Reason being, Overtime can be super hard to come by (especially at Walmart in my expirience) Just a matter of what you want."
good,Walmart as a whole is a good company. It’s the management you need to watch out for. They say they have your back but will be the first to throw you under the bus. They don’t know how to talk to people. They want you to do everything in the store but don’t wanna pay more for the work.
good,I have mixed emotions about Walmart. I loved Walmart when I first started. After many years I wasn’t happen the company was starting to evolve. The way they started to treat employees. A lot has changed over the years.
good,They have the dumbest dress code I’ve ever seen. Managers expect you to be next to perfect. Late breaks all the time. Being put in random situations that you shouldn’t even be near cause I’m a cashier. Constant bs from customers
good,Its an overall good place to work if your looking for flexible hours this is a great place to work. They have a family friendly environment so the whole family can feel at ease.
good,Company can be cold and often not understanding of hourly associate needs .  The Field HR team is mostly ineffective as a result of poor guidance and decision making from above
good,"The job was fine. Management isn’t too helpful. But overall it’s a good place to work that has many benefits. But they do have a point system, so if you have an attendance problem I wouldn’t recommend working here."
good,Ok job to have not too bad just work a lot and not really noticed for how hard you work or good work ethic looking for something different with higher pay
good,there is nothing I have to say at this time however if I do stumble across some ideas I will relay the message at my work place or through the surveys that is being conducted
good,"Working at walmart just gives you the feeling they don't care whether you live or die, as long as you make it to work. Management seems to be very indecisive and disengaged. Stay away!"
good,Busy around  the first and the end of the months and holidays. helping the customs were my favorite times. I learn to work with differ t ethicmof people
good,"Most nightcrews live or die by the Guidance of thier direct management. I was lucky, my direct supervisor and the assistant manager assigned to night crew helped get things done. "
good,At Walmart I was asked too  work in my department  98% of the time which I enjoyed. There was many extremely busy days but that's too be expected at such a big company. There were a few instances  where I thought management had ulterior motives but that could never be confirmed.
good,If you are a customer experience associate then the job is pretty easy but when it’s busy in store your life becomes a very stressful. The management is pretty good and usually accommodate to your needs or at least they try to. Your job could be backbreaking or the most simple thing in the world but the one thing that you will have in common with all your coworkers is that no one genuinely enjoys the job.
good,Wasn’t really dependable they don’t solve issues they are careless in certain situations . But overall it was great other then that I loved the people I worked with it was fun at times and also frustrating at times
good,"I worked at Walmart for a little over a year while working a full time job because I was struggling to make ends meet. My main job title was Cashier, and during that time, there were three months where I was not scheduled AT ALL. I ended up picking up self-checkout as a secondary and once I did I was mainly scheduled at self-checkout, but I still was not getting enough hours. Then I ended up quitting my full time job and expanded my availability to all day, and that still didn't help me. Yet for whatever reason, they continued to hire more people instead of giving me hours. Word of advice, DO NOT rely on Walmart for a steady income."
good,Show up happy and on schedule. Be willing to serve and ask questions. Mind your business and do not abuse your protected time off. Follow these steps and guaranteed to keep a job at Walmart or most places.
good,bad place to work if ;you want to work if you want to stand around and talk that is your job seemed let the kids run the small groups to different jobs they just sand around while older and people who care about there work do all  the work.  let manager know they put you on a project by your self with all the hard labor.  was not good experience.  they offer knee pads after you get water on the knee
good,We stayed super busy all the time. I feel like certain people advanced quicker than others. We had great CSM’s they really wanted to help us. It’s very hard to get days and I had a young son in school.
good,"Before working at Walmart, I was told not too because they  don't care about their employees but I thought maybe it was just at that location so I applied anyway. Soon after being hired back in 2015, I found that statement to be true and to be true at other Walmarts and different locations and states. It's seems like all they care about is if you're showing up to work and if their shifts are covered."
good,"Politics and Drama."
good,As an asset protection associate it is not the job you are initially told about. They just have you check receipts of almost everyone rather than actually looking out for thefts and this increases stress with customers resulting in being cursed out or people being unpleasant to you on an hourly basis. Other employees are sometimes unpleasant thinking your job is so easy but aren't paid more than them and you really want to be in almost any other position. They will tell you to do tasks that provided by management in a booklet you are told not to do. The job is pretty useless in stopping much considering if someone runs or just says no you let them pass and constant lifters know this. You basically let customers rat themselves out or irritate the good ones.
good,The pay is really poor for the expectations that they have for their workers. We are always being told that we aren’t doing good enough and that we need to improve.
good,"Many of the personnel in authority over other associates are hypocritical on tasks to be completed, deliberately cause issues with associates demonstrating their authoritative power, in some cases to override a customer’s or an associate’s complaint. ALL individual associates have NO confidentiality rights for they are broken from the top and down the “chain of command”. "
good,It was a great opportunity loved working there. There always new things to learn loved helping the customers. It's a great company great team members the managers were very understanding. Training was easy and anytime I had a problem at work someone was always there to help.
good,"I loved my job. I left due to POOR management. There was no structure, communication and a lot of gossip (he say, she say). Management was lazy and didn't care about their employees. They were more worried about being in people's business instead of worrying about their JOB. I was taken advantage of and didn't feel appreciated at all!"
good,"First of all I ran three departments (Sporting Good, Hardware & Paints) I always arrived early so I could check store sales, check inventory for high traffic, good selling, as well as slow selling items, check calendar and website for upcoming events that will effect my departments and make adjustments, enforce my areas. Replaced"
good,"Had a very good time working at Wal-Mart, especially with the set schedule, routine and above average pay that they offer as compared to other employers in my area. Good Coworkers and environment"
good,Began as a great company after opening a brand new store. After a while  managers did not care about customers any longer. This company only cares about making money. No support for employees attemt to improve customer satisfaction.
good,I was fired due to missing work for health and my son. Manager lied to fellow coworkers telling all I quit due to health issues. Complete lie!! If you’re not one of the favorites you don’t get the schedule that fits your needs! I did learn a lot about my job and now I will take my knowledge and prosper elsewhere.
good,"Having been there three years, the job is easy but lacks motivation to thrive. Would recommend spending time outside of work to not be drained. However would recommend for students."
good,"the work place itself was a great place to work but management was not that good. They had great benefit when it came to medical, dental and vision but vacation and any time off went down hill"
good,"I think that its not fair that walmart does not except doctors notes, because I was injured and i had a doctors note but they didnt except it. Thats not right at all"
good,"Management does not seem to care too much about what issues are occurring in every day work, they tend to only care about the results.  Many employees do not feel valued.  Works with my schedule though and worked well for me while pregnant and able to get to docotrs appointments"
good,"""i am a hardworker and give my full 100% on the job. no matter if it’s difficult or easy, i always manage to get the job done. i know customer service is top priority.”"
good,"I have worked for several different Walmarts & its all the same. You have to work their hours, you WILL work all holidays, you cannot take PTO during the holiday season. The managers really dont respect their employees and they will NOT work with you if you have school or another job or even kids! This would be my last option! The manager at this store is rude $ disrespectful!"
good,"Walmart is a decent job for a higher than fast food salary and more work variety. I worked at Walmart for a few months and when I got sick, they fired me."
good,Management is poor . They can replace you with an heart beat your just another person to them. Also if you want benefits they are taking a arm an leg out your check
good,walmart is not bad to work for its the people that comes in and the mangement. they also need to clean the store more and learn how to communciate with their associates.
good,"Unless you want to move up to salaried management and live, breathe and bleed retail, it's only a good placeholder job. I moved up to hourly supervisor my initial stint there and it was ok, I just felt like the stress vs. pay ratio was skewed."
good,Wasn't the worst job I had but not the best. Always had to do overtime and never got off on time. Ended up doing other people's work because they were short staffed or lazy.
good,"I learned a lot, management could work on how they speak to their employees and how they treat them. also they should learn to help their associates in certain ways."
good,"good place to work, decorate pre baked cakes, cupcakes and make customer orders. hardest part is keeping up with customer orders on the weekends with customers calling for last minute orders"
good,it was a great job until management switched and everything started to look bad. i always make sure that i finish my tasks but the managers never finish theirs. a-lot of employees are quitting which is making it harder on the workers who are still trying to work there. the managers are getting in trouble with their manager so now they want to treat the workers bad and give blatant disrespect. they keep talking about a pay raise but they never actually implement it. As a Cap Team 2 Associate we do the most woke but get paid the least. Our managers wont give us overtime and i would really like to take my talents else where.
good,When working some people have chances for advances but you have to be a managers favorite in order to get the chance. This is the way it seemed to me in my experience of 6 years with the company
good,"Decent job and you make a little more than what minimum wage is so that's a plus. People are generally friendly to work with, and usually have a good opportunity to move up positions"
good,I enjoy working at Walmart servings customer I just need more money for all I do at work overtime to coming in early  to working in other departments to help stock and fill the floor
good,Walmart is a good first job to have teaches social and work skills ... it’s more of a short term job then long term .. Walmart ask for so much but give so little in return
good,Job satisfaction is up to each location. Ice worked at 3 different walmarts and each were different experiences. The smallest one i worked at was the best experience. People over all were good. Customers were mostly nice and co workers were decent to you. Advancement is there and now days the pay is good. When i worked there play wad not good at all.
good,"The hours are never the same, they never make it easy to get days off. They close down early most nights so 40 hours isn’t an option anymore, along with the fact that all overtime is now cut for good. I can say that I have learned quite a lot from this place and I’m ready to move forward into a more professional environment."
good,"Being a part time employee at Walmart, there is no assurance for hours of my work. It depends on Wal-mart’s business needs. Too much pressure to promote Master cards. Management seldom care about their associates needs."
good,"I`ve been working at Wal-mart for almost 2 years now. I`m now department manager for 3 departments. I can say, the Pay is definitely below my expectation. The team is great and works efficiently together."
good,Doesn't offer a lot of pay and a lot of hours and a lot of benefits but you just go to work and do your job show up on time and you really have no problems
good,The Walmart in worked at wasn’t the best place for a young man to work  once the mangers and other coworkers found out my age they began to act differently to me  the boss was never around to help and management showed little to no concern about their employees
good,"Great company to work for if your single. The upper management was great they did a great job but they had their down falls, in their favoritism. But automotive was great."
good,The work was good and the pay was good the Management needed work no room to move up. I was 5 minutes late when was not giving a Grace. Who was fired on the spot after I had given half of my day.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart for the four years I worked there. I switched between full and part time, as needed with my schooling. They were very supportive of my education and super flexible with hours. I liked the people and environment when I worked there. I left just as management underwent a huge overhaul. No idea what it's like to work there now. I worked from 5am to 2pm. Waking up was difficult but leaving at 2 with the whole day ahead of me was awesome. Plus, I got to avoid the stereotypical Walmart shoppers that come out at night."
good,"This is a strong company because of their beliefs and values. However, depending on where you work, and with what management you work for, it could be challenging at times. Work/life balance was the least promising thing at this job."
good,Walmart has a very high turn over rate. But in all it was a very pleasant place to work. I had a good strong team of employees that accomplished task that should of had a crew double the size we had. Great team building skills!
good,"A company relentlessly focused on cost cutting have produced management having little power and even less discretion. They can only follow orders from the head office and try to meet ever demanding goals with ever fewer staff. Management or employee development for the record, are paid lip service with the time invested in management training less than half of what it used to be. And as for the associates, only department managers get any training. "
good,Walmart is a great place to work I have been there 16 going on 17 years retail is and can be difficult at times past 6 years I have been on hr dealing with more that 350 associates
good,"If you like to make a difference with people, this is a good place to work. I loved to be able to help my reg customers. Always there to deliver great customer  service."
good,"I loved my job at Walmart. I could have done without the put downs, calling You out in Public in Front of Customers. The Bad attitude they projected. In General, We were all under the impression that if they were not Ugly to the Associates....they were not doing their jobs. The RETALIATION.....that was Unbelievable....did Bentonvile care...No....they would just call the store & get the Manager on the phone & he would simply say it was either not true...or it had been blown out of proportion.So do Your self a favor...don't apply at 0537...that will be You're Future....Thanks!!!"
good,"It's like any other job , it has its ups & downs; while there are some management members who want you to succeed and willing to show you new ideas to help move up in the company. The benefits are good , its just a shame you have wait so long to just have access to them."
good,"I enjoy working customer service, working with different personalities  and experiencing all the different customers.  I enjoy the opportunities just not happy with the lack of support from the management team."
good,"few years ago Walmart was great place to work for. as time went on, treatment of employees went down and expectations were impossible to meet. Might as well been a sweat shop with the treatment.."
good,management that we have now don’t help do t know how to talk to people makes the job so stressful and threatens to coach you for any little thing and says it all over the walkie it’s embarrassing
good,Greatful to have a job and grateful for my loyal customers  I just don’t understand why they act the way they do cutting jobs by adding the the self checkouts
good,"Works only for someone who is not looking to advance to a higher level without living as the job. Provides steady but low income, benefits are good but better as job than career."
good,I have mixed feelings about my experience as a Walmart employee. On one hand I liked the management (though on some occasions some of them were unprofessional) and I felt the pay was decent. On the other hand I felt that Walmart did not appreciate the work I did and I felt they allowed others to do very little while I picked up their slack. They were also not willingly flexible with my schedule.
good,"Working there every day with the people i work with are very nice. It is more so the job, I don't feel that I am being fairly paid for all the work I do at the job."
good,"Working for Walmart leads to long hours and struggle with work/life balance. Although Walmart does take care of their associates, it is still a highly stressful position when in management."
good,The pay is good and is great for a people person. I often had to choose between family and work not flexible with a single parent schedule. The hours aren't usually there unless you're management
good,Walmart is a good experience for working in retail. The number one problem that I had with walmart is that it felt like corporate cared more about the money than their employees
good,"When I started working there I was given very little training and just had to figure it out. The managers were awful, there was absolutely no communication between them."
good,"Overall it's an okay place to work, they tend to cut hours after the first of the year, management expect results without reasonable solutions.  They used to offer a lot more benefits and they have really went downhill on that in the last 10 years."
good,Diverse retail environment on many levels.deffintly able to expand your skills when desired.oppurtunity to further acquire knowledge involving many retail positions
good,"The main thing to look out for is incompetent management. Everytime I asked for help they had me go ask someone else,  or try to have me fix a problem i didn't know i had"
good,Cashiering / customer service / stocking /deli department - not much to say management was not all on one page. Hours cut due to the installation of the self checkouts and not able to sustain the quality of living on the pay provided
good,"Great company to work for, in my opinion, more professional unbiased managers are needed. I worked extra hard everyday, went in on my days off, and did more then what was asked of me. Hoping to have been there longer just to get treated as if I wasn’t a human being."
good,Walmart seemed like a good company at first however they are not flexible with hours they help you out a little bit but the only time you asked for help from them in regards to certain things I felt that they were not always there
good,"Easy job, lots of room for advancement, just not a lot of happy people that worked there, many of the other associates were quite rood. Probably the easiest job work wise I've ever had tho."
good,I'd say the only good experience I've had with the company is meeting my amazing coworkers. Overall I learned a lot of different trades and gained a lot of knowledge and experience working there.
good,Can be stressful when customers are impatient and don't agree with policy and rules of the job. You work rain or shine or snow or windy no matter what.
good,I did enjoy working for this company. I’ve had other jobs that worked inside of this company and this company treated me better than my employer did. It worked around my school and gave me a fair amount of hours and time off.
good,Being an assistant store manager has more cons then pros. You are expected to be there 24/7 to ensure your business is in order. You often left to figure out what needs to be done with little to no guidance.
good,"Wal-Mart has a complex and exhaustive IT landscape to manage its 2.3 million associates. People Systems is a suite of applications used to maintain, organize, support these millions of employee data records and synchronize their activities across multiple interactive IT systems, typically from Hiring to Termination. People Systems landscape is complex with HRMS packages, customized home-grown applications and third party applications."
good,"Learning as much as I can, to get the experience and use that, for another career. Always be opened minded, & have a plan everyday to be able to succeeded and move on to the next day."
good,"its not as bad as everyone thinks. decent pay. just show up, do your job and get out. people waste too much energy on things thats not work. with all the new changes coming and 10 years, i am ready to leave."
good,"Each Walmart has its own culture and feel  management differs greatly and the financial divide in this country is most prevalent when your Walmart is in financially difficult area  I enjoy my work, however management is never encouraging if your work"
good,"Great for high schoolers to gain some job experience and get better at people skills. Dealing with billions of customers does wonders for ur abilities in dealing with all types of ppl in all types of situations. Dont stay too  long tho, and if ur in college, rmr that education takes priority."
good,It’s really not a bad place to work if you can deal with the different personalities & attitudes from the customers. A good thing about working there is they will work with you if your going back to school or something.
good,"Decent company to work for. Career advancement is all up to the individual and your ability to network. Have had a series of bosses, have yet to experience a true leader."
good,"Very upset at not getting shifts for 2 straight weeks!"
good,"Walmart is definitely hard you could work harder than everyone do your job better than everyone and still won’t be enough for the management, I stayed a cap 2 associate for 2 years and watched people that came after me get management positions, I’ve done task no manager has done I teach managers how to do certain task, it’s an okay experience but I want something better for myself I want to move up and not stay still."
good,"Great work place as co-workers go, but the demand doesn't fit the pay. Have to either get a part time job added to my source of income or find a better paying job."
good,Walmart is an okay environment to work in. The management team definitely needs more training. Needs more experienced management as well. Better dress code is needed
good,It’s a seasonal job nothing major you scan items and place them in the correct cubbies or pack them up to get shipped off to customers they do have their favorites and when it’s slow they VTO a lot of people
good,Often times set schedule was not followed. Understaffed. Often there was only 1 person per department even on busiest days. In order to be promoted to full time you had to work 40 hours for 12 weeks. They would work you 40 for 11 and drop you down to 32 for a week regularly.
good,Friendships are created very easily with staff. the hardest part of the job is dealing with some people with attitude. Some management was very helpful. There could have been improvement as to how the cashier/front end work was given. Lack of communication is prominent in this job.
good,"Many different kinds of people work at Walmart.  Many take great pride in their job, unfortunately many quality employees keep working for a low paying wage.  People who perform at a high level should get paid more.  If you don’t get a starting wage you want don’t expect to work your way up quickly."
good,"It was ok for a college student, someone responsible for only themselves, or someone who is partially retired. I was neither, which is why I had to move on."
good,Most days are about the same in job description. On occasion I was responsible for other tasks. Most difficult part of the job is the indifference of management to attend to their tasks promptly.
good,"Wal-Mart is such a large company that advancement feels nearly impossible. The management is terrible and a hassle to deal with. Requesting a day off or a change in schedule is rare. And in my experience, your job title means almost nothing. I would come to work most days and be pulled to another department before I made it halfway through my shift."
good,Get ready to work for this company. It is a very high pressure work environment. They require a lot from you. You'll also be working holidays and weekends.
good,A good place to for the pay but the hours aren't good and there is no life outside of work. Management has poor people skills and lacks training their employees properly.
good,"Always keeps you active and moving around. If you like working out this is definitely a job for you, it will keep you moving around and bending down a lot picking up heavy stuff and light stuff."
good,There is happiness and satisfaction at walmart if you dont include the higher-up staff. The management treat workers as theyre dispensable and do not accommodate for life events or needs of workers. I was also given a very hard time when injured at fault of walmart even though I had not shown any problem with them. There is little opportunirt to ever accelerate your career.
good,"No Accountability by employees for not completing their jobs."
good,"When I started in 2008 it was a great place to work and management and store were both in good shape  when I left in 2019 the management was not approachable, issues continued and employees were very unhappy overall.  Also the lack of respect to employees had  diminished immensely"
good,"high stress customer service."
good,I was hired at a time when managers and supervisors were being moved around so the job wasn’t hard it just was hard to stay up late and the managers seemed out to get me
good,"This Walmart is chaotic most days and stressful. However, if you change your mindset, it can be a better working environment. You will not have easy customers, management isn't a strong suit, building connections and friendships goes a long way, and you can make friendships that will last you a long time which is always a plus."
good,"Me destacaba en dar el mejor servicio al cliente, siempre con una sonrisa y los Buenos Días, Mantenia mi área siempre organizada"
good,"As time went on, Walmart's attitude, pay, rules began to change. It was no longer about Associates but PROFITS. Wally is probably rolling over in his grave."
good,When I started I was hired as a cashier and I was promoted after 5 months to Customer Service Manager. I really enjoy my job. But I'm looking for something full time.
good,It was a good job experience to have in customer service. I enjoyed helping customers find what they needed and the atmosphere was laid back. Management needed work though.
good,"Somewhat fair , little time spent with family, management wasn’t always the best, plenty overtime when needed , worked four days a week sometimes 5 overtime was decent ."
good,You get worked for every cent you get paid for sure. Management always trying to put their failures onto their coworkers so they dont take the blame. Higher ups dont care unless 10+ year employee.
good,"Empresa ótima, com possibilidade de desenvolvimento na comunicação, relacionamento interpessoal e em outras atividades. Proporcionava direcionamento de carreira conforme formação."
good,"If you like interacting with people and helping people, then Walmart is great. If you have the right management, they will give you the opportunity to advance. Some managers will not allow you to advance even if you are qualified. I learned that management can use some courses on how to treat their employees. Walmart's 10 foot smile rule should be followed by managers as well. A pleasant manager makes the day go by more quickly and makes you proud to work at Walmart. But this is true in all jobs."
good,"It is indeed fun working with Walmart, i learnt and am still learning a lot working there. The managers i worked/working with are good and experience."
good,"They worked with the flexibility of the schedule when they wanted to. I didn't have enough employees in the area sometimes, leaving me to rip and run back and forth."
good,When I was at Walmart I often felt overwhelmed because we were short staffed quite often and in the three years I worked there we had three different supervisors.  It got crazy at times but there are some awesome people that I worked with and who did go the extra mile for the customers.
good,Its about what you would expect working at Walmart. They will work with you to get hours but the day can really drag if you are not crazy about the job.
good,"Basically theres a lot of cattiness and gossip that goes on at Walmart...🤷‍♂️ You can complain to management about it but I've found that a lot of ""brown nosing"" goes on by the employees to secure their jobs, instead of going by work performance...😔"
good,"I had been working for Walmart for 10 months, and when I got coached I asked that my supervisors investigate. They told me that they would only investigate the case if I went to the supervisor after I had been fired. in other words I could potentially retain my job if I came in on my day off and requested that my reason for firing would be investigated and they would maybe investigate it."
good,A typical day in Walmart is rewarding but stressful . The most enjoyable part of the job was my patient's . I had the best patient's and always kind. I was thankful we had a 30 minute lunch .
good,friendly and courteous .. always speaking to the customers in a friendly manner.. sometimes a smile goes a long way.( I quite enjoy interacting with my customers and having a repore with them.)
good,You clocked in and it was busy from that moment on you are always helping out anyone can you checking out your customers and running little errands to help other sections of the store. It’s like a little family.
good,"I would show up and punch in to start my shift. I did various jobs in my 25 yrs. I learned how to run a cash register, transfer money, pay utility bills. I learned how to unload a truck and stock merchandise. I had many manager over my 25 yrs. Some good, some bad."
good,"It’s a good work place, the co workers are all nice and friendly, management needs to work on their managing skills, the pay is decent enough, I’d personally recommend this as a first job."
good,I learned a lot about retail from the worlds largest retailer. My area of responsibility was mostly in frozen foods. Our store experienced a high degree of turnover while I was there. That makes it very difficult to build a team atmosphere.
good,"My time at walmart taught me good customer service skills, efficient ways of organizing visual displays, and how to manage a good work and life balance."
good,Everyday brought something new.  Associate problems was challenging everyday.In recent years they are leaning toward more automation than employee jobs.
good,"I did advance pretty quickly but this store has a high turnover for department managers. There was no structure in my training, they literally put me with another manager and just learned as I went. My assistant manager provides no communication or support so I'm left with figuring things out on my own. Pretty much my goal each day is just to make it through the day to the weekend...."
good,"Stocking, backroom, & receiving associates work to ensure customers can find all of the items they have on their shopping list. Depending on the shift you work, your job could include moving inventory in the backroom, unloading trucks, or helping customers while stocking shelves. From hot trucks in the summer to filling ice cream in the freezer, this fast paced job can be physically demanding -- it's like being paid to go the gym"
good,Dont expect much from this job as their turn over rate is thur the roof. They know your replaceable and you will know you are once you see employees come and go more then you change your clothes.
good,"It was a great place to work because co workers would help each  other but management was really unorganized and unprepared for our shift, pay was ok but they like to also over work their staff"
good,the reason i got fired was that it was after 1 pm i havent had lunch yet i wasthere since 8 in the morning and they told me we got someone to replace you clear the lot and so i started to go as fast as possible and then i was getting yelled at causei was going to fast andi got fired.
good,"Ce qui est positif: Ce travail est bien pour l'école. "
good,"Working as a cashier at Walmart holds carries much of the same expectations as any other cashier job. Some customers are rude, others friendly. You're expected to help organize and clean up when there's no customers to help. But there's always an incessant expectation to sell customers on applying for the company's credit card, and getting as many people through the line as fast as possible. Management stresses this to every single cashier, and insists that we make certain numbers on a daily basis despite that being out of our control, when customers don't want to sign up for a credit card. It never feels like your words have any kind of say in the company, and your actions are constantly being scrutinized; One wrong move, and any hopes of climbing the corporate ladder just fall apart."
good,"My assistant manager was hardly present at work. I was used to pick up her slack with the other department managers without proper training. I was told to come in early and stay late everyday which isn't an issue. The issue was is that my hard work was not recognized by the personnel above the department managers. Which were the employees that hired, fired, and promoted. I was promised on multiple occasions that I would be looking at a management position in my current department and other departments after 2 months of working there and after almost a year I gave up on waiting."
good,"Really excited when I first started, but was continually screwed out of the benefits (shorted me the hours right before qualifying for them). Management was a mixed bag, some were great and others were meh. Coworkers were amazing minus a couple of lifer grouches but even they had their good days too. Salary was awful for the stress they put us CSMs through, definitely deserved at least $16.00 per hour for the stuff that happened there. But it is a great way to get manager/supervisor experience."
good,They do not seem luke they want you to move up. They do not seem to think that moving departments should be done unless they dont like where you are. They exspect you to work out side of your pay grade.
good,Walmart Canada is a one of the world's largest employers.  It's an excellent place to learn and see how fortune 500 companies function the way they do.
good,"Working at walmart was a great experience of my life. It showed me I have the capabilities to be greater and work even harder. However, I am looking to expand my skill set and become a higher quality employ."
good,I like the job and the work I was doing was not bad and the overnight team was really a team. But the managers were terrible they didn’t care about us and they a times forget to give breaks and for that type of work a break is needed
good,Loved working in and around my department helping customers and freight. Down side was management didn't now if they were coming or going. It left to confusing direction which lead to two different management asking you to do different task not knowing that the other manager gave you direction to do another task. Wal-Mart would be a good place to work if Management wasn't in such chaos.
good,Great place to get experience and start towards a career. Easy to learn and grasp different jobs. A nice stepping stone to get to what you really want in life.
good,"Walmart used to pride themselves on taking care of the customer and treating associates like family. It's no longer that company. Positions are being eliminated every few months. Hours get cut quarterly. Upward movement depends on favoritism. Associates can no longer support their family on a Walmart income, yet Walmart demands open availability, thus making the need to work two or more jobs difficult."
good,"As an ASM at Walmart, you'll be expected to be somewhat robotic. You will more than likely work more than the minimum of 50 hours that you are scheduled, and therefore the salary becomes less attractive at this point. You will learn many skills that can be applied to any retail setting, and deal with a vastly diverse customer base. Upper management will continuously pressure you to hit metrics, with a workforce that needs constant monitoring and follow-up."
good,"Walmart as a company has pretty decent morals, however, every Walmart has a different feel to it, unfortunately management really does influence whether or not you will enjoy your time with the company or dread it. Pay is okay, they will refuse to work around your schedule unless management takes a special liking to you."
good,It was good I really liked working there it was the longest I’ve ever stayed at a job I really enjoyed the people that worked there it’s a nice company
good,job is fast paced you dont get breaks on time you . good work environment . alot of miss communication with supervisors. not a great job for a single parent that doesnt have alot of people to walk child while at work  .
good,Aun que no esta permitido te hacen que cheques tu horario para no generar tiempo extra y te regresas a trabajar. Te mueven los horarios de un momento a otro al igual que los descansos.
good,Walmart has drifted away From the core values it started on. Everything is about over worked associates and less pay. They don't care about family or other issues just about what they need not the needs of otheres
good,"Customer needs were meet. Better communication. Management was offer to different Culture. Hardest would have been not making Wal-Mart motto's as a whole. I enjoyed meeting different customer young and elderly. I love customer services, treating others like I wanted to be treated."
good,"aprendi o sistema da empresa."
good,"I stalked shelves and cleaned aisles as well as unloading trucks.the environment that I worked in was a very family oriented, everyone was very helpful with any questions that I had abut my work."
good,The customers are horrible and management sucks. The atmosphere is not worth it and I feel sorry for the people working there because they never open up enough cash registers
good,Local management was great. I wasn't paid nearly enough for the level of work they had me doing. Tire technician is not something everyone can do. Not to mention I was the only tech for a while.
good,"Easy warehouse work "
good,If your someone that can work in an environment that can put up with  unprofessional management system Then you can go at all cost. Good luck ........
good,Hard work due to being constantly understaffed. You will have to do the job of multiple people almost everyday. Breaks are few and far between if you get them at all.
good,"Every new hire has a learning curve and pharmacy staff needs to be trained on the software.  Instead of staff competing amongst each other, collaboration and common goal should be emphasized."
good,"es una buena empresa para trabajar, eh aprendido mucho pero no he tenido oportunidades para promocionar."
good,"There is always something that needs to be worked at Walmart. Coworkers are for the most part friendly and work hard. I have a set routine usually everyday, so I almost always know what my responsibilities are."
good,Its a good job. I enjoyed how management was nice and the hardest part was really the time limits on finishing pallets of merchandise but besides that ok job
good,Be well established as a person if you have a family. Do not have small children and work the role I'm in. There is no balance in it. other than that it's not a bad job.
good,"As with any retail employment, Walmart offered a little overtime around the holidays and then when January hit, my hours were cut to bare bones, as in maybe 8 hours per week. Also, my schedule never looked anything similar from week to week, so cross out making any plans like going back to college or trying to work in another job."
good,"They did schedule around my availability, but that meant I would never have a manager position. Some managers do not care about the employees and the job itself. I never felt so disrespected by a company before."
good,I hope that they will turn the store around & start hiring more people. I was always happy to help & looking forward to work. Management is very poor!
good,"mi evaluacin es mala ya que RH no hace bien su trabajo, solo haciendo preferencias, y no respetando los lineaminentos, aun asi aunque hallalinea de asociados, para reportar"
good,"full time is 33 to 36 hours a week, not enough hours and NOT GOO PAY. I love the people I work with. fast pace. A lot of theft of costumers with walking out the door. not enough security"
good,"The interview process is a sham. Most probably you are selected based on your face. "
good,"You give an inch, they will take a mile. Management is hit or miss, and bad management isn’t dealt with by corporate. Toxic environment and low morale. No work/life balance. You will live there as a salaried manager. The benefits and pay is pretty good. Career advancement can be difficult unless you know someone or have someone important batting for you. Good days were 11 hours, bad days were 18 hours. were 11"
good,"Overall decent job. Workers are not the greatest , seeing as they hire whoever . Work environment is also decent . Have to pick up mostly everyone else’s slack with no repercussions."
good,There have been a lot of changes to walmart since my first day. The changes help with the cashiers and anybody on the frontend. But sometimes its frustrating.
good,At the store I worked at the managers were switched almost every month so no one knew who was doing what when.  If there has been some continuity it may have been a better work environment.
good,could have been better. I miscarried a child two days after I was fired. the week prior I needed to leave and they didn't allow me to and I complain about being dizzy while having to be over this big deep fryer.
good,"Scheduling and family do not work out with Walmart. Assistant managers constantly deny time off request for lack of coverage even it the request is in advance. "
good,Hated working for walmart not family oriented whatsoever i have special needs children it was the worst experience and worst job i couldve ever had had great customers
good,"Although they have raised the minimum wage here, the hours are still inconsistent. They don’t allow overtime and if sales are low you will not work your full schedule. They don’t seem to understand that our bills don’t go away just because sales were down. Not reliable income and too high expectations from management."
good,Walmart Needs to have better management. Also they need to treat managers and associates as equals.bug overall helping people is the best part. When you I start to see familiar faces everyday and people remember who you are it’s a good feeling
good,"i was given the responsibility of maintaining the meat department by stocking shelves,rotating stock and removing outdated products.i maintained the back room by rotating stock and checking dates on products.i removed and disposed of all outdated products.i picked orders by using hand held scanner to pick and stock products"
good,"Typical Walmart; low prices on a lot of things although some things are  cheaper at Target. You just have to comparison-shop!  A lot of Riff Raff walking around in the store.  I am currently wearing a cast on my leg and they do not have enough  riding carts  for people with disabilities.  But, in comparison between 3 Veterinary medicine pharmacies, prescription medication for my cat is much cheaper here, as recommended by my veterinarian!  You have to take the pros with the cons sometimes."
good,"High volume and stressful at times."
good,"A typical work place , I enjoyed my job and employees my manger was very nice and helpful I started as a stock worker and groceries and became a supervisor in dairy and I learned a lot"
good,Travailler avec eux en tant que caissière était très stressant. Il y a beaucoup de personnes pour qui cet emploi doit bien leur aller mais plusieurs d'autres que non. Le plus difficile était la rapidité avec laquelle il fallait servir les clients surtout durant le temps des fêtes.
good,"After working for Walmart for over 8 years, and after now having worked for two other retail companies, I see that Walmart really isn't all that bad of a company to work for. There are some very horrible assistant managers, co-managers, and store managers, and I do think that corporate should help their workers more."
good,Love being able to help someone out when they can't find an item. Being able to get them the things that they came in to get is amazing. Happy customer means returning to shop again and sales for the company.
good,I transferred to this Walmart to work part time cashier while going to school and they were not willing to work with my schedule. I had to call him three times because they schedule me during a class and they told me that I just have to be there.
good,"I like it because of the difference opportunities to grow and advance in the company. In addition, the fact that the company is pretty flexible is a plus."
good,"When I went into the interview, I got hired the same day. I started work a few days after I got hired. It was a fast paced environment. I put food on shelves and opened boxes. I worked in the food part of the store, but I also worked in other parts of the store too by stocking things on shelves and helping customers."
good,I did quality checks on online orders. made sure the package matched what the customer ordered. I did inventory control using am mp40 and a stock pucker. I corrected return errors.
good,"Walmart management lacks a good management, they do not take their job seriously. A depressing work environment"
good,"Great place to work for laid back it's a good second job because hours are slim  3 days a week, 12 hour days on during winter season the rest of the year it's slow 40 hours every two weeks."
good,Walmart is currently cutting positions and making them all sales associates or cap teams. They dropped greeters for cart checkers and dropped assblers to hire out because it saves them money from late winter to spring when they don't sell as many bikes or grills
good,Bad work culture with little opportunity for advancement. But pay is very fair for the area. They raise their standards but yet they treat their employees less fairly.
good,"I worked in the ACC.  We were short staff and management would not hire the minimum required staff.  Also, management had a ""do as I say, not as I do"" mentality."
good,"Walmart does not pay their employees enough. For the amount of work that they have you do, they do not pay you enough. Walmart is a billion dollar company and they try to overwork their employees. They don't even give holiday pay"
good,"I liked my job but the people are drama as with most places, but my department manager and HR did excellent in fixing isssues and they will try to keep you happy and give you what you need. Training could be better."
good,"Pharmacists were supportive and caring (excluding the head pharmacist), they celebrate your strengths and allow you to try new tasks and grow personally. Probably due to the caliber of people in the area, I only recall two irate patients. Role itself can become repetitive very easily, it is however a good source of entry level experience"
good,Walmart has taught me customer service skills and has given me the confidence to move on to bigger and better jobs. The worst part of the job is the scheduling and having to work every weekend.
good,"You punch in you go to your area look it over restock and clean as needed. Help any customers that look like they need it. "
good,"it's not a hard job, what is hard is having the patience to deal with rude and tough customers and sometimes even managers who pressure some associates to complete many jobs in one shift"
good,"Walmart is most definitely not a fun place to work at"
good,"They are great not very dependable nor do they take care of you regarding being contagious or sick in any way, their management team isn’t the bet at helping solve problems they are not a trust worthy work place."
good,"As with most retail positions, most employees are part-time, with number of assigned work hours being inconsistent, making it difficult to have multiple jobs, which is a requirement just to make ends meet. Hours can be reduced without notice, while this is convenient to meet the WalMart bottom line, it does not help employees who have bills to pay. Unfortunately, rent does not decrease when hours do. This is a problem with retail in general and WalMart is not alone in this practice."
good,"If you are a newcomer or a student, then Walmart is a good workplace for starting.  It pays $1 more than minimum and is brave enough to trust you as an inexperienced workforce."
good,"While they pay a decent wage for retail, they are more focused on making money than keeping employees and customers happy. They did commit to community involvement."
good,Walmart wasn't a bad place. It's just time for me to get a different job that pays more and is closer to home. I learned what it is like to have a job as it was my first one. I'm happy with the experience I gained from Wal-Mart.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time working for Walmart but could never advance up even though I passed every management test and fellow associates said that I should be manager. Policies change and managers are very partial to other associates.  Kind of a high school environment with cliques and drama. Starting pay goes up frequently. Usually it's $11 to start. If you volunteer to put on different ""hats"" on you won't be compensationed for it."
good,"I went in, knowing I'm not great with the public. Guess who was constantly posted on a register?"
good,To many chiefs.not enough Indians to follow or do the work...Well the work is always on the go... First shift gets the heaviest part of the day...Then the later shifts get to relax...
good,"Walmart is a good place to make money when your in that pinch financially. You're not living the life of a king/queen but you're getting by. The biggest issue is getting the Hours you want, and knowing where you're going to be working. I can't tell you the number of times I've gone into work looking at what I was going to be doing and getting told as I come in no we need you in these 2 other departments at the same time."
good,The job itself isnt hard. At all! Just the people are horrible and do not want to do the things Walmart trains you. They do them their own way and dont know how to work hard. Management is never there to check how things are going.
good,"Overall a great organization for those willing to put the time and effort in. I worked my way up from a part time associate in high school to a manager supervising stores in two states. Decided to hang it up after 20 years in the business and look for a job without all the overnight travel 3-6 days per week. This company can be incredibly rewarding and offer impressive compensation if you are willing to give the level of commitment and effort in order to earn it. Like most retail management positions plan to work very long hours with a sacrifice in work/life balance, but if you are seeking compensation/bonus potential and a career path that can let you work all over the country this is a really great business that you can learn a lot of different skills in."
good,"Walmart isn’t the worse job in the world. Healthcare, pto, discounts, and more, Walmart has a lot to offer. But these benefits are only there to keep you around and blind you from the poor management and work you have to do. Work is stressful and fast paced, but management makes things complicated. Lack of compassion seems to lack from my experiences and I worked at two different stores."
good,"I work as a personal shopper and its very stressful most times. If you have 100+ orders theres almost no respect for anyone. Its pick or be plucked out of the system. Anyways I mostly do dispensing and the dumbest thing they want us to do now is look ""froofy"". dress up in orange, wear ridiculous things on your head, wear a cape (like were some kind of superhero), basically wear anything orange you can possibly put on your body. Im not some kind of roadside atraction! absolutely humiliating."
good,"The company itself is great, they to care about their workers. That said, when it comes to individual stores, your mileage WILL vary. The store I work at took a massive chance in hiring me, I had no real experience to show, and in all honesty i looked kind of rough, but, they took the chance and hired me. I will always be grateful for that. Then as the time carried on, different management came in, and what started as an actually gratifying job quickly turned into some of the most stressful days I had really dealt with. If you happened to miss one irrelevant thing when they demand you focus on another thing that they say will result in you being terminated if you fail, only to be reamed for missing (as and example) a single mint wrapper that was behind a monitor when you were told to focus on doing a complete strip/wax on 2 action alleys in one night by yourself, then also ream you for not getting the wax perfect while you were by yourself. "
good,"All though I enjoyed the fast pace and opportunistic job working at Walmart, I felt as though the employees at almost all levels are set up for failure. With a task loud that requires double the amount of time, a lack of communication between upper management, and a constant shortage of scheduling on top of already expected employee call outs, it seems as though Walmart takes the theory of pushing their employees to greatness to an extreme. This causes employees to become warn out and exhausted faster, feel unappreciated and lose motivation to succeed because of feeling inadequate."
good,I would recommend this job for someone who has great social skills and likes to work at a fast-pace. I really enjoyed working here but when the holidays are over the season starts to really slow down and hours are cut short and theres no over-time.
good,Management doesnt look at associates as assets. They are treated poorly. Make promises of promotion but doesnt happen. Spread DM to thin. Dont encourage associates with positive feedback
good,"Walmart is a good job to work at, great benefits and all but the job is unorganized.  To get paid only $11 a hour isn’t enough to get paid biweekly and the amount of work you do."
good,I honestly feel like Walmart is a great company to work for but like any other company it has its pros and cons . I’m very thankful to be working for them for 7 years now .
good,"customers are terrible and all of the management team is either extremely busy or really lazy, raises are rare and alot of your time will be spent picking up other employees work"
good,You only get time off if you suck up to management or are extremely lazy  the hard workers never get a vacation or any other time off then the 2 days they normally get
good,Hardest part of working at walmart is the pay. The pay is decent but the changes that get done you will make less for the work they make you do. 2% of base pay just doesn't help.
good,"At first working there was fun depending on the manager."
good,"I enjoyed my job even with how chaotic it could be at times. It was worth the stress until it wasn't. The associates of the store eventually were poorly managed and I couldn't take the stress of it all. "
good,They train you to do the your job correctly but won't let you do it then proceeded to coach you that you aren't doing your job because you are doing someone eleses they pick favorites and give less qualified people management jobs
good,"they never stop hiring, you nothing but a number, can easily be replace."
good,Working at Walmart for me was a complete learning experience with the material they provide for you it's very easy work and working as a team you get the job done to your best ability
good,Management never understood how hard are job was outside and were always breathing down are backs they would always assume things and curtain things would make us look bad
good,"Management was never organized and they don’t show enough care towards there workers and more about sales the company is making. Also, there aren’t really a lot of benefits to working there."
good,"I worked the overnight shift and my position was physically demanding. We worked hard all night for 8 hours, got an hour break, but they over work you for what they pay. But if you need money you will do the work."
good,It was a great place to work until just recently when things started to change. The higher management started getting worse and made it hard to work with. The hardest part of the job was handling angry customers. Most enjoyable part was being able to run a functional front end and making sure things went smooth on the days I worked.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was always meeting new and different people from all walks of life and making new friends in all the stores I ever worked in. The associates always banned together like family.
good,working there I wasn’t treated very well. The managers were always switching and they are very inattentive. They didn’t treat there cashiers well and never gave us hours .
good,"It has been ever changing!! Nothing stays the same. Management sometimes have picks. The pay scale is not fair. People that they hire now, can come in making more than someone that has been working for several years. No adjustment is made to the longer term associates."
good,Management is a joke. The old managers could take charge the new ones are more immature they gossip about there associates personal business to other associates. They dont know how to lead there team into success they only know how set them up for failure. The overnight staff are over worked and underpaid. There is no respect for the staff. I do not tolerate bullying. Keyy alert!! Do your work go home. You dont get paid enough to care. Take your time. To get it done it done just in time.for you to clock out an go home.
good,Is a good place to work if you dont mind fast paced work and being directed by multiple people to do a multitude of different tasks. Overall the culture is better as far as respecting the individual and giving ownership to associates.
good,"Stressful job with lack of advancement opportunities. "
good,"Walmart, as a company, when I first started was a really enjoyable company to work for.  Over the 15 years I spent working for the company it slowly went downhill.  They slowly started taking away our incentives for working for them. "
good,"I have learned a lot working there, you get to meet people, help customers and have fun at the same time. When i started it was some what different because things keep changing but if you like hard work Walmart is the place for you. About Management cannot say much because its a constant change, one day you have a boss next in a few months another but other than that its ok"
good,"It started out as a Great PT job and I went full time because of the pay! They pay great and the benefits are good! But there is NO job security, and just because you do your job does not guarantee you will keep it in yet another restructure."
good,If you like being treated like a dog and over worked and like to complain a lot and hurting more than working than Walmart is a great place to work because I was support manager and I had to leave
good,"it was an okay place to work benefits are good management is okay. Salary is okay could be more, don’t really care if you’re sick or not. paid time off"
good,Benefits keep changing. Positions change or eliminated often. No longer have human resource personal. Pay was okay for a starter job. Not really a place for advancement.
good,"Greeting and ringing up customers purchases, helping customers find things, solving customers problems, how to help customers, understanding customer rights,"
good,Very difficult to advance in the company. Raises are advertized but contacting a superior is impossible. No superior available to reach out to if a problem arises. Stocking environment was good for me. The people there are very friendly and the work got done easily because we all worked as a team.
good,There is a lot of opportunity for lower management  jobs but if your looking to move up or become  a store manger the opportunity is few and far between
good,There is no job security at Walmart. You don't know from one week to the next if you will be given any hours. One member of management in particular at my location speaks to employees and customers very poorly
good,Walmart was a great company to work for. Now they are going down. Management is weak and the professionalism no longer exists in many of the stores. Working there was an experience that's for sure
good,"Mostly short staffed, big work loads are put onto each associate. Department managers are not picked wisely. Slack organization, managers are lazy, leaving the associates to do everything."
good,They job its self was fine  butthe management  was horrible they would treat you horrible  but the customers were amazing i kept working  because of the customers
good,"The pay is on the higher end of retail management, however they will get what they are paying for. Expect long days, days off often cancelled without comp days to off set"
good,Supervised and trained 10 + employees with main focus on high quality of customer service while motivating employees to deliver top performance.    Managed merchandise/ restocking and insuring new inventory was property added to the floor
good,The hardest part of the job is that when you don't have any people to work with you because they either quit or have the day off and the managers want the floor filled for the customer and there are only 2 if us then there is a problem because there's not enough people to do what is needed.
good,"This was a fun place to work for quite some time. I can't say that I loved working here because of the people. I just loved the job in general. The people I worked with were a plus, but then over time I got burnt out and needed a change of scenery. It's not the best place to work, but if you stick with it, it can be a fantastic job."
good,I loved my team. Upper management really ruins the walmart culture. Upper management does not know what they are doing. Very unethical and my former store manager was known to throw a fit and cuss associates out. It got really bad.
good,I learned in this environment you have to be able to control your emotions and be able to calmly and respectfully help your customers in the best way possible.
good,"I like working there but there are things that could be better. There are some elements I don't care for. For example, there is a seniority element that is not official."
good,You must be within the managers favorites in order to gain hours or to move up. Work flow is sometimes very stressful and schedule is always different.
good,"working at Walmart is a good job for someone with no work experience or for someone attending school. fast paced, timely and always helping someone. spent most of my time on the sells floor assisting customers."
good,Walmart are okay job to work for but I can't say much about it just needs to give hours or communicate to associates about the hours. That's all I have to say.
good,"The management team (upper and lower) needs to listen to the associates more. When policy changes come down, there needs to be a better explanation as to why. A lot is expected of you."
good,Walmart is a good starter job. Not too hard for good minimum wage. Stocking shelves is very precise and you are timed which makes it difficult to finish your aisle on time
good,very busy environment. it is physically demanding at times.  have a wide variety of customers and co workers. management is willing to work with staff to accommodate if a family emergency happens.
good,Wal-Mart is not the same place that it was when I started. Customers are not happy with the changes. There are some great people that work there. Under staffed!
good,"Very welcoming from day one, the pay is good for a first job . If you need benefits and aren't looking for advancement it's not a bad job. If you try to get your job done and meet expectations you can get all of the independence you earn."
good,"unload trucks, stock shelves and clean up after yourself. best part was leaving for the day. depending on manager depends on type of day you will have"
good,"fast paced work environment, must be able to work with minimal supervision and multitask. Especially busy during the holidays. May be asked to do other duties as well"
good,walmart agreat company fast pace typical day maint aclean safe store and good custormer service the hardest part of the job trying to please everyone the best part the custermer some times younger employers dont listen
good,I would only recommend this job because of the pay. There are really no benefits and most management are rude or completely ignore their employees needs.
good,"Don’t give a lot of hours, have me working a 8hr shift in 6 hours with no help. They change my schedule a lot. You do have pto in case you need to call in and late, that’s good."
good,"Walmart wasn't a bad company overall. Just bad management. They pay decently for the work you do. The only problem with some stores is if you aren't in  little group with the managers, don't expect to move up."
good,"Walmart can be a great place, it can also be a sad place.  This solely depends on your management team and the company direction.  Great management makes all the difference."
good,"When I expressed getting injured at work and that I needed help or needed to be transfered to a different department, they ignored my requests."
good,The scheduling needs  Help because it keeps changing on every associate And madrik canting do agree on anything like  Who to send to what location or how many people they need in what Area
good,"Not much of work life balance . Management was fair, enjoyed working with my co workers. Health insurance offered after 90 days. Employee discount. Small bonus."
good,It was okay but there were a lot of lazy co workers they almost never keep their work space areas cleaned the work was hard definitely on the holidays and Black Friday
good,This Walmart was really busy all the time so I had to think fast and be on my feet all day. I made plenty of close friends and we would all help each other when we needed it.
good,"Management was just utterly horrible, they had people working full time hours but listed them in the computer as part time so they never got any of the benefits of working FULL TIME!"
good,"The garden dept was my favorite spot. Something I'm good at. Often they would move me to electrics or sports which I know nothing about. Cashiering they were always attentive to breaks and emergency issues, but would abandon me in other depts."
good,"On a typical day six associates unload an average truck of about 3300 pieces box by box. I've learned how to operate a forklift, pallet jack/power pallet jack, walkie stacker, cash register, paint machine and key machine. Our head manager is very nice and professional but other members of management are not so. Work culture is too provide best atmosphere for customers and associates. The hardest part part is being overworked and under appreciated. Most enjoyable part is helping customers"
good,"Was a interesting experience, the Holiday scheduling was out of hand, it made it stressful, and was it worth it. .Nothing more to say. Nothing more to say. Nothing more to say,Thank You"
good,"It's a good place to work. "
good,With Walmart if you're sick or hurting and the doctor gives you a work excuse Walmart won't accept it and they only allow you to miss 5 days in a  six month period and even if a doctor doesn't want you to work Walmart still counts it against you and also you have to build up your vacation hours and Walmart will not let anyone unless your a manager take vacation time around Thanksgiving and Christmas
good,"Honestly when you start working at Walmart as a stocker they expect you to learn the entire store in days and reprimand you if you move too slowly despite not knowing what you're doing. As a cashier they give you much more leeway in learning and the amount of time you take, making it a more enjoyable experience."
good,"Constantly changing. Nothing stays the same for more than 3 weeks. They pay you just enough so you never can afford to leave, make you take  promotion to transfer... oh and your schedule is never consistent unless you have friends in high places. Nuff said!"
good,"I love the job itself and most of my coworkers, however we are very short staffed. We are one of the busier pharmacies, so being short staffed it’s easy to get behind and overwhelmed."
good,"they say that they care about their employees, but they dont, the only thing they care is production and they will make you work non stop just. they will send security guys to make sure that you are working safe, but if you need anything fix you wont see anybody that can fix anything."
good,It was a good experience for a first job being a cashier but maybe I would like it more if I went back doing something other than being a cashier maybe something like a stocker or the meat department
good,"When I was hired I was grateful to have a chance to work and grow in this company and make a good change from working starter jobs that didn't challenge my mind."
good,It’s not a bad job. Better than most. Depending on the manager it was relaxed. The flow of people that would come in would make the day go by really fast.
good,The hardest part of the job is making a coustmer happy when they already have it in their thoughts that it will be a negative experience. Most enjoyable part is when you have a coustmer leave the store smiling because they are satisfied
good,"As an assistant managerof the store, and the higher you move up in the company, the more work is demanded of you and more time is spent in the store than with your home life."
good,"I have requested several times for opportunities to advance, When I first became department manager, I had no training. I had to get help from other department managers to learn my job. Eventually I was asked to come to the front and become a costumer service manager. Because of my skills with people. and I have been passed up on two opportunities to advance"
good,"Bad management."
good,"My current job is being eliminated. The others I have been offered there do not interest me."
good,Bad management. Bad associates. You work like you are a robot with a speed level of 100. The pay rate is not worth the amount of work or lack of respect.
good,"Work day was lame, they didn’t teach me anything I had to learn on the fly. Management was lazy and horrible, culture of the job was not good, hardest part of the job was dealing with management, the most enjoyable part would be pay day."
good,long days and lots of hours. associates with pride. management is very bad and not engaging at all. turnover was an issue. training was lacking sometimes also.
good,"I make a lot of friends at this place. Stressful though, lack of communication at store and equipment, hard to access job. Have to push people to do things around store or get things done even people at higher level."
good,I had a good experience the pay was good they treated me well till they cut my hours then it got to the point yo where I couldn't afford bills or other basic necessities
good,"The job was alright in the beginning but as time went on we got a new store manager and basically everything went downhill from there, along with new sets of rules that didn’t make sense that EVERYONE had to abide and no one was too happy about those changes."
good,I care for my 94 year old mother asked to be put on day so I could continue working as was the days I did have day time hours Assistant change to all night....knowing I took care of my mom after 3pm...
good,The experience working at Walmart was challenging. There was little support from upper management for Area Managers. Production goals were expected to be made but  was not supported when holding associates accountable when they fell below goal. The manager was always made to feel responsible even when the associate was clearly fabricating information.
good,"Work by urgency shorthand ,unbearable  condition,billing insurances,rushing  cash register,much needed time for a change customers  complain  about waiting  in long lines"
good,A typical day at Walmart was fairly easy. Assisting customers was almost always easy - perhaps the easiest part of the job. The hardest part of the job was working in receiving where there wasn't any air conditioning.
good,"I enjoyed everything while working at Walmart but the only thing that I did not like is that there is not much growth. For example, I have been working here for more than a year. I was expecting promotion and some pay increment but none of these happened to me."
good,"Walmart is an okay place to work. Nothing great about it, but flexible schedule and if you work your way up to management you get a decent few perks but a diminished work/life balance"
good,"Bad work environment, very little concerned with employee skills and safety. In addition, the salary was pitiful for the accomplished work. In addition we did not have enough poses compared to what we were doing. All the staff lacked professionalism and did not care about the importance of their performance. Due to the lack of an employee, they hired anyone and this was reflected on the level of service offered"
good,got my pharmacy training here on the job. filled doctors prescriptions. placed otc and ppharmacy orders and also put them away. counted pills and made compounds
good,"Store level management was fantastic. Great crew/staff support. Busy, even hectic at times, but fun, too.  Processes are straightforward.  Initial training could use improvement."
good,"It wasn't fun by any means and my ending to my time there was horrible, but my personal department, produce, was a good learning experience."
good,"If you have a family or are a single parent, Walmart my not be the company for you. Work life balance is horrible. Work and expectations of the company are often unrealistic and and be very stressful"
good,Nothing special .management is full of themselves. The culture changed and became about beating Amazon and not about the customer. Dms are not the backbone.
good,the job was pretty tough at first but once you get used to it its fine but then management changed and the jobs changed and lots of people got fired because they wanted people to work harder rather than keep peoples jobs
good,Review was ok. Management was alright. I worked hard every day showed up early every day. Got a perfect attendants. Worked nights for eight years. Worked 2 years on the afternoon shift.
good,"My main gripe about Wal-Mart was they only paid minimum wage foe certain positions, no matter what your work experience is. Otherwise it was not a terrible place to work."
good,Over all decent place to work I just feel the pay scale could be a lot better then what it is currently and room for advancement  and it should be equal between male and female .
good,Nothing to really say about the review Walmart is s great company but the management team needs work it's a great work environment but once again the management team needs improvement in
good,Good people but lack of investigation into claims of sexism and hostile work environment. Good benefits and flexible hours depending on position. All full time positions except cashiering currently being changed to shifts that are not good for parents.
good,"Too much favoritism, favorites talk/act inappropriately, assocs talk/facetime on phones ignoring customers,Mgmt doesn't promote respect/diversity, not all company guidelines are followed"
good,Not a bad place to work but managment can be better. They like to work you hard but it keeps you busy all day.. I liked the people I worked with.. Worked in Home Goods..
good,"I left Walmart to retire.  I was tired trying to find the associates who worked in the department, they were to busy socializing.  Management has its pets."
good,Loved what I did and most of my coworkers but company changes in policy conflicts with my beliefs and most likely the law. I would recommend getting things in writing.
good,"Coworkers were pretty much hit or miss, more bad customers than there were good, management didn't really show that they cared about their workers, only one or two did. Overall it wasn't the worst place to work, but the environment was mostly negative."
good,They will hire you for said shift and then expect you to fill in the gaps when people call in. Usually it’s in a department you know nothing about too!
good,"They frequently change policies to try to make things better but in the long run it is hurting the company.  They do not make a pay difference for long term employees compared to new hires. The hardest part of the job is the customer complaints to cashiers which they have no control over such as items being moved, discontinued, or out of stock.  I enjoy working with the public and being able to help them especially the elderly. Sometimes a smile and a gentle help gets them thru a rough moment."
good,This company is not family oriented. They can care less about your family and management do there own thing. They dont even follow the company rules and regulations. Plus the open door policy sucks because the store mgr will always take the assistant's side.
good,"Every day I spent at the store in my position had some degree of physical and/or emotional toll, but I got paid enough to easily cover a particularly nasty student loan, so it was a fair enough balance. Having to push so many carts, often above the set limit to keep the higher management happy, was rough. The people I worked with at the front end were mostly wonderful, however; they were empathetic. We were a pack, so to speak. Even some of the management I have had good experiences with."
good,"All in all, Walmart is a job. It is not a great place for a career until you reach upper management, which is currently easier to get to from outside the company than within. For the most part, lazy associates will get away with anything and everything, and your hard work will be rewarded with even more work at no additional benefit to you whatsoever. But if you're looking for a job to have while you go to school or just something to get by for now, they pay alright enough and are more or less willing to work with your schedule."
good,"it was decent working there, I could not. get along with middle management. "
good,"Night shift is not for everyone, that being said if you give it what you got you'll be working for someone else. Great crew, sucky job. Overall it slowly drains you. If you have a family this position may not be for you."
good,I worked Walmart almost 9 years . My pay rate lower than people new hiring. Team Management treated u associate not well. New hiring people don’t get training much .
good,"I’ve witnessed favoritism being shown and it’s unfair to those of us who work hard to give excellent customer service."
good,Its a good first job if you dont know what you want to do at first. The job itself is kind of hard in the beginning because you are asked to do multiple things at one time.
good,ok place to work very labor intensive. people are great management is great as long as you keep to yourself and dont make any friends. There Target numbers are near impossible to hit and you only get 3 strikes before termination
good,As an eCommerce fulfillment associate you can expect to have a large number of orders to fulfill everyday.  Time management skills are integral to success.
good,"Walmart is an okay job for part-time during high school or college. I would possibly not make a career out of it, but there are some to be found. Paid reasonable."
good,Was able to be myself without having managers all over my shoulders it was very relaxed and fast paced the only issues was the hours working there ok.
good,"Management wasn't fair all across the board. The job wasn't a hard job at all. I actually enjoyed my job at Walmart. I unloaded the trucks then stocked merchandise on the shelves, interacted with customers and helped my co-workers when needed. I learned how to use a stand up forklift, pallet jacks and conveyor belt while working there."
good,"come in on 3rd cleaned bathrooms, floors, office, transfered to cap 1 go in freezer down stack and stock items to shelf, unload trucks, we had a couple good manaqgers, but most of them was hateful and disrespectful"
good,"I worked at Walmart for a few months. The interview process was fairly easy and they offered me a job on the spot. It took about a week to get orientation set up, and orientation was pretty lengthy. Afterwards, you would come back about a week later, and return to the same room where you did orientation to get trained on a computer (which takes forever and is super boring). Starting pay is $11 and you get good benefits (discounts, stock options, educational opportunities, 401K, etc.) after working there for three months. However, management was frowned upon. As a cashier, I would heavily rely on management for some duties, and they would take forever to respond. Sometimes they would forget about my breaks, and one manager scheduled me for a time I wasn't supposed to work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with stress from the customers, but it can be fun to get to know some of them and hear their stories. I enjoyed the pay and some of the people I worked with. Overall, it is a decent place to work depending on your needs."
good,"Working here is what you make of it and finding the department that works best for you. I loved the fresh dept, but the store management is what really killed my interest."
good,"During my time at Walmart I was constantly having to work different sections other than mine. My schedule wasn’t consistent, some weeks I would be off only one day in the week. My managers did try their best to work with me and the issues I had."
good,"I enjoyed working there. My coworkers were great. Benefits were wonderful however it took me over a year to receive them. Wasnt really good job security. You never knew what employees were going to get in trouble for that week. They liked keeping employees, at least Cashiers on a thin line."
good,"Walmart was an OK job. I went threw 3 interviews with each being a different manager. Training took a few days with a whole gift being on a computer in HR. The lady that did the new hire orientation explained information that was inaccurate and caused about 3 employees, including myself a job. Even though she was at fault for the error, we still lost our job and were we could reapply in 90 days. Management definitely showed favoritism when it came to employees."
good,This job is not for everyone unless you enjoy doing retail work. It can be very stressful at times. The management for Walmart is very poor one of the reasons a lot of people quit
good,"There always seemed to be too many or not enough managers. One would tell you to do something, another would come along and tell you to do something else, making it hard to finish tasks given."
good,"Worked indoors stocking items as well as a cart boy for certain shifts. "
good,"they pay for your test to get certified, but there is rarely room to grow and upper management is exceedingly more unreasonable in expectations. I'm worried for patient safety at this point."
good,Young man who likes to Learn everyday.i love working and taking care of my family respect all my coworkers and always wishing the best wherever or whoever I know in my life
good,"Es una empresa con un muy buen ambiente de trabajo, con politica de puertas abiertas. "
good,You learn to work with cash register and about different products also product availability. Training new employees and about product call back's. keeping the work area clean and presentable.
good,I love working with the company but we have some poor management. I started in maintenance and moved up to a costomer Host. And I love working with costomer and greeting them into the store.
good,Retail stores like Walmart expects an applicant to be serious about doing a good job and show up for your scheduled shift. The jobs that I have had were not hard jobs but very intense and customer service related. An associate should be able to multitask.
good,"I worked at Walmart on two separate occasions. Both very different experiences. It went from being a family oriented place to a place of unfair policies and stress.No one is really happy there, people are mean and talk behind each others backs. There is not a lot of team work. There is an unfair absence policy and they have lost good workers over it. The work is not bad but not enjoyable. Customers are rude and entitled."
good,"A Typical day at work would be helping customers,stocking merchandise,cashiering. Finishing work assignments with co-workers."
good,Yes it's a job and they pay better than most places but not as much as they could. Management is mainly there for themselves uncaring not understanding. You are just another body to fill the store until you leave. Not very family friendly. Single father of 2 kids and they were unwilling to adjust my schedule so I could be home when my children are home.
good,"Easy job to get into. They're always hiring as they loose as many as they hire. The pay isn't that great and you'd be an idiot expecting to get any pay raises other than store wide increases. Managers suck, there's a few good ones who seem to do all the work for the others."
good,The managers were not great people to their employees. not enough hours hardly any overtime. The employees were always against each other for promotions and more pay.
good,They typically throw you into things without you having been trained well enough for your comfort.  Plans are always changing and if you happen to be one of the individuals that actually do your job and do it well you end up having to do everyone else's job too.
good,Working at Walmart isn't a great job. The management is bad and there is no full time. It's an alright starting job to get on your feet.... THAT'S IT!!
good,enjoyed working the dairy and frozen areas until i was pulled. then thier new attendance policy is not abide by accross the board. also the hours to work were very good.
good,"Walmart was a really nice place to work generally speaking. Overall I would, more than likely, recommend this job to the majority of my current friends and associates."
good,I worked from 2-11 so I was there during rush hours. It would get so crazy in there u want to pull your hair out. The  associates were really nice when I first started working there.
good,"At Walmart and Sam's Club , you learn about team work. They teach you time management and several different skills . The company will teach you to run your own business if you have the drive to learn."
good,"Most tasks and positions inside a Wal-mart distribution are repeat task oriented positions. Management is handcuffed by employee favoring policies, and employees are treated like numbers so 5 steps and your out."
good,"The work is very easy and the other workers are very friendly. You learn how to deal with all different kinds of people. Overall, I would recommend working here if this is your first job."
good,"i hate to say this but i am going to. walmart can be a great place to work for but they do have some horrible and stupid managers. but not all are that way. some of the managers are smart, understanding, and great people. but the worst part of walmart is like some other jobs. it is the urgency of getting positions filled so their associates are not getting over worked for long periods of time. for me my position should have 10 associates in that area. this way we could have 5-7 associates on a day but we have had 6-7 associates for the last three months at the low we have had 5 for a week. and at the high in the last 3 months was 7. but 3 of them was new associates to the company that needed to be fully trained into the job not just trained into what that area of the store needs to learn. if a person transferred from a different area of the store to the area i work only need to learn the quality and main process of that area. but a new associate needs to learn not just the quality they need to look for, the speed, where product needs to go, what product we work, but also how to use the hand held devices. which takes more time for training. also we have long term associates that work in that area and we have vacation times and we would like to take it but we also do not want to short the rest of our crew so we do not use our vacation time so that we have enough people to work the area and not overload the rest of the crew. but the upper managers only see how what is on the paper, the numbers we are hitting, the fact we are able to get the main job done with so little, and the"
good,"I work in the Supply Chain division of Walmart. Lots of hours because work day is determined by demand. If people buy more, we work longer hours. I average 50 hours a week. Work/life balance is not good as I am always working and have little time for much else on the weekend as they mandate people to work every weekend. Management is both good and bad. Some are horrible, others are awesome. Get on the right shift and you’ll enjoy it."
good,Very stressful and unappealing because I didn’t have much time to do things that I would have liked to outside of work. The employees and managers were caring and working with customers was great but when I had to rush I felt a lot of pressure to do my work and that of my coworkers
good,I learned a lot about different drugs as to what they are used for. I got the opportunity to have a lot of patient interaction which enhanced my learning experience.
good,"Walmart’s a job if your in between jobs,  management is horrible, over 18 years Walmart has taken away more from me then they have given, raises are only 2% to everyone. The first 8 years were good but it’s gone down hill since, Would be hard pressed to find anybody in my store that likes working there and it stems from bad Management"
good,"I worked CAP team 2 and knew from the start the group was in low supply of labor due to all of us interviewees being asked several times to recommend this job to any friends or family we had. After the first month, we dropped to only 6 on the team. We were each expected to pick up the slack left by the lack of employees, and everyone was responsible for doing the work of 2 people. Even though I was one of the few to finish MY work in time, I was still blamed and regarded as not fast enough. The management was poor: our one supervisor was someone who hated our team and requested to transfer. All together, Walmart paid decent money for a min wage job and offered a good amount of hours (40 hrs a week) but it was not worth the experience I had."
good,"not good management, however for a starting out job the pay is good, otherwise I wouldn't recommend working there for a day to day job. only something to get you through high school."
good,aggressive work environment. very competitive. physical labor puts strain on the weak bodied. requires full devotion and energy especially during the holidays.
good,As a manager there was more tasks assigned weekly than other chains and less support on implementation of new programs. While there was frequent changes on the current top objective there was not any calibration to the local market.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart, I would recommend this job for anyone that doesn't mind constantly working and talking to other people. The only Reason for me leaving is because I had problems with my pregnancy."
good,"Walmart is cool to work for. They don’t pay you very good. But you get discounts, but you’re lucky if they actually give you the full 40hrs a week. For a part one job it’s ok but not if you are the only one working."
good,I worked part time there in high school it was nothing special. It was some were to work to get easy money. The management was lazy that’s all I have to say.
good,"Interview: I waited for about 2 hours before any manager actually talked to me, all the while associates were going back there for me to tell them I was there. They also took about 3 months to review my application and invite me for an interview. The actual interview process was quick, like any other interview. There were 3 different interviews and I was offered the job on the spot. Management doesnt seem to really care about anyone except the company. Coworkers are nice a lot of the time but none of us felt treated fairly so most people did the bare minimum. I got paid a decent wage. I got discounts, but they arent very good for anything and I got paid time off. They are very strict about how many days you miss."
good,Working at Walmart was O.K. but they need to work with the workers thoughts. Sometimes the worker knows more about their area than the supervisor. They need to listen to their workers when it comes  to ideas. They have a system called the Walmart way. Sometimes the Walmart way causes them to lose a lot more sales and money. Other than that it is an overall nice place to work as long as they are not so wishy washy.
good,"It was really fun to work there. It was more about the people. The management team was okay. As time went on, it got worse. Scheduling in my department was a horror when the most recent manager for electronics came in."
good,"A typical day was fine, as a cashier, I loved the work, and I got promoted before my training was completed. However my lack of completed training proved problematic in the new position as they sped trained me in the jewelry and shoe departments, and didn't provide much guidance and shoved me into solo shifts as the manager went on to maternity leave and we had to wait for the temporary replacement to learn what she could with no guidance at all. Also as a cashier, I was told that I would be working 40 hours a week but wasn't told that I was only part-time. Then, when I changed positions, they cut my hours drastically."
good,"Loved my job and helping the customers!  Did not love the constant changes the company makes, always changing policy and not always for the betterment of the jobs!! You would think big companies would support long term associates due to the knowledge of their job, not this company now days because,  they can get new associates and pay them less hourly rates!!"
good,It was pretty good place like any other job it has it up's and and down's .  Friendly co-worker's and professional as well. management was good and decent to a point like i said you have good people you work with and unprofessional and rude one's you work with.
good,"Typical days were slow, but you were expected to work harder than the day required. Hard workers were often given extra loads, and less breaks. Management tended to use negative reinforcement, and push you past limits. Nobody ever seemed happy to be there."
good,Working at walmart as a 6 7 and 8 month pregnant lady had its hardships but it was well worth it in the end. i learned a lot of new things working here
good,"Main duties include ringing up sales, bagging items, requesting price checks, honoring coupons, collecting payment and giving appropriate change. Responsible for counting the contents of cash register drawer at the end of each shift, maintaining receipts, records and withdrawals."
good,"There was no team spirit. I could not get anyone to train me, so I did not see an avenue for advancement.  I think the bonus structure incentivised selfish behavior."
good,"Walmart is a secure job that does provide plenty of hours if you need them. I never had a real issue with working for Walmart. The company allowed me to build social skills and save money for school while i was working fulltime. The turnover rate is super high here, and find several part time workers do not pull their own weight in departments. Walmart, to me, is a place to just get by while hoping for other career prospects. If one uses walmart for that sole purpose, then I think that it makes sense to work for Walmart."
good,No respect between management or supervisors with employees. Employees are not treated equally and get talked down too and have there jobs threatened.
good,"Walmart was a fun place to work in the beginning. I was not familiar with the culture, but after a few years, I soon began to see some favoritism, harassment, and unethical practices by fellow associates and management. I also witnessed a few managers break the WalMart core beliefs toward associates. "
good,"Very fast paced. Lots of clicks present in work force. Brown nosers work best in this company environments work force. If not a member of a click, you will not last long."
good,Walmart is a good place to work but they do not appreciate their employees. They wouldn’t work with my school schedule when I transferred to another store after the store I worked with closed. That is the reason I had to quit.
good,"Started as a garden associate, promoted within 2 weeks to supervisor. Rough start with tremendous challenges on a daily basis. Not much help in certain departments so it takes a lot of patience for the most part. Pay could be better and management as welll."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work depending on your career path. I dont feel like it is good for long term. Being an employee for 10 years, it is a draining company moreso due to unfair and improperly trained managers. If you want to be a manager, pharmacy tech, pharmacist, or optical employee, then walmart is a great 1st step."
good,"Walmart's culture has taken alot of hits over the years. If you need a job and are willing to work, they will find a position for you. Just don't expect any words of encouragement or thanks from the levels of management above you."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job were the people you work with. It is like having an extended family. Everyone works together to get the job requirements done.
good,Friendly poeple to work with.  Doing the same thing each day but each day has different challenges.  Always learning something new. Many advancement opportunities.
good,"while Walmart provided a good introduction to retail, that's all that it was, an introduction. the hours they scheduled me were strenuous and always as many as they could get before I could force them to make me full time. despite my many times going to my manager asking for full time because I needed the healthcare to pay for my medication, I was denied every time."
good,"Walmart can be a decent place to work if you happen to be placed with good coworkers and management. With occasional starting pay increases, you end up making the same amount (or even sometimes under) what newbies start at, which is upsetting for employees who have worked there longer. Management doesn't typically take terror threats seriously, which can be nerve-wracking for someone with severe anxiety about things like that."
good,"Was so excited to work for Wal Mart and was in a rather good Wal mart location. The problem is way to much stinking thinking, much of the stinking thinking was fruits of a ""Post Sam Walton Company"" is losing its way and loosing touch with ""real people in the store field"" that work extremely hard for the company but are undervalued and under appreciated. One said of company is shooting for employee retention with other side poorly designing ""necessary"" policies that are stressful to management and hourly workers,"
good,"Company was more employee oriented years ago. Now it it’s focus is more on getting job done with less help and higher expectations. I think employees and manger are great, I just don’t like the direction of the company."
good,It was the best work experience of my life but I am getting really burned out and need fresh pastures! Every year the company asks more of us and gives us less.  We have lost 30 employees since May of this year.  A mass exodus of disappointed employees who feel unappreciated.
good,Within the last several years of employment it was a fun place to work for but as the years went by management moral went down and seemed like they don’t care a whole lot about their employees just want a career change
good,If you don’t have a open availability you don’t get hours. Work every holiday. Weekends required. If part time mostly closing shifts. The only thing that is great about working here is you get to work with a lot of different people.
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart. I loved the work I did on the mod crew. I did,  however,  think that the expectations on the night crew was I unreasonable."
good,"It is very busy, be prepared to use problem solving, treat your customers with respect, and always be aware. Black Friday is actually fun to work but it is very hectic."
good,"Fast paced environment and pleasant people, would have stayed but I hate working all weekends and getting only weekdays off, you have to stay at least 90 days to qualify for any benefit"
good,"For some reason there is a bit of drama that goes around in the deli area of Walmart. The energy is usually good, it gets better towards the evening when everyone is more awake. Management definitely needs work and the hours have been very limited. Hardest part of the job so far for me has been getting my schedule correct. They are willing to work with you on building around personal events or schooling."
good,Since the family as taken over the business. It's all about profit. You may get 2  days per week.  Full-time worker hours are getting cut down to part-time there are taken away there benefits and all holiday s.
good,I enjoy working with people.  I  am outgoing person who loves helping people.  My issue was the unprofessional behavior of management.  I do not appreciate being cussed.
good,"Walmart as a whole is not a horrible company but certain positions I believe should get paid more than the wage that they are paid. Management plays favoritism, they also are very unprofessional, gossip, force their work onto associates. I wish I could've stayed but the way my life is set up. I need reliability."
good,It’s a great job other than the management. Everyone is kind of stressed out because of scheduling and poor hours. But other than that its not a bad place to work.
good,Loved my job and associates. Some members of management not helpful. Lots of room for advancement. Policies not clear. The overall mentality of management is everyone for themselves.
good,"My typical day was clocking in, reporting to my assign door whether it's grocery or general merchandise. I would begin all shopping carts with unbagged items with a scanning device or scan incoming items being returned."
good,"Walmart is a great job to have during school because of their flexible hours, but I would never consider it as a career. The management at this particular store is truly terrible and they do not care about the employees."
good,"Very fast paced work environment."
good,"If you want move up to a different position, The managers will try they best to keep you at the level you at even if you work hard. They only promote who they know are liked. Store #4526"
good,Management was terrible they would curse at you and talk bad to you in front of staff. The job itself is not bad. The customers are not that bad either.
good,"Very disorganized scheduling system, often messed up or just unfair.  You get pulled to different areas constantly because they never have enough help in any area. You have to be scheduled there for 9 hours in total as a full shift because they dont pay you for your hour lunch! Schedules vary a lot;  in the summer, full shifts usually range between...  7-4/8-5/9-6/10-7/11-8/12-9/1-10/ or 2-11.  In the winter, they can cut you back quite a bit, I have been given a 6pm-10pm shift several times, and have been cut back to as low as 26 hours a week even as a full time associate .....which also means they can drop your full time status if you dont work at least 32 per week for long enough!!!  99.9% of the time they absolutely do not allow you any overtime!  ...If you do go over, they make you get rid of it by taking longer lunches.  Also, they dont allow you any time off during any holidays!"
good,"Overall experience of working here went from exciting to extremely stressful. Management needs serious improvement. They don't provide the hours you desire due to Customer Demand policy. I don't recommend no one working here, find a better job!"
good,"I am a person who stocks and unloads trucks. We get paid only 11.00 an hour but people who stand at the front door to greet people get paid 13.00 an hour. "
good,"I work in the ACC area of the store, so change oil, filters, batteries,  tires.  I have learned that Walmart is good place to develop people skills, and work experience. Management tries to make the customers happy as well as we employee's.  We strive to make customers happy, do quality work, then we work on the high speed productivity.   The hardest part of the job is making sure our customers are happy, and making sure we explain to them any issues we may find with their vehicles.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the people I work with, they are my family."
good,"The management, especially the supervisors, at Walmart humboldt is amazing, and they do the absolute best job they can. Walmart as a company, has very high expectations and little realistic “testing” of how things should run. You are expected to do a certain amount of work in a certain amount of time which assumes you have no interruptions and everything runs smoothly. Employees are fairly treated, but management is  punished if employees don’t do their job."
good,productive workplace just don't like how some of the management staff does business. However I do appreciate them hiring me and providing me the opportunity to work for them because unlike like most companies they are far from discriminative. I always thank them for heling me find a job position that I can work with.
good,"not much to say  i just  greeted customers  and checked receipt on the customers way out to make sure people were not steeling  things."
good,I’ve learn a lot but the pay didn’t equal out of what they wanted to do. I started out as cashier then moved all around different departments. I had good and bad experience.
good,I was very fast paced most of the time after about 3 months I was team leader on grocery side making sure employees was not slacking or not doing their job.
good,I worked in the men's department and then transferred to Cashier position.  This enabled me to fully have knowledge of a cashier position and in a specific department where i can apply both of my work ethics.
good,I did not feel as though I was appreciated for all the work that I had done over 13 years with the company . Pay was minimal. There was no support from management.
good,I enjoyed working at walmart in the beginning. They soon began to go down hill with the different store mangers and the lack of leadership. It was unorganized and choatic.
good,It was fair. I would recommend it to anyone. But i wouldnt expect too much.  Just be prepared for anything.  But i did make a lot of friends working here and most of the people were really sweet
good,I feel as though Walmart puts out a great product at lowest prices.  Overall I feel the company could take better care of their employee needs. Cutting hours doesn't pay all the bills.
good,The Walmart corporation as a whole isn’t that bad. The pay is fair and the benefits are decent. With every job there will always be things that you don’t agree with. Things constantly change and you must adapt to them or you will struggle. There will always be ups and downs at every job.
good,"My work day would include stocking freight, zoning or front facing shelves, customer assistance, display set up/maintenance, customer courtesy assistance, maintenance, merchandise accounting, storage, unload trucks, Powered Lift Equipment use, pricing, cashier, assist management with other projects, assist in other departments around the store {as needed)."
good,During my time of working in the back room of the store the supervisors would yell at you if your too slow and tell you to stop slacking or your going to get coaches ( points ) and once you have 3-4 your fired. The employees would talk bad about their co-workers they would say anything to get the other person fired. They all don’t get along and just stay in their group and when we have to unload 2 big trucks in less than 2-3 hours because the supervisor said everything turns into  Chaos Chaos Chaos. Well good luck if your planning to work in the stock room of this Walmart
good,I mean it wasn’t my favorite job but it wasn’t the worst. They had okay management when I worked there but the management always denied days off even if you asked a month in advance.
good,"As a sales associate it was fast paced but not very stressful and easy to accomplish assignments.  Being promoted in less than 6 months with no training and during the holiday season made things very challenging.  I didn't get properly trained as a department manager until in the position 5 months.  The online training was decent, but poorly assigned for the job codes.  I learned more about the CAP process and the registers when taking CAP training that would have been very helpful as a sales associate and department manager...but it was too late."
good,Busy work day maybe asked to help out other areas from time to time. I they know you know more about another area they will use you to help out that area and there is no job comp. if there is a high pay for that area.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart and wish they would not have eliminated my position. I enjoyed working with others. I really can't say anything bad about the company.
good,"The company is a good company, but it very stressfull and does not really give you balance to have a personal life. Your on call giving long work days and no real gratitude for what you do."
good,"I was lucky enough to recieve my 40 hours but if I wanted to advance, I would never get a chance. There is lots of favortism. It does pay the bills if you get your hours."
good,Not much to say it was just a temporary job. Nothing really great about it. Not a career worthy job. Only a good job for younger people in high school.
good,Walmart is very fast paced. I work overnights right now which is the core of the store with figuring 9ut how to stock and clean up whole store. Tetris I call it.
good,"Overall Walmart does have many items to choose from. Unfortunately, many times they are out of specific brand names. It makes me wonder if they might be pushing their store brand. The employees are quite helpful and polite at my local store. I shop here at least weekly and can usually find exactly what I want. But I have noticed that Walmart quality and services seems to change from location to location. An example is the Walmart at Monroeville, Alabama location seems to have lesser quality clothing and less varieties of food. An example is trying to find a fresh corned beef. Virtually impossible! The friendliness and helpfulness of the employees here was much less than at my local store. This made me appreciate my store."
good,"Honestly, there is nothing wrong with it as far as mundane jobs with no potential go. If you pass the probation period, you'll be able to work there in your little blue vest until you die, or until you're dumb enough to steal something. The perfect job for people who just need an income until something better comes along.  Good luck out there, people."
good,"My pay, my hours, and my benefits were all satisfactory.Management was not. As employees, we were seen as components to be handled, not as partners in the process."
good,"The actual job requirements were acceptable, but the management made work unnecessarily difficult. Overall, I felt like the employees were considered expendable - they treated us like it was easier to hire new employees rather than treat current employees well enough to make them want to stay."
good,"I was hired as a cashier and was supposed to make 10 an hour. I only made 9 and then was given the run around about someone signing off on my computer training to get the raise. This was months of back and forth meanwhile new hires came in making more from the start. I worked full time hours but was listed as a part time employee so I never got benefits. When I got the flu and my son had the flu, I had to miss work and was let go despite having a Dr. note. Overall. The work was not bad, just didnt feel like most of management didnt see you as a person but as just a worker."
good,The job was good to work with. Nothing unusual besides managers not listening and wanting to write people up just because they are having bad days.  They cut your hours with out notice.
good,When I worked at Walmart stocked my area were ever it my be that day. When I would get to my area my pallets would already be there and I would down size them and then start with the most I had on one category stock that and then work my way down till I was done. Then take what was left to the back room to be put in the bins. After that I would pull the merchandise to the front of the shelf three forward  to make the shelf  look  full and then we would clock out and go home
good,"Management was over-worked and under paid. We were constantly picking up where after everyone. The store I was at was in some ways unique in that at some point it became a ""not my job, not my problem"" store. Other places I've worked people looked out for one another and helped each other. This store, if there was something as simple as a piece of cardboard on the floor anywhere, they would walk by it if they didn't let it fall there. I've never seen so much of this attitude anywhere. Also, associates taking their 15 min breaks...Any other place I've worked, yes, people took their breaks, but they only took them if they felt the need to. Otherwise they worked through their day only taking lunch. This store, people took their breaks like they were mandated by the President of the US."
good,Main thing is here no one gets along with each other all shifts blame one another and management does nothing to fix the issues. Also careful what you do here everybody's nose is in everyone else business
good,Good company but it changes a lot. They restructure management a lot lately and rolling out new programs more than ever. It seems they are using machines and robots to take jobs away from people.
good,Management is okay. You have some that don’t know what they are doing at all. Even after all the suppose to be training that they go through! They still are no good.
good,"With better management things could be a lot better. They could give us over time, but they won't. Great opportunity to move up in the business. Like I said the people over you have nasty attitudes. Not all Walmarts but mine specifically."
good,"Little to no benefits. The management constantly asked more from us while they did what I would argue, less than all of us. We basically made that store and rarely got attention for it, but for the job it is I guess it's worth $11.22 per hour."
good,Walmart is a great place for collage students but it just seems to me that it is hard to work your way up and and your job is never secure even if your management or and associate.But if your just looking a temporary job i would recommend it to anyone its not that hard of a job and it pays well.
good,"As a sales associate, this was the job I needed while finishing my last two years of college. The mission drives this company and it's a great mission. The execution of the mission is not so great. There were plenty of departs that was understaffed. This leads to those that do work being overworked and I'm not referring to extra hours. The smallest department should have at least 3 peopled staffed to run efficiently but often you will see only one associate staffed. This lowers the money Wal-Mart pays it's employees and allowing them to maintain lower prices for the consumer. The side of the transactions person falls on determines if this a good company or a ""meh"" company. My time here was not all bad. The people I worked with were awesome, including the ones that come from different stores to help out. The hard work from those many understaffed days instilled things in me that I still utilize today."
good,I've worked for Walmart about ten years in numerous positions. I started in the front end of the store and now in Auto department. I take a lot of knowledge from my years here.
good,I've been working there for quite some time and I wouldn't recommend for the professional man or woman to work there. If your looking for a quick buck yes I recommend Walmart
good,"Not a good place to work. Management doesn't like to help, or train you in the area you got hired for. They will put you in different areas and expect you to know it, and yell at you for not doing it. The only good thing is you can move up rather quick, beceause the turnover rate is high. Pay is also not very good."
good,"Na minha área antes era bom porém ,mudaram muitas coisas dificultando o trabalho;o RH n era bom tudo tinha q abrir chamado."
good,"The associates are great to work with but in my opinion some of the management could be better. Overall, I have enjoyed working there. I have learned a lot working at Walmart! I have always been a people person but Walmart has brought me so much closer to a lot of the customers. At the end of the day, I always want to impact someone else’s life && try my best to make them smile"
good,great benefits even for part time associates. great pay but the work load is ridiculous. the work atmosphere is 100% dependent on the management team and if they want to be difficult for no reason. every store is different regardless of the fact that they should all run the same and the store managers almost all have god complex because their name is printed on the receipt.
good,Pay was good but the supervisors were really rude and didn’t help when help was needed. They took their time coming to the register when they were called so costumers would be even more upset when they finally got there.
good,"I completed transactions for customers at the register and at the customer service desk. I improved in my customer service skills and interactions with fellow staff members. The high up managers were condescending and seemed to care less about the actual staff and more about themselves. They always had a terrible attitude with staff, but when in front of customers, they pretended to be perfect. The fellow staff, and CSM's were all personal and genuinely cared about each other."
good,"the work was stressful and not enough Cashiers on a busy day ( Friday, Saturday, and Sunday."
good,"While working there I met a lot of good people who were amazing to work with. Management has always been disconnected to the specific area I worked in. In the end I was given the opportunity to advance, but was told I would stay at the starting cashiering wage while entering management. If you want a good wage for a pretty standard job I would recommend, but if growth in the company is what you are looking for I would not recommend the specific store I worked in."
good,I worked with some wonderful people - and some not so wonderful.  Department was usually understaffed due to call offs.  I learned most areas of the deli and bakery and enjoyed it.
good,Walmart is a nice place to work to learn entry-level job skills and gain work experience. promotions can be gain but it helps to be pals with someone in management. Hours are decent. Management is subpar.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work , only thing is I wish I was full time or received more hours to support myself. It would of been a great job but , I have to find something better."
good,"They are willing to give anyone a chance, not many companies can say that. There is always a lot of room for advancement. Workplace culture is revolved around sales."
good,Just go to work don't make friends and the place will be great. Don't miss any work for ninety days until protected sick pay starts. Keep a open mind on learning new things and work with integrity and efficiency.
good,"Over the years, I have had many positive and a few negative experiences. I have had opportunity to work alone as well as part of a group, lead teams and train many people and aid in their growth and development. Learned many new skills and and grew significantly in my own skills as a manager and leader."
good,A empresa possui uma hierarquia muito extensa e burocrática.  As opiniões de  subordinados para melhorias  são geralmente ignoradas pelos superiores.
good,Had a good time serving/getting to know the clients who came to the pharmacy department. Never a quiet moment as there was always something to do such as stocking shelves and general tidying.
good,"Management is terrible, you go to them and they tell everyone. Then they still do nothing. You had to watch your back as everyone was out for themselves. They were always afraid of lawsuits from pregnant people."
good,"It was a decent place to work. However, management didn't have accurate communication which would lead to a failure on completion of tasks. Most annoying part is picking up others slack"
good,"Walmart was an interesting place to work. I am grateful for my experience there. My co-workers were an amazing team to work with, in both the bakery and deli."
good,The job was a nice job for the most part. It was a fast pace job. I think they need better managers who actually care about the team members. I think trying to move up in the company should be looked at as a unit.
good,I worked in CAP2 and it was a good job cause you're always moving and working fast but the management was horrible they'd yell at us to unload a  full truck in under 2 hours and they'd get frustrated if we weren't unloading fast enough making it unmotivating.
good,"Walmart was a good place to start out my work experience. It was fast pace, stayed busy, nice co workers and fair bosses. I learned how to work with a team. I enjoyed incentive bonuses and PTO. Overall a pretty good working environment."
good,My experience wasn’t that great to begin with I had a horrible  department  manager and was in rock and a hard place but it heads with her constantly my recommendation is you need to have a thick skin and a back up plan just in case things don’t work out sometimes that’s the case
good,"Overnights, putting things on shelves, or dealing with orders.  how to operate a couple machines that i haven't before.  Management was alright, not the best, but alright.  Fun, stressful, exhausting, and sometimes boring.  Having to deal with orders, or the delivery folks.  hanging with a guy that I became friends with, and getting to operate a stand up forklift."
good,"Never knew produce. I learned quickly and loved it. when I was in produce at frys I ended up with a ruptured hernia had emergency surgery and no longer could lift over 25 pounds, could not do produce any longer. Wal mart is a good stepping stone into retail enviroment. Do not have much else to say."
good,Long time employee working in various divisions and fields within the company.  Earlier days of career were much more satisfying. Constant change & downsizing has had a dramatic affect on belief in company by myself and peers.
good,I worked in the bakery and actually liked it quite well. I just didn't like being thrown around different shifts constantly. Many times you can ask to be trained in other areas but your voice is not really heard. You really are replaceable there so not causing issues is probably the best bet if you work there. Management is fairly lose and you can get away with slacking off as long as the department looks good at 7 am.
good,The job was ok. I didn't think they were always fair. If you were in the right click you were fine. I personally wasn't in a click. I went did my job and left
good,"unloading. Sorting  And stocking done done by cap team two "
good,"Benefits are good and pay is good,  it the amount of work they except from one person is a little much. Management doesn't communicate with each other or associates very well"
good,"Practice a lot of customer service, solve complains and learned about  retail world. Seasonal sells are a big team effort. They give you the option to work in different departments."
good,I greeted customers as they walk to me like Tronics I showed them the proper equipment to you probably never deleted any picture ration I collect the cash I gave the proper chain of you? I also have some laughs with the customers and also from argument hectic time of the year
good,This job is a job for teens fresh out of high school I dont know how people can make a career out of it and on top of having kids to the money is not there
good,When I first started at Walmart it seemed to be okay but then when working with my department manager things would be hard. the manger would put down me and other co-workers or tell us that anything bad that happened would be put on us. at times it was so stressful it was giving me health problems. I wouldn't recommend anyone work at Walmart unless you get a good manager
good,"Working at walmart can be challenging. There are not enough employees to perform the task which is need to run the store, there always short staff and the people that are there working are over worked with multiple task which are not realistic to complete in the time frame that is needed. Also when it comes to advancement or to step down, the management will not allow you due to the fact that if your an asset in one area they rather keep you there versus understanding your happiness of the work place. Walmart as a whole company is focus more on make the money versus actually customer and employee happiness. In my honest opinion, they have changed from what was originally wanted by the founder Sam Walton. Employees now are more unhappy and over worked and still not compensated as need be. Also the equipment that is needed to complete there task is also less, you can't do your job if you don't have the proper tools to do it."
good,"If you work smart, you'll strive here. Everything is on process so tasks are somewhat easy to do. Co-workers are friendly and try to help each other out even if they are from other departments."
good,"I would recommend new job classification.  I was trained as cashier but only performed this duty approximately 30 minutes a night.  I was to restock all returns from days left, restock items customers ditched on their way to check out.  Manager gave us only so much time in each department to pull inventory forward, organize, most of the store and was critical of me and one other employee if it wasn't done.  On days you can hardly make it 12 ft without a walmart stocker  or other employee's. My family was depending on me to pay rent, utilities, etc I pulled my lower back picking up air conditioner and restocking it.  I couldn't get out of bed next couple days and explained to manager.  They give 4 occurrences for missing on a holiday.  A normal call in sick day is one occurrence.  4 occurrences you are terminated.  I have seen holiday pay taken away, but not adding 3 call in occurrences to a day."
good,not a great place.. always had to work weekends and hours were all over the place. pay was low and just could not make enough money. Liked the job and meeting people.
good,Come to work on time and make sure you do your job correctly. Hardest part about the job is being inside of the freezer and having to be in that cold area for a long period of time.
good,"Work hours were good, but understaffing was rampant at the Walmart I worked at, and it shined especially bad between the 1st and 5th of the month every month. It's especially bad during the summer months where temperatures become borderline deadly, but the stockmen still gotta go out, bring in 150+ pounds of hot metal, which may or may not have wasps nesting inside the hollow parts of the carts, and do it quick so people can take more than they need, and we weren't allowed to take a break unless the indoor cart storage was full, and it only lasted about a minute before we had to go back out. And god help you if you're the only stockman on duty that day. Management was just kinda there, not really doing anything to help or hurt. All the coworkers were kind, except one other stockman, but he got fired, but it took entirely too long for that to happen. Most enjoyable parts of the job are when we got to slow down and talk to coworkers, cause if you aren't working, you could get penalized, which is dumb."
good,Walmart was an okay job. Just looking for more busy work. Looking for different opportunities. The job was a little too laid back. And I need to be busy while at work.
good,I worked overnights and it was ok. My manager wasn't the greatest. The coworkers were all great though. The expect you to do a million things at once.
good,"Great for long-term employment"
good,It's a good starter job but if you have any issue's with being told your not working hard enough and you need to do more than you can don't apply for the job
good,Overall Walmart in Wasco doesn't have good management. They have their favorite associated. They will treat you less if you make them look bad. Needs better Management. An should listen to their associate. Not judge..
good,"Before working at any Walmart location, visit it on various days and on a holiday weekend, if possible. Observe the customers and how they behave. You will be serving them. Observe the employees and their maturity. You will be working with them. Check if all departments are well-staffed and clean. Make sure you feel safe visiting there at night. If you absolutely love the store then apply. If you want to make a career of it then apply when you are twenty-five years of age or younger."
good,I loved my job just the pay wasn’t great it only got me by to pay bills nothing extra. Other than that and it was hard to move up in the company and had raised the job was okay nice environment to work and learn about people.
good,"Walmart gave me employment when I lost my career.  I was a cashier, worked in produce, and ended my career as a On-Line-Shopper.  We were able to buy insurance at a fare rate and our paid time off was generous.  In addition, we received a bonus every four months and a two dollar raise during peak season.  Yet, it was difficult to live on Hilton Head and pay my bills with the minimal pay."
good,"the job was okay in the begging but then I began to see the company flaws as the months went by. Like poor management, them just being very lazy or off putting and rude and intended to belittled you if you were not in their position"
good,"Its a great place to work. Easy and the pay is decent. I'm just looking for more excitement in my life. I pictured retiring at Walmart, but I don't see it anymore. I'm ready for something new in a new state."
good,The hardest part of the job at Walmart would be making sure the customer is satisfied. Some customers can be more difficult than others. You must strive to be your very best in the customer service world.
good,"I am a very hard worker. "
good,There are a couple good managers but the rest are only out for themselves. They do not take care of associates. Turnover is really high. Procedures change rapidly.
good,It has its ups and downs . I love working with my team and doing a long days of work. Although i do wish that Walmart did have a bit of better management. Because there are alot of errors that could be fixed.
good,It Could Be Little Bit Better But Overall It’s Working Out For Me . I’m Trying To Make It Work Until I Find Something Else Better . I’m Learning Service
good,I just stocked the shelves as quick as I can with the corresponding merchandise because I had to put out so much new supplies within a certain time all while helping my associates and being hassled by management about job production at the same time.
good,It’s an ok place to work for but if you are trying to advance then it’s not the company you want to do it for. So in all yes I would recommend it but also be ready for the headache
good,I learned a lot of customer service skills. I learned to be more patient due to very rude customers. Management is unprofessional at times. Communication within team needs to be worked on.
good,"It’s an ok job, but I wouldn’t consider as a career choice. The pay is not enough, especially if u have a family to raise. The hours is up n down. Sometimes u get 40hrs n then it’s drop down to 20-25 hrs a week."
good,its good if you are wana start your job experience but not in long terms
good,"Ambiente laboral agradable,los gerentes son pocos los que tienen calidad humana"
good,Walmart managing was not great not enough pay had workers in different positions wasnt 40 hours weekly they always rushing workers when they had only 2 people on the floor working
good,"Wal mart is an interesting place work, the associates are like "
good,"I would typically unload food and general merchandise from trucks then sort them out and deliver them to the floor of the store to be sorted and placed on the shelves. I learned how to use a pallet jack. Management was pretty cool honestly and pretty accommodate to me. The workplace culture was divided some people being friendly and some not so much. The hardest part of this job was the physical side of it, unloading trucks was not easy work by no means you're on your feet all day and the trucks were typically very hot or cold depending of the weather outside. The Most enjoyable part of this job was working with my coworkers in the back, I got along with a lot of them and still keep in touch with some today."
good,Walmart managers treat their employees like cattle. They got ways for you to save money like in the stock or through their Walmart money card app. It has its goods it has its bad too.
good,It’s has its ups and downs. Depending on Walmart wants to treat there employees honestly. I worked there for almost six years they don’t really care about if you if something happens on the job
good,"An overall good experience. I started in the garden center, and tried various other positions  with the company.I am currently  a Department Manager,and have learned a lot."
good,"Work there part time while I pursue a degree. Pay is pretty good for a part time job but definitely not somewhere to make a career out of it. Management likes to play favorites and do the bare minimum for the rest of associates. Scheduling by far is the worst issue there, they expect you to do the work of 3-4 people because they refuse to give people hours or flat out don’t hire. On top of that, your schedule can change at a moments notice with little regard to your outside life (school, babysitter, etc). The best part of the job would be the pay, customer service experience, and all the breaks you get in your shift."
good,"It's a good place to work. But the management is unprofessional, lack of communication. I know in the Walmart policy they say no favoritism is allowed & yes there is favoritism in the workplace to a certain extent. But it like I said it's a good job it just has its ups and downs. If I had a chance I would work for Walmart again."
good,"Various management types.  Work schedule sucks.  Favoritism among employees was present.  No one wanted to work weekends, and favoritism was even more present."
good,"A typical day could mean ringing customers out at the register, answering questions for customers, helping customers find items, activating a new cell phone, and stocking shelves. There are chances to move up in the company but it can be very difficult. Sometimes the hardest part of the job can be getting things done that management wants done and helping customers. It's possible but hard. The most enjoyable part are the customers and co workers, learning new things and showing new hires what to do."
good,Some days were easy but most had the managment pushing unrealistic tasks and punishing us for not meeting impossible goals. Some of the management was alright but several were confused and contradictory.
good,No comment can’t say much about it.. management sucks.. good fellows associates.. but really bad management.. wouldn’t like to work there anymore.. thank you
good,I love my customer at walmart they are the best of all thing at walmart! When i see them they light up my day. My 15 +years has been good and bad. But I thank God for it.  The hardest part is not having the help you need to do your job. Any day at walmart is hard . I learn a lots from all the years i been there.
good,"Learned how to multitask very well with little staff and being extremely busy at high traffic hours."
good,"the store I worked for had unreasonable expectations, and the management treated you more on the grounds of how well they liked you, not how hard you worked."
good,An eventful job that once there you will never forget the experiences nor will you forget the management and the type of training that comes with being a Walmart employee
good,With all of the changes the company is making it is becoming more difficult to reach my daily goals.  Teamwork is severely lacking and no one has time to care.
good,They cut my hours for no reason when I was the 4th longest dispenser there. It seems as management has their favorites and will do anything for them. Everyone always seems to be on edge.
good,"Other than the horrible management and employees with no intent to work it wasn't that bad of a place I always came in did what I was suppose to do and left, there were several times I was interviewed for a higher position but was passed up by people with less experience"
good,Some days were great and easy but most days were a nightmare! Customers are horrible to you even if they just walked in the door. The people you work with can be ok. Management is terrible in my opinion and there is never enough people staffed NEVER
good,On some days the workplace is great but somedays it's not very good. Sometimes as a service tech we would have to take on another job of writing up orders because there would be no service writer scheduled.
good,Working at Walmart was great because I could basically do anything I wanted to. Only rules that was enforced is not being late to work and taking a break before your 6 hour mark.
good,"As a cake decorator, one would begin the  morning with the first order of the day and work their way down the orders while also taking new orders and continuously stocking the cake case.  This taught me valuable time-management skills that I have applied in other areas of life."
good,"Decent place to work but management is disorganized at best. Communication requires work, but hours are consistent. Can work as a team to get jobs done."
good,Decent job if it's your only job. But if you're a full time student only wanting to work part time - this isn't the place to go. I was hired on with the promise of only have 20 hrs per week - I ended up working 36-38 hrs each week.
good,"It was an interesting job opportunity, I believe each job has something to teach you, however, Walmart specialty pharmacy has a wonderful idea that is poorly executed but some how works if that make sense. You don't have the autonomy that you need at times which makes it frustrating as you can't help the patient as much as you would like to."
good,"The workplace itself was okay, in my opinion the management was not the best, responsibilities were simple and easy to understand. Overall a good job but could definitely have been better."
good,It's pretty easy to get a job here. Although management is not the best and corporate strategy isn't up to par there are some benefits to working for this company.
good,"Everything about the job was great, except the management was judging by groups rather than how you performed at work. If you can deal with people than it'll be a good job."
good,The hardest part of my job was learning the store. Figuring out where everything is is a tricky thing with all the stuff. I like to stock though. I would say stocking has grown on me.
good,It’s a alright job if u need money to bring in fast. Customer can get annoying it want to argue but u just call a manager n they handle it.they give u two 15min and a 30min or a hour lunch. Depends on ur hours u worked.
good,"Le salaire n’est pas du tout compétitif, salaire minimum et augmentation de 0.30$ par année jusqu’à un maximum de 16$/h. On abuse de toi quand ils ont besoin de toi, possibilité de faire plus de 40h par semaine dans ces cas là, puis de tomber à 12h par semaine lorsqu’ils n’ont plus besoin de toi. Idéal pour les jeunes étudiants qui n’ont rien à payer, sinon tu risques d’être serré dans ton budget à 12,65$/h et 12h par semaine. À part cela, lorsqu’un poste est affiché, c’est seulement pour respecter la procédure, mais le poste est déjà attribué d’avance. Sinon, si tu ne veux pas beaucoup d’heures, ils sont flexibles là-dessus."
good,Not many workers. Some of the management didn't cooperate well. Team members worked well with each other. Big bosses really cared for your health and overall being. They sometimes gave us free food. Holidays are the fun parts.
good,Watch what you say around certain people here. Just do your job and go home. Don't wear your uniform home if you forget it you will be changed a new one. If you loose your badge your charged a new one and get points deducted.
good,The work at wal mart was very easy but the lack of hours that were being offered was a real downfall to the job. the management was not terrible but the opportunity to move from an hourly associate to a salary associate was not present.
good,"No two days was the same at walmart, I learn to work in a fast pace. the hardest part of the job was helping a lot of people at once but once you get pass that than the job was amazing,"
good,"Making people happy, saving money so they can live better is what it is all about. That is what Sam Walton wanted us to do.  Customers 1st. "
good,I work at a neighborhood market. Its always busy. I started working as a overnight stocker but then Walmart wanted to change to evening stocking. So we have a morning team that is supposed to finish what the evening team doesn't finish and during down top stock. The amount of work they want us to finish is overwhelming and for only $11. It's not worth it.
good,This was my first job I learn how to handle money and how to work with other people and how to handle customers when they were upset. This was a good place to start off with work experience.
good,"My experience at the particular Walmart I was hired with was a bad one. When we first started setting up the new store it was a positive experience. Everyone got alone great, plus we all pull our work tasks together with no problem. But after about two months after grand opening a lot of problems  came. A lot of the managers and co managers was violating Walmart's policy, it made it hard for me to to feel comfortable with trusting my store manager because she allowed some of the things to happen. Some of the pro's with the company is that you can grow, and they pay for your schooling to become more advanced in your career with them. plus the benefits are great. Also there's a 401K...."
good,Walmart reminded me of being back in high school. It was very cliquey and didn't really seem to care about the employees families around the holidays. It felt to me that Walmart cared more about making money.
good,"There is always a Walmart down the street. So you can always be close to home and your kids."
good,It's Walmart. They honestly do not care about you and will replace you in a heartbeat. They will not allow you to keep any overtime outside of the Thanksgiving/Christmas/new years holiday season. they pay 11 dollars minimum which is great but again its Walmart. Not the best place to work.
good,"Be on time, take ownership for self, show up to work ready and willing. Be ready for fast paced work, and a diverse work experience. Smile and be happy."
good,The typical day was stressful and I could not wait until the end of my shift. My managers had unrealistic expectations. I usually worked alone which made my job more demanding of me physically. The hardest part of the job was  trying to push large amounts of shopping carts in the store with out a cart pushing machine. The most enjoyable part was the discounts provided.
good,It was an okay workplace but the management at the time was not good to their employees. There were short breaks and most of the time they didn't care if you has already finished your shift and would try to keep you there longer.
good,all the cashiers work together as a team helping each other out when needed also the supervisors do pitch in to help if a cashier seems to be overwhelmed
good,"The back room is too demanding for the pay, garden center and cart pushing is too hot for florida, lack of breaks for cart pushers. Managers are always stressed out and it trickles to the lower level employees."
good,I'd prefer to discuss this on a 1-on-1 only. I'm not at liberty to discuss much of what occurred at my previous employment.  I'd be able to say more privately.
good,The job is not that bad but it is the managers who ruin the job for a lot of people. They make a lot of broken promises and cannot fulfill what is asked of them.
good,"It was an ok place to work and was actually fun sometimes, but most of the time the scheduling was so bad that we were understaffed. everyone was usually in a panic and because of the restructure no one knew who the manager was"
good,Management makes or breaks this place. It was rumored and known management was nicely flirtatious with our mainly female staff and took out their aggressions on males and females who were no subordinated. Even the store manager had no real understanding of every department but the back end. I was not given tools to succeed and was often blamed for things gone wrong even though I worked even off clock to right the wrongs. I hated the management.
good,When I worked at Walmart the management needed a lot of work. If they didn’t like you they’d cut your hours super bad or make you go sit in the computer in the back taking test that were not necessary.
good,"I did enjoy the workplace culture, interacting and helping customers was a fun part of the job. On the other hand a lot of times we are really understaffed and the wages could be better"
good,"depending on your hours your alone for3 hr. no help if someone calles in. superivors, managers and assocates have attitudes. has point syetem where u get 5 points if u call in its a point. if your late , clock in ealry, or leave early you get half a point . if you get 5 points you get terminated."
good,My fellow coworkers were great! It's just at the time I was only supposed to be hired as part time due to transportation issues and I was getting 40+ hours per week!
good,"Good place to work starting out. I still talk to a few friends that are there but I couldn't tell you personally if I would make a career of it. The thing that got them in trouble is accurate. You work 44 hours for 5 days of work with a one hour lunch break every day, you're required to clock out for that hour so when the time adds up, you work 39 hours and you're cut short of a full-time position and the benefits and possibly overtime. "
good,Like any place you have good workers and not so good ones.  To me it's a job. They have many departments to choose from.  Just make sure you tell them what you are looking for
good,"Pay was alright for someone who was coming out of high school or during, you'd get raises, but by the time you got that, you could be getting alot more at another job. However, the job was not hard, and wasn't absolute terrible, but the managers i felt did not do their job and would blatantly put blame onto others to save their own skin. They'd use you unfairly after being totally loyal to them."
good,Absolutely horrible around any big holidays. Outside of holidays Still a little stressful especially if any departments have more than one call out in a day.
good,Each night was calm and pleasant.  Learned how to work with tremendous amounts of currency in short amount of time.  Company well diversified. Enjoyed working with the public.
good,"They have drastically reduced hours, yet have you there more often. When I originally started i worked 4 days a week,8 hour shifts totaling a minimum of 32 hours. Now we work 5 days and sometimes get 32 hours only working 5 or 6 hour shifts. We also have a skeleton of a crew with no room for any call outs or vacation so everyone runs them self sick.  its just a repetitive work that they don't appreciate."
good,I liked it but hated management  very much they did not accommodate for my health therefore it was hard to work there and the pay sucked never got raised
good,"At my location, the management was not the best. "
good,"Walmart was a great company at one point in time. Walmart no longer adopts the culture of putting their people first. If you’re wanting a solid work home life balance, don’t become a manager at Walmart."
good,"It’s fun when u work with the right people, it easy to get the job done if I are willing to put the work and time in. It a pretty easy job as long as u stay focused on ur task"
good,"Typical Job recommended only to students. A typical day when giving work hours starts out well most of the customers are friendly, these are the ones who make the job worth being there, to go out of your way to help someone is just a good act of kindness."
good,"I enjoy the job a lot, but when corporate won’t cooperate with you, that’s what makes the job horrible. You have to keep harassing them to get anything at all done"
good,"An overall good starting job, but it is a ""who you know"" company for the most part. They do not really care about the wellness of the employees. Would rather have them work then be healthy. Not a good environment to receive advice from upper management about personal things."
good,"Always understaffed"
good,"Worked there twice and both times it did not click for me. The management were not all that friendly and flexible. The pay was not worth the stress, the other associates did not seem to be friendly it almost felt like i was working by myself."
good,"I liked working at Walmart for the most part. The new management came in and messed with my healthy workplace environment, but that wasn't why I resigned. The overall environment for a decent paying job was doable."
good,"Pay was okay, management was a pain. I loved the hours but they wanted you to constantly come in on days off. Don’t get me wrong I’m all for the extra cash but I need at least a day off a week."
good,"A lot of people complain about working at Walmart. It's really not a bad place, but you can't be lazy. With that being said a lot of times the company asks too much of its employees."
good,"Walmart is a nice place to work if you are young starting a career. I worked at the local D.C. and took the job in hopes of getting advancement. I hold two degrees and thought Walmart would be a great place for me to get into management. I actually made this known to my managers since the environment is suppose to support those who wish to move up. In turn I believe that making my intentions known was more detrimental than help. Walmart is a hughe corporation and everything is a numbers game....if you do not meet your numbers even when the situation is out of your control, you are responsible. Walmart has a good set up and intentions towards employees....but the number game creates a stressful atmosphere for management and employees"
good,"Greetings to customers , flexibility and working with others. Satisfying customers needs. Being on time. Flexibility work hours. Most of all complete all assignments."
good,"there is a good reason why their turnover is more than 300%, it's not a job for just anyone, it takes a special breed of consciousness to work there. "
good,This company requires to learn multiple departments other than you main focus. The hours can be difficult at times because they can schedule you to close at 12am and open the next day at 6am.
good,"Walmart was great just the position I had was not gettting paid enough for what we were doing , but overall it  was a good job just management wasn’t good"
good,"Management was your most concerned, there was a lack of communication and you never could find them when you needed them. Only thing that was good was your coworkers they became your family and you experience the ups and downs along with them."
good,It can be hard on you and your back to stand in one spot for hours at a time. you cant move to another dept to work for 6 months and your hours very each week. Cashiers use each others tills.I work every weekend day to night and off week days in less I ask off.Iwould not work as mgr here.
good,"If you have never worked at Walmart, then give it a shot."
good,Working at Walmart helped me develop a great work ethic. Walmart gave me a daily challenge that left me exhausted but feeling accomplished. The time I spent at Walmart allowed me to work and earn the things I desired with plenty of overtime so for anyone wanting to really work this place is perfect for them.
good,"Walmart is an alright workplace, it pays decently for minimum wage, and the work isn't too stressful. If you need something basic this is where it is."
good,Horrrible place to work. Management is misguided on every level. People who work are punished for doing so by picking up everyone else work. Management likes to pick favorites and bend the rules for them when needed.
good,"I was harrassed by almost all my managers there. Would not reccomend working at this terrible establishment. Good pay, but the management sucked, and they just switched the work up so now you're just doing busy work."
good,"They get there moneys worth out of most their associates, that's for sure! High turnover means lots of new and untrained people leaving the burden on those with experience. High expectations and demand"
good,Walmart is a very cheap company to be such a large business. I wouldn’t recommend working here if you have bills because the hours are horrible that are given & the occurrence system sucks as well!
good,"Walmart is a fun place to work if you have the right environment. It is an easy going and laid back work place. Casual dressing (Excluding leggings, even under a skirt or dress) close toed shoes with a heel covering and soles are required."
good,Had days when there was barely any staff on the sales floor(either in a mandatory meeting or just not scheduled).  There would be only a couple of cashiers to handle the customers and the requests for additional assistance was not heeded
good,Its a good place to work for high school or college student. Not for graduated students because walmart do not have job opportunities  for advancement if you have a degree
good,"I can't speak for every employee at Walmart, especially those at different stores, but I would in depth mingle and ask every employee I met how they felt about their job and if they were compensated fairly. And their answers for the most part were pretty consistent, there were a few stray opinions but most people I talked to pretty much agreed. However I do not have the perspectives of any managers above department and Customer service managers. So this would be a view of  Walmart from the cashier at one of the super stores, a guy bottom of the barrel if you will. Walmart is all about cutting costs in every way possible. Whether it be using less paper towels to clean up a mess, cutting hours a bit for not meeting minimum profit expectancy, but a certain level of quality is also cut. Don't get me wrong most employees are not willing to cut corners but when you try to cut costs a certain quality becomes obviously missing. Though nothing that would impact that Walmart customers. Most customers don't even notice it. I didn't even notice it until I was an employee. I'm not saying this is bad. Obviously this system has worked, Walmart is one of the biggest companies in the entire world. And of course every big company has i ts dark secrets and will do something dodgy every now and again. Not any one method Walmart does is bad. Looking at them by themselves in a vacuum makes it hard to even complain really. But everything building on top of each other as far as I can tell, most employees feel unsatisfied. It can be difficult to say we are under compensated especially being well above"
good,i did not work long enough to establish an appropriate summary. the hours were not spread evenly amongst the workers and pay was insufficient for at the cost of living
good,If you can deal with rude incompetent customers all day then you have the number one skill of a Walmart cashier. The rest is just cash handling and learning about food stamps.
good,A normal day at work is productive but sometimes management can be very asking of you to go over and beyond it's challenging but I never quit do my best
good,"The area I work in is not bad, but with what corporate keeps stacking on top of our already full work load makes the job now stressful and somewhat depressing."
good,"I love working there the first couple months. When I was a cashier, alot of people complained about the self checkouts and focused there complaints toward the Associates. Then I was offered produce job. It was really good the first month but I quickly realized it was way to much for just a couple of people."
good,"The managers I worked with were awesome, the hours I worked were perfect for me and they worked with me for a schedule on days I worked. The job it self was easy to do I never had to much on my plate to handle and if I did need help with anything it did take asking multiple times for the answer I was looking for."
good,"Walmart isnt that bad, i enjoyed being on the floor and helping customers out, ive had plenty want me to go home with them and do home installation but thats a big no"
good,"everyday at work was a relaxing slow-paced type ( at least to me )"
good,"Lo mejor es el trato con los compañeros, donde te ayudan a hacer correctamente tu trabajo"
good,"typical day at Walmart consist of counting pills entering prescription cleaning work area checking in inventory checking out customers, shocking shelves"
good,Great company to work for but the management needs reconfiguring because some individuals are stuck in past organizational and management procedures which do not work.
good,Everyone starts a typical work day by clocking in and reporting to your departments supervisor and that is the best thing to happen all day. Supervisors are the management basic employees see and upper management only ever talks to you through them or if something bad happens to you personally. Most people can agree that managers are not suppose to be your best friends but it a good manager needs to interact with their employees positively to build moral and keep turnover rates down. Supervisors have this skill down but upper management does not even try to interact positively with anyone.
good,"Management conflicts on everything. If you are not a member of management, you are worthless. The harder you work, the more that is asked of you, but the people that do nothing are ignored. I had to quit after having a mental breakdown."
good,A good place to work if you invest in stock.  Must work in multiple sections of the store.  getting a raise is not common.  after the first 6 months you get a small raise if you are a good employee.  Most employee's are not satisfied with their salary or hourly pay.
good,This is a good place for first time workers and elderly and is ok for a temporary situation. Management is good but some are horrible and disrespectful.  Some managers treat workers like children. No set work shift unless on over night crew.
good,No home life.  Demand for hours worked too much.  Worked more days off than able to take off.  Worked extra hours on a daily basis.  Benefits were good.
good,"Overall the job was not bad, it was stressful at times and boring at others, but at the end of the day my fellow coworkers made it enjoyable. I would go back only for that, the ease of access to food on lunch breaks was nice, and the occasional free food they offered the staff."
good,"It was a just a okay job. Had I had proper management I would have done better and stayed longer. I was also young, and didnt have the know how, to stand up for myself....as apposed to now, years later."
good,It was a fun place to work.  There was a lot of work to do in 8 hours.  There was no time to goof off.  Christmas time was really busy and there were times you did not get your last break in.
good,"A normal day,you do your job the best you can and you leave."
good,Not worth the time unless you are salary. Now that the management is being deemed unnecessary by the corporate offices in Bentonville Arkansas roles are shifting and people are being let go left and right
good,Love the customer interaction. Management is spread thin in some areas. Benefits are okay however if you have a family benefits are not very helpful due to high deductibles.
good,"a typical day at work was stressful and rewarding"
good,"I work on the hardest shift at my DC exceeding management expectations, and while expectations are met every week it is never good enough. Not to mention clocking out for lunch and not reaching 40 hrs per week. Did I fail to mention the salary cap after 2 years of being with the company?"
good,It's all about making money  walmart no longer cares about the family and life balance. They claim they do however if your life doesn't fit the plan your out. Either you get less hours so you struggling to pay bills or you leave looking for better stability
good,"But that's about where it ends. After that it's a roll of the dice with who you work with and for. I had 6 bosses in 3.5 years with the company and none of them had the same or even similar interpretations of company policy or federal, state, and local laws. Change is important and is needed in a company but drastic changes every 6 months made my team's and my head spin."
good,"The Waltons make too much money to not care for associates a lot better.. I've worked at a store that made over millions in a racist state in a day and lets just say.. Managment could do better without stealing also and actually doing their job and not focusing on bonuses and money. Customers would be alot happier. Overall, a pay raise isn't anything without granting associates with more hours and better compassion to the elder associates who've worked 15+ years."
good,"Although you had a designated area here, you have to know the entire store. Not necessarily isle number but at least departments. I was an apparel associate and I put away returns, fold clothes, and helped get people in fittings rooms."
good,As a cashier i had to scan items and handle money. I was also responsible for bagging customers belongings. During the first two weeks you have to do all this computer online work which is very tedious.
good,When you start out your just low man most management dont care about you only a few. The harder you work the more they want from you while others fp nothing. Some good brnefits but insurance is a disgrace
good,i started in the toy department and after graduation i went to the pharmacy. i was moved from the covington store to the ripley store and liked my job
good,"If you work the overnight shift, there is always more work to do than time allowed and people to do the work.  Management always pulls you away from projects and you feel like you don't accomplish anything.  On the modular overnight team, they are expecting you to do the modular resets in half the time allowed and will be coached for not getting them accomplished."
good,"A typical day involves me and up to 2 other guys helping me with operations before one of them leaves cause they're shift ended leaving two people to do the job of 3."
good,"The staff was great including management. My only issues were the lack of hours I was able to work which made it difficult to support myself financially and the lack of support from other team members when it was time to complete a task. Other than that, I have no complaints."
good,enjoyed this work place mainly because of the location and the customers that came in. Didn't really like the management and the other associates. Very problematic.
good,"My first few months working there we had already had two store managers, we were actually short staffed most of the time which caused a lot of stress on the department. People rush to take breaks often skip you & wont let you take yours. It’s a very high school environment with this one talking about that one. Some workers slack on purpose to avoid doing their jobs. I was fired for missing days when I put in for a transfer months before I actually moved & was supposed to be on a leave of absence for a immediate family illness. Never put it in that I needed a transfer from the store manager nor did they set up the leave of absence. It’s like pulling teeth to get help from anyone higher up. Pay was okay, not sure how raises work. The overall environment outside of the department with the workers is nice, very friendly associates for the most part. If you’re hard working & willing to WORK for your money, Walmart deli is the place for you."
good,I worked here for two years. I learned to decorate cakes as I did the job here. I enjoyed my actual job as a decorator. It was stressful because they didn’t hire another person to help for over a year. They only let me be a part time person which was also hard on me to perform the way I needed. Management didn’t know how to communicate at all. When they did hire someone else to help me it all of a sudden felt like everyone made me feel like I didn’t know how to do my job anymore .
good,"pace can vary day to day"
good,"Start your day planning how it will go then try to make it happen."
good,Not a terrible job. Only so many points for absence. Bonuses every 3 months. And then you get the 10% employee discount and then if you work Thanksgiving you get an additional discount for working that day you get a one-time discount on a purchase.
good,Working here I have learned that sometimes things are better looking from the outside looking in. I have experienced good things and bad things working here.
good,It was really enjoyable to work at first i had friends that liked to push eachother they all moved to go to college. So i was on my own and i would do as best as i could to finish my work for the night alot of the times it would get done there was one time were i was not able to finish it by myself so i asked for help when someone finished there area. They helped we got it done. But garden center got really hectic and it would be flooded with pallets to stock for the night that would overwhelm me thinking i wouldnt finish it. And alot of employees there would be very to them selves amd be rude if they didnt know you or like you. So overall this job made me learn from it but it wasnt the job for me.
good,The job it self was ok the coworkers were nice and super friendly just wasn’t enough pay but it was over all a good experience and a great job to start off with if your barely getting into finding a job
good,No job is perfect so honestly i knew there would be some pull backs.  Mainly it was my supervisor. She was ok but never have requested days off and was always complaining you had too much overtime while leaving you stranded on a register. But i heard once she left things got better so honestly i think this would be a great place to start your working experience
good,I had a great time working at Wal-Mart although they try to take advantage of hard workers. Unfairness. No appreciation besides thank you. They take us away from our job to do others jobs then get disappointed when we dont finish our job
good,Poor management. Supervisor corrected/belittled employees in front of customers and other fellow workers. But got praise front store manager on how will of a job i preformed.
good,Starting out here it was a fun place. Great for first time job. As a seasoned employee it can be tough to deal with turnover and others lack of care for work place standards.
good,walmart is very stressful it has good pay but its fast going an you have to try your best.its very busy and you have to move around alot and your on youre feet all day you have 2 15 min breaks an a hour and half for lunch.
good,It's fine for a while but it's definitely very stressful and extremely fast pace. Management is pretty poor and there's a general disinterest in their employees. You make decent pay and there are plenty of benefits but based on the mental and physical strain I wouldn't recommend it.
good,Walmart is an good company to work for in terms of schedule flexibility  and benefits. Under the right management can be a productive and relax environment to work.
good,"Was much better before July 2018. They dont listen to associates anymore.No extras for associates and the new attendance policy is awful. If you get sick , you risk losing your job."
good,Be careful with Walmart layoffs. It is like they pick names out of a hat. advancement is hard if you just do your job and do not get to know the correct people
good,not bad hours kinda sucked and the pay was pretty bad but normally the work days went by pretty fast and the people can be cool sometimes but the managers can get annoying
good,I have enjoyed working at this job for almost three years now but I’m looking for something that’ll continue to help me grow and improve my working skills. I appreciate everything this job had to offer me but I’m looking for something else that would better suit my life.
good,Daily job routine is Inventory management make sure shelves are replenished bring in vendors with their products make sure they're up to quantity and quality pricing
good,"Have a positive attitude. I think that's all that's really important. And make sure you're alright with driving the distance that you must, though I guess it's that way with anywhere."
good,"Walmart is an okay first job. However, it really depends what location you work at, or if your managers are cool or not. In the time that i have been there, upper management has gotten more strict overall, and has added pressure to the individual stores.  Also, they have wiped out many people's anual rases if the company decides to raise their minumum hourly rate. Have a goal to get out of Walmart before working there."
good,"As a cashier it was an easy job and not really demanding, but after awhile it becomes very cumbersome and boring. I was happy that the hiring process wasn't too long or hard and they provided good training."
good,Lawn and garden associate hqs ro work a fast paced has to Water plants. Had to clean my register the floor organize the racks the plants outside and take register box to manger with the money before closing doors at 9.
good,"I drive onto the lot and park. I go to the break room and buy a coffee from the vending machine. I clock in. I go to the front of the store and then look at the parking lot. I go to the side needing the most attention. I line up the whole parking lot. I grab the machine and collect it. every few hours I take a break(15 min, lunch, 15min). I clock out and go home. It is always hot so I have to drink a lot of water so I don't dehydrate. Management doesn't check on me too often unless the carts get low. I never let it get empty. I don't learn anything much anymore I am just a well oiled machine. I do my routine every work day praying for the sun to go away. Night time I do my best work since I am not as hot. Only problem is the humidity never goes away for long. I have difficulty understanding my fellow workers cause of strong accents. Hardest part of the job is the weekend to many people, with little to no help till 2pm. Most enjoyable part of the job is the sun sets. they are beautiful sometimes. Also the breezes when they are cool, not hot."
good,"Work is not complicated in and of itself, however an abundance of low-level and middle management as well as a lack of communication make it difficult to work efficiently. Furthermore, management blames its own poor decisions on its employees and subsequently effectively ostracizes otherwise competent people, as well as establishing a combative relationship between themselves and the workers at large."
good,not bad. management can be better. night shifts are boring and support managers do not do anything except using their phones. they are partial to some associates working at this location.
good,"i had to handle 4 positions at the same time because lack of associates for few weeks, to the point where i couldn't handle it, but it was nice working with the managers"
good,"muita gente"
good,It has gotten to the point where the only thing I like about my job is the hours I don’t like coming in anymore. This location is very unorganized currently looking for another job at the moment. I’m tired of being blamed because work isn’t getting done & I'm tired of my availability changing because of THEIR needs. Also higher ups in this location have nasty attitude and show favoritism most of the time they bring their problems to work and it makes me uncomfortable when I’m trying to do my job and they are being rude to me.
good,Majority of managers do not care about their employees. But pay is better than most. Very politically correct ( can be good or bad). Decent benefits here.
good,"Na empresa Wal-mart Brasil,foi aonde tudo começou..."
good,"When OGP got a new manager, she turned the whole place into an extremely stressful work environment. Our pickup lot only has space for six cars and half the time we had just about double that. She would hire about ten new people but none of them worked the shift that we needed (closing). she also hired her best friend and promised her a management position just after two weeks of working there (Walmart policy says you need to work for at least 6 months before stepping up) and even with that it was a problem because it was a conflict of interest; of course she would have a bias towards hiring her best friend so they could work together. When she was gone, she would leave her best friend in charge and we would be late on every pick and customers would be angry and she would just leave at her scheduled time, leaving the entire mess to be picked up by the minors with no department manager, sometimes leaving up to two hours after scheduled time and being called “lazy and just not wanting to do the job” the next day if we left hours after we were supposed to and not having finished. We would have to call for help from other departments because two people (us closers) can’t handle several hundred late picks and multiple customers outside complaining about the long wait.  She also had absolutely little to no respect for minors. Walmart policy is to give minors in high school their school activity days off, she would reject half of them because she wouldn’t have someone to close that day (I wonder why). She had even rejected our graduation days because “[she’s] trying to run a business"
good,As long as you have decent managers you will enjoy your job. Job can be demanding at times and they tend to put more on your plate than you can handle in one shift.
good,training was sometimes inconsistent.  job could be stressful.  holidays were always busy.  management was inconsistent from one to the other.  breaks were too short.
good,"the Walmart in Appleton, Wisconsin has horrible night management, I attempted to use an old manager for a reference and he never even responded after he said he would. Also the hours given were not enough for a ""living wage."""
good,you worked like a slave some management were very disrespectful they complained about everything even when you did right under staffed and they still wanted you to finish your task
good,The job is decent. Some of the managers are rude and don’t really care about the associates. The hours go up and down. They are not consistent at all.
good,"I mean you can for sure make some money for your extra bills, but depending on what you want as a career this may be a good fit for someone. "
good,"Working at Walmart was discouraging with no raises. When I received full time work in department cap 1,it was over loading for 1 work day. I would suggest a slower paced position.."
good,"You have good benefits and good pay but really poor shift hours,like 16 per  week. Management is also poor,shifts are different every week and mostly weekends"
good,Lack of respect poor management way to many managers department managers CSM. good co workers but immature managersdid not have tools or supply available to do work properly
good,"This used to be a great place to work.  Things are changing, though:  Responsibilities that once belonged to assistant managers now belong to department supervisors, with little to no compensation."
good,Being at walmart for 10 years I have seen the company go through many changes. All these changes have taken my view of the company in a downward direction. I'm sure it can be a good place for some to work at but they no longer fit me.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of getting a till for the register and provide great customer service and be the best and productive cashier I could."
good,Loved most of the people and management at the store that I worked for but the compensation did not pay enough hourly when I broke it down based on the hours that I was working and did not allow me to have a good work / life balance.
good,"I'm pregnant and high risk & got treated really bad. They did not accommodate me so I could keep my job."
good,I worked for Walmart for almost 2 years and now that I'm thinking about it was a good place to work for because the people you work with become just like your family. I was lucky enough to be placed in the electronics section or as a personal shopper.
good,Super stressful and coworkers wont let you just do your work in peace. The managers are almost too nice to the point that you feel like you cant say anything is wrong with the company directly to them.
good,"In the beginning of when I started working here it was awesome, friendly, and some associates treated you like family. Learned a lot of customer service. The main thing is that when you are working in this place to need to not have a short fuse. There will be horrible customer, and there will be horrible managers.The pay is really fair, but it is not worth it if its gonna make you hit into depression. "
good,"Never a dull moment, always moving. Expected to do your job duties as well as everyone else's. Strict staffing and budget constraints. Schedule always changing, No work life balance."
good,"Training is hit or miss, management is inconsistent with enforcement of rules and correct practices leading to extra work for those who do abide by the rules, tools often don't work and are antiquated, working conditions are cramped, jackets, gloves and hats are not provided for working in coolers for long stretches of time, management/supervisors are seldom seen and don't do their job. Morale is low and grumbling is rampant."
good,It’s a good job to start with but I don’t see it lasting forever. I consider it more of a temporary job then a full career also their are way too many people telling you what to do.
good,"Not a bad place to work ,but not really organized either. The hours are not stable unless you are a manager. The policies and expectations change constantly. The pay is decent."
good,The pay is very good. This is for the Wal Mart Return Center. It;s a warehouse and it's not climate controlled. It gets hot in there but they do have fans to circulate air. It's 10 hour shifts during the week with 2 breaks and NO lunch. The weekend shift is 12 hours.
good,"you are offered many hours at one the top paying retail jobs. You also get discounts on products such as food, clothing, and house products, etc. The work environment can be unpleasant at times."
good,"Great associates and customers"
good,You could get micromanaged by someone that was in the same position as you. Customers made it worth coming into work everyday just to have the opportunity to see everyone have a smile on their faces.
good,This is a pretty good fob for someone who is in high school and college as if you give them your hours they are willing to work around them and it is also a fairly easy job.
good,A lot of work with not great pay. Leads to a lot of stress. Always had people not showing up thus having to get people from other departments who were not as knowledgeable about where product went thus created stress.
good,depends on the management if you will enjoy your work. Different stores having different managers will run the store in different ways. However moving from store to store is fairly easy.
good,Need a more stable situation that will allow me to work a lot of hours . Walmart was always a temporary job until I could find something better for myself and my family
good,"Hour lunch is a plus for some people.  I was lucky enough to be hired as a full time associate which is rare for cashiers at least in the areas ive worked.  Ive relocated and worked at 3 different Walmart locations Antioch, Ca. Clovis, Ca. and Meridian, ID.  If you're a good employee with no coaching's on your record transferring stores is easy to arrange, also a plus.  If you want to remain a full time associate you have to maintain a completely open availability for your schedule or else youll lose hours.  This means no days off consecutively and often closing and then opening etc other inconvenient schedules."
good,"Working for Walmart use too be great "
good,"stressfull work environment, company has gone more corporate direction thatn what original owner had intended, they should look at management restructuring"
good,A typical work day would consist of restocking and helping customers find specific items. Greeting customers and helping out the rest of my coworkers was common.
good,I informed them on the day of hire that I would be returning to school and also I am an ordained Minister so working Sundays is not possible because of my ministerial demands on Sundays and some Saturdays. My manager continues to schedule me on the very days I am unavailable making it difficult for me to complete my school obligations as well as my ministerial obligations.
good,"It’s a very demanding job and very fast pace. You never know when you will be clocking out because the case number changes every day, so you could be wrorking a 6hr shirt or a 10hr or a 16 hr shift which makes it really hard to plan out your after work stuff."
good,"A typical day at work when dealing with internal and external customers is rewarding."
good,"I worked as a Cap 2 associate (Walmart's name for evening stocker), and it is fast-paced (so days go by quickly), stressful (there's almost always too much to do), and depending on your coworkers and managers, it could be an extremely bad or pretty decent place to work. If you can deal with the stress put down on you every day its an ok job and it's usually easy to get hired."
good,"The job itself was very easy to catch onto as it never changed did the same thing everyday. hours are always guaranteed for the most part, the environment itself was very fun lots of different ethnic groups and age gaps between all the people. if needing a part time job id highly recommend"
good,"It's a good starting job, I personally believe everyone should work retail at least once in their life so they understand how a place like or similar to walmart works."
good,"While management aren't total jerks, the job itself is hard and thankless. it's a constant rush to get everything done, and you're expected to work at an almost breakneck pace."
good,You would have to unload a truck for about 2-3 hours and seperate them by the different departments. Then unload the grocery truck and sperate them by the aisles. Then take you break. Go stock until 6pm and then go on your lunch break depending on the hours you are working.
good,Always changing my schedule without asking . Managers learned your numbers and did changes without asking. Always on you and disrespectful more often than not
good,"Always kept you busy, and sometimes stressed over finishing projects that would be daunting. Teammates were great, and a very diverse group of individuals."
good,"I would  get there early before my shift started and printed out who was working and who called in for the day. Then we would have management meeting to get the notes our store manager assinde to each assistant manager. Then I would go to floor and have a hub meeting with my department managers to hand out notes and go over what freight needed to be worked for the day. Then I would follow up with them to see if they had any price changes, mods, or picks that needed to be completed. And following up with customer concerns throughout the day. The enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customer happy, knowing they would come back and shop at my store."
good,"Working and managing employees, increasing productivity in work place, with inventory accountability. Manage store unsupervised, and decision making on a daily basis"
good,"clock in, pick or dispense "
good,Walmart itself is a good company to work for but for the management in the location I worked at was horrible. I would and able to return to Walmart and would recommend a job to others.
good,"We had a terrible year in regards to weather."
good,Poor management. Would be a good place if that issue was resolved. They don’t listen to the employees. Store manager prefers to be a butt instead of listening. They just try to look out for themselves and jump onto everybody else.
good,"The company direction changed greatly 5 - 10 years ago and it increasingly became chaotic.  Direction changed monthly, constant reorganizations, and projects that came and went with little support.  There is a lot of bureaucracy, and it is difficult to get things done because job roles are split and there is little cooperation to be found."
good,Well being a greeter at walmart was only annoying because the customers were acting like you were taking them to jail when you were asking them for their receipts. Also there was machine that we had to use for returns at customers service so we could put a sticker on it for them we had to use our job login to use it  my login would not work and i would ask my manager if he could fix it he said he would fix it but he never did Also when i would have to call out i needed his approval but he would never answer his phone
good,It was a okay place to work for I guess the money wasn't to decent and there was no vibe to it just very boring and would probably not recommend to much people
good,"The work load at Walmart can tend to be a lot and the pay does not compensate for the time and the work that is needed."
good,"Walmart has good benefits, it is all about metrics and sales. Good company to take your career to the next level. lots of directions and paperwork to file."
good,I had a good time working at walmart. I would like to say look for opportunities and you will find it.Sometimes it gets hard but its all good.Had good times working with good managers and the experience really make a difference.
good,Constantly changing of the same things. Instructions vary from day to day. Company program is not followed as it should be. Very little room for advancement after Assistant manager.
good,"- Kept you in shape as you unload between 800-2000 pieces off trucks per day"
good,The Walmart I worked at was Adequately run and managed. The management showed genuine compassion towards employees while still maintain a professional attitude.
good,manager does not know how to communicate with employees lets others talk to you instead of her if need any type of help the CSM takes forever or refuses to come and fix machines when need it management is poor needs lots of work
good,"Typically come in and stock freight that was left over by previous shifts due to poor management of associates. Management would typically give more favor to the departments they were over instead of thinking about the store as a whole and would pull team away from our normal processes. Several times would have hours cut only for management to turn around and expect the normal amount of work to get done in less time or try to offer ""overtime"" instead of just scheduling the team the normal hours."
good,"this company has allowed me to grow and learn. I enjoy working and having trainable moments with my team on a daily basis. "
good,"Customer service plays a big part in my everyday work and gaining better experience in handling customers. I started over on the Food Side till that job was eliminated, then I went to Toys for a few years, and moved up to Sporting Goods. I have learned most of every procedure in most, if not all departments. Want to move up to department manager or higher but college may cause problems with that."
good,There is farovtism at this store hard to move up due to the store manger and his favoritism has been going on the whole time he's there not fair to the people that deserve to be moved up
good,"The first thing I would do is walk the department , check the freight that came in over night,walk the department and zone to check for outs,goto the pull merchendice from the back and restock,build any features ,for items need, helped asst the customer's as needed."
good,Management didn't manage my time correctly on days needed to cut time. Management didn't properly manage department supervisor when supervisor was becoming over whelmed by work duties and didn't give adaquite help needed to have a productive department
good,Walmart is a stressful quick paced environment. The customers are the most stressful part of working at Walmart. They can be rude and if you aren't able to deal with rude customers I don't think retail is for you.
good,"Management team needs to be more aggressive and assertive with their employees, also if there is a rule. It should be for everyone including your friends."
good,"Working at Walmart is not fulfilling. Everyone told me not to apply, but I didn't believe them. The pay is worth it sometimes. It pays the bills and I am thankful for that, but I would rather work somewhere that is fulfilling rather than draining."
good,never work for this company overly worked and under paid theres always that one favorite coworker that gets all the easy jobs and weekends off and gets all the hours while we out he suffering to get 30hrs
good,"the job was okay and easy enough, but the managers never talked to each other and we ended up with like five different managers telling us to do something different from what the others were telling us."
good,"A typical day at work is very easy as a cashier. You don't have to worry about your break or lunch because your supervisor schedules it and sends you. The hardest thing is learning codes for produce. You can learn very valuable customer service in this role. It is an easy role to shine in if you are fast and friendly."
good,"I started working there in the grocery department, which i enjoyed. Then was moved over to fashion which i did not enjoy , was then transferred to cahier which i enjoyed. I was not getting enough hours."
good,"Ser dinámica y educada, tratar de ayudar siempre a tus companeros"
good,Walmart used to be a great place for employment. After. 911 in New York City the company went out of its way to take the enjoyment out of the job. The company is to involved now with technology and computers. Retail and groceries are basic common sense jobs that don't necessarily need alot of computer science. They are too busy trying to put people out of work.
good,Things have changed drastically at Wal-Mart and I feel that it is no longer a good or secure place to work.  They seem to be losing ground on the competition and are desperately trying to change things to keep up.
good,working at Wal-Mart taught me so much about people and ho fast management would throw you under the bus to save their own skin. it was a job and nothing more.
good,The job is kind of stressful because they don’t provide us with enough benefits but it pays well. Management is horrible definitely with your hours if you are part time.
good,"When I worked at Walmart, it was decent. The work atmosphere was fast paced, team oriented. I came to not like the job, the supervisor was rough on me."
good,I think Walmart is Somewhat a cool work environment but at the same time it is not at the one I’m currently at Very poor  management but other than that it’s cool you come across nice people ..
good,"Walmart is a great place to work. However, it is only a great place when you have the mangers that actually do their jobs. Not only that, but also have to stick and apply to their own words."
good,"Walmart is Walmart. Its a corporate job that puts operations above employees. Quite like Amazon, so I've heard. Benefits are decent. Pay is way to little for what you do. The management I encountered was pretty good. I have seen horrible management at other stores though. Very work based. You come in everyday dreading your shift and leave worn out."
good,"The ideal of the culture is solid, but changes over the last 5 years have led to pockets where incompetent managers wring their Associates out trying to keep up with the deliverables they aren't equipped to handle. Ask a lot of questions about the team and get a feel for the culture before accepting a job. But, find a great manager, you'll enjoy working here until they move them to a new position."
good,"Wal-Mart is a good first time job employer or retail work. Not alot of room for advancement, not enough employees to accommodate customers. The work is fast paced and you do stay busy. Holidays are a bit crazy."
good,"for the most part I enjoyed working in the deli. I especially enjoyed  making the rotisserie chicken, and joy it brought to the customers that bought them,"
good,Get to work and get the day started. Typically what every jod does. Learn a lot about all the company and what it stands for. Management was very good and the work place was the same. Friendly environment for everyone.
good,"There are managers in the company that are home grown and lack the ability to grow or commit to change.  They are literally afraid of new thoughts and ideas.  Management workforce could use upgrading, need more individuals with degrees and a varied business background."
good,"- dealing with customers is always taxing but overall it is not a terrible place to work."
good,"Loved this job bcuz got to meet new people and different things. You worked with team members to either help with displays or a fellow cashier, customers were the bomb every understanding."
good,"Walmart has a great environment of looking to put the right person in the right spot. This has allowed me to be in several different positions over the years, from a part-time produce associate to a full-time Department Manager of Cosmetics. Each new role has given me a chance to grow and shaped my life in different ways."
good,poor environment for employees poor management I had to teach new employees the proper way to do tasks they hired new employees with no experience with vehicles  . bad customer experience I had certain customers have me only work on there vehicles due outstanding service and trust.
good,"I've been working for walmart for 4 years now and never ever have I in my life experience terrible mangment till now,. they don't care about their associates. keeping cutting our hours."
good,"Working for Walmart can be very stressful, Management will work with you if you need extended time off, as well as having resources available to help their employees with day to day life. BUT, It can still be insane, with not enough people to cover, or serve the customers. Breaks are not always a guarantee, they change their polices quiet frequently, so knowing how things work is a pain."
good,was a great job but the managers sucked. There was no communication and a lot of favoritism. Also managers will lie to your face and not even bat a eye. Other than that great place to work if you are looking for a secure job that brings home a pay check every couple weeks.
good,I loved working at Walmart until I got fired for someone else mistake. I took a zone manager position and was working down the paper goods isle and a thirty seven year old man climbed on the steal as we have done many times before.we both got fired for unsafe work practices.
good,"It was an ok place to work I love working with the public so that was a plus, people who I work with were nice. Not enough hours and the scheduled hours were to late."
good,It was a busy place to work and you couldn’t always finish the tasks you were chosen to do. Had a lot of close work friends that I had lunch with every day.
good,Walmart can give you great benefits but at times can become very stressful. Work and home balance at times becomes nearly imposible to manage. Would not recommend management to someone who has a family.
good,"I put my heart and soul into that company and the pay/benefits were better than most. There sick leave policy is bad. I went to the hospital with a kidney stone. I had documentation of this trip and a note from the ER and because the ER would not fill out the papers to send to their third party, that is stupid, I accumulated too many points. Thing is they changed this policy in February 2019 and since then I had two bouts of the flu and this stone because management doesnt care  people dont want to lose their jobs so they work even when they should not resulting in a lot of lethargic sick people spreading the same stuff over and over. Unless you can literally afford to go to the doctor or be sick about 7 days a year this job is not for you. Not worth the pay or stress."
good,"Walmart is an equal opportunity employer. I was hired the day I graduated high school and have worked there ever since, hoping to go full-time but always given the run around about hours."
good,"The management wasn't that good. The Co workers were ok. It's fast paced, mangers are always up your butt. Sometimes you don't get much help. But the place is ok. I'll work there again someday"
good,"This is a wonderful job experience. I can say that some of the people in management positions should not be in those positions. Some do not know how to treat their workers yet alone want to pay them. But, Walmart as a company is a wonderful place to start off at, but do not plan to stay long."
good,"I left Walmart over ten years ago. However,  at the time, they did offer a fair compensation and the employee benefits were great. Most people think that Walmart only pays minimum wage and that is not the case. Walmart pays based on your job role and your experience."
good,Working at walmart you are constantly on your feet. You are constantly working and can't really leave your area. In my area I was manning the photo lab section as well as site to store and helping return products to the correct shelves.
good,A diverse company with many different assets in place. Constantly positioning itself for growth and development in a competitive field. Providing many opportunities for growth.
good,"Most of the time always had to deal with complaints about price match not working, as well as trying to use coupons that have been expired. Coworkers were amazing to work with, since they will help out as much as possible."
good,over a  million different items sold in each store  memory is key to success in that company. policy vary's store to store  not one store is the same just the customers and  crew seem to be that same in my mind.
good,"If you value yourself, I wouldn't recommend working here. It is extremely time consuming. The higher up you go on the corporate ladder, the less time for yourself/family you will have. If you enjoy making other people wealthy apply now. If your looking for a job apply now. If you want more for your life. DO NOT APPLY!"
good,always busy store. very high demand customer service requirements. friendly environment. if it wasn't because I had to leave the state I would still be working there
good,Not the worst place to work if you need the money. The customers are probably the worst part of the job. They rarely respect the workers and the managers often defend the customers and not the workers.
good,My typical day was kind of hectic but i loved working with the people. Every one had smiling faces and everyone liked each other. The hours kind of sucked but all in all good place to work.
good,Could really ask for any better job. The only thing is the attendance records they have. Only allowed 4 absences while working there. Tht not enough especially out on medical
good,"The managers there were always rude to the employees "
good,They expect you to do what you were hired to do with no if and or buts. At least they give breaks. But even then they are short and they don't give food.
good,"I loved working for certain management and people but the others are extremely pushy and not willing to help much. Most posess, the do as I say not as I do attitude. It cause lots of turbulence through the store from the he said/ she said stories. But all in all a super reliable company with benifits for your life away from work. The negatives will be there no matter where your employed so it's a test of character and reaction each day, something I really enjoyed!"
good,It’s wonderful to be making a wedding cake for a bride and her watching you make the roses. And here smiling with joy. Clean and busy. Immediate supervisors are kind
good,"Medium to High pace work environment leads to stressed work force if you can get past all the management issues, employee issues, pay issues, and Walmarts natural store drama. It's a nice place to work"
good,"My experience with Walmart has been a rollercoaster as far as hours go. I try to management school work and my job at Walmart, but now my hours does not help my financial stability. Right now my hours are at about 15 a week which sucks."
good,Walmart is a positive environment to work in. Management is always supportive and there for you if you need assistance. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting customers and making their shopping experience pleasurable.
good,"I’ve work in both the store (Dunwoody) and now the warehouse (ATL1). The pay is pretty good; it’ll get you somewhere. The least you’ll start with is $13.50 at the warehouse, but honestly not all money is good money. Management is ever changing. Rules come out of nowhere. Every time you turn around your getting a point for something. The most recent issue with the point system has been “productivity “. That’s actually one of their favorite words, that and “safety”. You can honestly work your hardest, but if work slows or you’re doing anything productive (and they’re aware) and it can’t be scanned (ie downstacking) look forward to an occurrence. It gets better; I received an occurrence for productivity and I wasn’t in the building period. Their logic was I “wasn’t singled out, everyone got one that day so its cool.” They don’t fight for their people, they replace you. You would think before passing out one to everyone they would think to investigate it. Doesn’t it sound strange, almost everyone including two people who were out on bereavement. Yes, we can open door most things, but you get tired of running back and forth. "
good,I liked working there for the most part. It was a good store. I had nice people I worked with and the department manager was a very nice man. I hated to have to quit.
good,"I've worked at Walmart for almost 3 years. It's not a bad facility, at least not the one where I'm employed. I just feel that there could be better communication within specific departments and associates individually with the amount that is expected. The store could be a stressful environment at times so more broad and direct communication is necessary. Just my opinion."
good,"Everyone i worked with so far has been really helpful, and plus days go by fast. None stop work, so you'll be constantly moving. Management will go out of their way to help u with any situation you may have and their also willing to lesd by example and stock and work when needed."
good,"positive: there was always work to do if you were a hard worker you received hours and breaks were on time. "
good,para primero empleo esta bien pero el salario es muy poco
good,"I like working at Walmart if you find a department that you like to work in but I do not like how it is run, not the management at my particular store but the higher bosses."
good,Every store is different. I worked for a store in a college town that was extremely busy all the time. It was very stressful. Most of the stress came from the constant turnover of employees and lack of consistent training on how things were to be done properly. This resulted in a lot of work being pushed off to other employees instead of it being done when it was supposed to.
good,"Honestly, I personally wouldn't recommend it, but if your are just getting out of High school. But its honestly not going to allow an adult to afford living."
good,"Wal-Mart was a very busy workplace but was filled with great employees who provided the best services possible to fit the needs of the customer. The experience there was memorable and overall pleasant. It was a fast-paced work environment with many difficulties happening over the course of the day, from the computers not working to overall customer satisfaction."
good,"When I was left alone to do my job I felt pretty great. A lot of times managers would stop you from what you were doing to lecture you or pull you to another department which I feel hindered on my job that was suppose to be done that day. Even with their multiple distractions they expect things to get done. Management occasionally argued over leadership and who was in charge of what. At 8 months pregnant I was asked to go push carts outside during a snow storm by 2 upper management women, even though they asked two young male associates to run front end register. Not exactly a bright group that managed that particular store."
good,"With WALMART's new changes to the flow of inventory and store control it has become a nightmare to work at. There new motto of ""do more with less"" makes working there stressful and heavily timed on everything you do. They have cut hours for all departments but still expect the same level of output which is impossible inless your store is already rocking 100%."
good,Walmart was good but not enough hours given . Management needs to give clear directions. Overall the time I worked there was cool and busy during peak hours .
good,"i learned how to stocker correctly at a fast pace so that i can get my work done in like 2 hours while there is like 6 hours of total freight to be done in that 1 aisle, some of the management at walmart is ok but some of them wants to overwork you, i cant say this is true for all walmart stores but for at least my store its like that."
good,To many upper managers never enough workers. It's a good first job but would not recommend making it a career. If u want to move up it's not based on your work it's how much u suck up
good,"Great first time job. They have made many changes lately cut benefits and not very many full time jobs, It does not seem like they want to keep employees around long term. It sure is not the American dream. I have met a lot of good people there and wish them all well. I would like to be able to stay. But it seems like they are eliminating many of the jobs. I am looking to work for a company that actually values their employees. The medical they offer is only good for major medical. And Vacation time has been cut. Even for the long term employees."
good,"There's opportunities for growth."
good,The managers have favorites and they don’t judge fairly when it comes to job advancement  there is nothing good to say about this place of employment. I can say it does give you a job when there is nothing else available
good,Good starting salary. Not great place for long time associates. There is no respect for long time associates. Changes should be more store specific while using overall company guidelines.
good,"The management made the rules they didn't follow policy."
good,"Experiences will  be different for everyone. "
good,"I loved working at Walmart when I first started there. Management would treat you very well, fair, and treat you like family. I started the job in Cap 2 receiving. About two months of being there, I was asked if I would transfer departments, which came with a pay raise, and I took it. I transferred to Fresh Cap 2, and I loved it. about two months of being in that department everything started to change. Our manager stopped caring about our department, and her workers. Recently all Walmart associates were guaranteed a set schedule, and if you have open availability, you would benefit from this greatly. The only workers this benefits are the full time, supervisors, and management. I was cut from 32 hours a week down to 19 hours a week."
good,"Very fast paced environment, and can be sometimes unorganized. A typical day in my job role consists of at least 1 apprehension of shoplifters a day, if not more. Ensuring associates are abiding by the safety regulations can be tedious if the associates don't know who you are or what your job entails."
good,"J'adorais travailler chez Wallmart mais la superviseure était exigeante et un autre me lançait des boîtes lorsque je déchargeais les vannes à la réception."
good,"No hay oportunidad de crecer por tu esfuerzo y dedicación ,aunque uno sobresalga no lo toman en cuenta"
good,As a Manger I worked long hours to cover gaps to ensure deadlines and service to customers were met. Hands on training with mangers and highly skill associates to promote teamwork
good,"If you’re really in need of a job great take it but if you can find something better then take it. Walmart can be a very stressful job depending at which store or which managers you have, there’s also a lot of Favoritism and hard work isn’t Appreciated."
good,I've worked for Walmart for about 3 years and the first year went by fine but then we had a whole change of management change and things were hectic.A normal work day is busy me helping every customer that comes to me and sending them to the correct location of the item that they were looking for. I've learned how to be a team worker. Hardest part of the job being thrown to any part of the store I have the least knowledge in. Most enjoyable the nice customers i get to help and talking to and learning from my fellow co-workers.
good,Learned a lot. Look forward to new challenges. Fast pace stores are where associates are more distant. Small town stores make you feel more like family.
good,Expect a lot for pay. Some shift changes without agreement. Too lenient with most employees.  Meeting and interacting with people  is the best part about the job.. nice bonus in April if the store did well all year.
good,"Typical day was, walk in, sign in, do your work, and leave. Working there wasn't easy, but it was fun to meet new people, and most of the people whom i worked with were generally friendly, and enjoyable people. The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart was seeing the broad spectrum of people who come to the store on a day to day basis."
good,The job its self was easy but the management always wanted to change something and always only wanted cap team 2 to do the work. We were sometimes able to keep overtime and then sometimes they would send us home early on Friday so we weren't able to keep our overtime.
good,"Provides good pay/benefits for pharmacists, but heavy workload, limited support staff. Heavy emphasis on customer service. Never feel like all work is done. High expectations for productivity. Schedule is not very flexible."
good,"Walmart had good employees, but the managers was young and borderline unprofessional. They showed a lot of favoritism and when there was a customer who needed help from a salaried manager they almost never come out of their office for them."
good,Perhaps some walmarts are run well . that was not my experience at carson city stores.  The human resource ladies are lazy and let too many good emplyees fall through cracks.
good,"It usually depends in which team you are working, they promised me a Full time, but kept on delaying the from several months, also they end up hiring inexperienced contractors which gave a lot of burden to cover up their work"
good,"I loved this job, it was overall pleasant, not too slow, usually not terribly busy. It had balance. When I needed more hours I was able to work in another department. It all depends on your manager though, my last manager was less than desirable and resulted in multiple people leaving their good jobs."
good,"Typical day - Check your work assignment, run conveyor freight, load pallets."
good,Great for students or retired people. There really is no downside provided you don't mind little pay and high expectations. Standards for employees have dropped over the years but it is easy work with little stress.
good,"Worked there for about 6 years and looking into something more. They work with your hours pretty good, but not enough benefits and working with some are stressful"
good,Decent job to work but the management is terrible. The opportunities for advancement are limited even though I supervised my own team while they looked for someone else to fill the job
good,Most days than not there were times where we couldn't finish our work by the time we had to clock out. It was unorganized and the shifts before did not finish their tasks. The managers were always blaming each other. The silver lining of Walmart was the other associates that I worked with.
good,to wright my shifts work hours for the week and ensure all persons are efficient in getting there assign work  completed in a safe manner that makes our team TOP competitive.
good,"Need money,  work here however if you want to advance you better make friends with managers. Dont report any managers otherwise they will retaliate even though that is against company policy. Need fulltime hours while only being a part time associate this is the job for you."
good,fast paced. more responsibility given for low pay wages. Management wants you to be in charge of your department. When you plan what you need to do in your department it doesn't matter because management tell you what they want done with no regards to the plans you devise.
good,"I honestly enjoyed my time being employed at Walmart. I met many amazing people and made a lot of wonderful friends there. However, I do believe that even if I had been hired on permanently that I would never be able to amount to anything more than a simple retail associate. I can't say the same for other Walmarts, but the one I was employed at was very close knit, and was just a group of people who didn't want newcomers taking their positions. A vast majority of the older employees and the ones who had been there for years were very aggressive and rude."
good,if this is your first job then this is the place for you. if your older and have kids this isnt for you. no fixed hours for some positions. they play favorites
good,"Your experience depends on your location, obviously. My Management team was not great, they lacked communication skills and sales associates were doing their jobs. Also I did a store build,yes NOT rebulid, but BUILD. We were wearing hardhats and safety vest, but no steel toes boots...hmmmm. Also no matter your position at the neighborhood market I was employed with, everyone was paid the same, outside of managers."
good,Too many changes in the wrong direction. The  new attendance policy pentalizes the ones who actual showed for work. and then losing vacation time with the new attendance policy. and the new core hours is resulting in loss of my 40 hrs a week to barely 33 hrs a week. cant pay bills with that.
good,Walmart is verysthicf and to the point. if you aren't on there mindset you won't enjoy yourself. if you mango into work ignore your atmosphere and just work and go home its the job for you.
good,"The scheduling system is unreliable and even though the hours are flexible, they are sometimes cut. The discount is limited. The environment is stressful when some necessary assistance is not provided."
good,Basic cashier job. Fine for a college student. My managers were fine. Getting time off was not the most convenient. Don't expect holidays off. No holiday pay.
good,"I received training and experience in an entry level position in stocking, receiving and forklift operation.  Transferring to another location was easy."
good,"Management needs more people training, very unprofessional, every body is buddies and have their groups/clicks.  Very rude to customers and associates."
good,"My typical work day included standing at one of the three store entrances and greeting/dismissing customers, while checking return orders, and calling attention to store security when needed.  I learned it is important to be friendly with any customers that will allow the interaction, as they can become your best supporters.  Management was a split thing, half were truly hard working, whether or not company showed up, the other half really only cared about review week.  Strong emphasis on Customer first with ads, but from the interior it was quite obvious that it was company first.  Telling people they could not do something, even if they already knew it, and having to deal with their anger, or outbursts.  Making people around me smile, or making children and their parents happy to shop at my store."
good,"Walmart likes to move its people around and that's very stressful at times. You're hired to work in one dept. and get pulled to another. There are days. When you can't finish your assigned tasks because of this, It's MOST annoying."
good,Very challenging place to work for an extended period of time due to the amount of change with lack of tech and tools to support your business.  With the layoffs in recent years it has added a massive amount of workload to those who were good enough to survive.  Pay is under the current market with no outlook to be corrected.
good,"Job used to be worth talking about.  Then they changed managers. Horrible one they just keep moving around.  Ruined team and degraded the job.  Some times you get lucky, others - not so much."
good,"Walmart is not the worst place to work, it is just hard to make a living working there. Even working 40 hours it's hard to afford many of my bills. Holidays and sometimes birthdays are uneventful. Of course, I make by. Walmart has been good to me though when I was in my car accident they helped me secure my job while I was healing."
good,This job is great for teenagers and or collage students. although some days of dealing with customers and staff can be trying every ones not always on the same page.
good,"Lack of training, managers don't care what you do to get your job done. There are some awesome customers and some terrible customers. I get stress sometimes because of customers."
good,pay is low benefits  are ok lots of physical work for the pay almost warehouse work but you get paid minimum wage. definitely not recommend for people looking for higher pay. work environment was good management a little pushy but some are good.
good,I was disappointed being hired in a specific position & only there a week before someone else was hired for my full time position & I was moved to random departments without notice.
good,"The days are very repetitive, conditions are good, there was an incident with the management of an employee making a complaint and being reprimanded severely."
good,typical day would include clocking in and surveying my department on whats been sold throughout the day and what needs to be stocked also surveying the backroom to make sure its well organized for all shifts
good,"Since working for Walmart I have noticed the company has become more strict on time. No time other than break and lunch to use restroom, warehouse is huge takes time to get to restroom.  If there is no work flow employees are still held accountable for not making rate for their work assigned."
good,"A typical day was full of good and bad customers it was hectic fun and a good learning experience."
good,"If you can hack working at Walmart, your can hack pretty much any retail job. Lots go opportunity for advancement if you are with the right management group."
good,"Management oftentimes changed schedules under our noses which resulted in often inconsistent work schedules, and they often cut hours with no extra shifts to pick up. During my time there, there was a workplace incident where I was the victim of theft by two employees and management failed to respond with action accordingly when I informed the store manager and those two employees were still allowed to work with no repercussion. The job itself was enjoyable, especially if you like the fact-paced nature of the job, but management may be lackluster. Often times we didn't get our breaks on time or at all, save for our lunch, and many times we had to go over our scheduled shift times due to lack of staffing, where they then hounded us about not getting overtime and made us take longer lunches to compensate."
good,"I like working at Walmart, but they had no benefits, and the wages weren't enough. I liked my job, and the people i worked with. I learned alot about the bakery and management. I had to close and be in control of the night shift. The hardest part of my job was trying to get everything done, as we were understaffed. It was a respectful and courteous place to work and I like that about it. They train you well and expect you to be courteous to customers. I enjoyed getting to help serve people and meet new people."
good,"The management there was terrible! All of the managers would take breaks at the same time if they wanted and there was no one to help assist a customer if they needed something done. The store manager was not doing his job properly and showed favoritism amongst certain assistant managers. It was also poor management as far as employees, if an employee is lazy they aren't told to pick up the pace, instead the hardworking employees had to pick up their slack. It was almost like it's your fault if you want to do your best at your job, now you have to take on more responsibilities because someone else doesn't want to do their job. However at this job I have met and networked with a lot of different people. I would say the only good thing about the job were the people that came in. It was great talking to the customers, I've learned new things I haven't learned before and it has help me enhance my ability to speak to others, what seems appropriate to say and what doesn't. I do thank Walmart for this because it has taught me how to connect with people. My greeting put smiles on the people's walking in and out those doors, most said ""You don't belong here, you're too nice!"" Those were the best times of my day and that is what kept me going. The harassment was also another issue that some of my coworkers have faced. There were also people in the job that worked for 3 or 4 years with no promotions available to them when they have been working for it for as long as they've been there. A lot of unfair things going on behind closed doors that corporate should know or may have already figured"
good,"Great place the work, really nice people I love the schedule I love the raises and vacations payout we received from the company every year I was very pleased with our sales performance and the reason we were so excited about the work place"
good,I worked at the bakery/deli and was a cashier as needed. Walmart provided training for any job they required you to do. They were also very flexible with the schedules.
good,"Its both good and bad depending on your management team, a lot of them are hired from different jobs proceeding the one at Walmart, and they often aren't suited for management positions"
good,"When I was first hired by Walmart, I was told I would be able to easily manage my school work and still get to participate in my after school activities. However, i quickly realized no manager actually cared about my education and how my high school experience was."
good,If you are a general employee the job is not bad.  Managers are not given constistant help to insure sucess. The management school is offered to late to have impact. If you are a general employee and want to work every single weekend it is great.  Managment has great pay and hours but one person will not be able to take care of an entire dept. when store managers are pick only certain departments to send people running to help.
good,Poor management team at times. Need more of a team effort on a lot of things. When it comes too workers needs they are not management be intereste. Need more communication with the team.
good,"My first three years at Wal-Mart went well but after earning three yearly raises, they suddenly became critical of things by making up faults you didn't do.  When two people work on the same drawer during the same shift and the drawer isn't counted down until the end of the night, then the first or last cashier shouldn't be accountable for a shortage greater than five dollars at the end of the day.  If I was the sole cashier on a single register and the count didn't match then I would be accountable, but it is not possible to blame one cashier for a shortage if multiple cashiers worked on the same register.  Being blamed for calling a hotline number after I was threatened by a co-worker was the last straw.  She should have been fired and they didn't fire her and I don't know why because it was in the handbook that any employee who threatens another employee with any bodily harm whatsoever would be terminated.  That never happened so I called the hotline to complain and followed company procedure in doing so as I went through the chain of command to ask why she wasn't left go after they knew she threatened me. I felt that they weren't concerned and twisted the facts around so that I would leave and they would not have to pay me another raise for another year. Shortly after I left Wal-Mart went to hiring most of their workers as Part time instead of full time. This was in the Newspaper in articles published about the problems Wal-Mart had in the early years after 2000."
good,"learned a lot about tires went to a class on tires,learned about oil changes tire ratings sizes speed rating hoe  to test batteries,sell new ones to fit cars"
good,"Cashier."
good,"Cleaning Taking out bad produces restock take out trash."
good,"Walmart was a great place to work in the earlier years.  There was great opportunities to continuously learn, gain experience and move within the company."
good,Lots of departments where you can gain experience. Flexible scheduling is available and great options like benefits and stocks. Ability to relocate anywhere.
good,The store I worked at employed a lot of high school/college students. It was a chore trying to get them to be professional. The managers at this location did not help.
good,I think it all depends on which location you're at and who you're working with but this can be a decent job. I actually showed up when scheduled and did my job so I was basically treated faily. Get REALLY good shoes!
good,I would definitely consider going back to Walmart but I want to expand my horizon a little bit more. I didn't see many opportunities where I was. And due to a lack of understanding between employee and management I didn't see very much advancement at all.
good,"Great job, terrible management. Made working there much worse than it needed to be, constantly understaffed and management would only get mad at their employees for being unable to complete a 5 person task with 2 employees."
good,Managers do not lead by example. There is definately favortism. They tend to look the other way. Like anywhere some managers are better than others. They don't tend to look for the bad ones to weed them out or don't care. They expect alot with very little offered.
good,"Job was always productive. Some days slower than others, some days were very busy but still pretty balanced. Most of management was fair and trained employees properly"
good,"I worked in the deli which was faced paced most of the day. It was always something to do which I enjoyed. The pay was pretty good for our department, and most of the employees were cool. Only downside was being short staffed, it was days I had to work alone."
good,over all i enjoyed my time at walmart it job it self was fun and easy i learned a lot of things doing my time there its the management that makes the job seem so much more harder to do but its a good starter job and you will learn a little bit of everything
good,Great place to work if you are looking for a job where you are not particularly valued as an employee. I would suggest this job to a friend as a temporary position.
good,"stock shelves,keep clean working area,backup cashiers.busy but fun since you on some days would do multiple tasks tagging boxes for inventory  flex when needed"
good,"Walmart is ok to work there, just don't get fired there, they will not let you work there again. When I worked there I had a good experience and bad experience."
good,Walmart is squeezing everything they can right now... reducing positions and focusing on e-commerce.  Retail can be demanding and fun... but it's never easy!
good,"Very rude, but i really never had a problem with the work schedule because i always worked so i was always in the schedule but overall the management for Walmart could be better."
good,A typical day at work was stressful and management was not available for questions. I was a difficult work environment. Workplace culture was lacking in structure
good,Poor management training. Too many chiefs not enough Indians. A lot of communication breakdowns between management teams. They are good people but the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing
good,"you start by greeting your customer's. If their is any problems your managers come to help. Its a good place to work out you meat different people every day. The hardest part is when your running out of money on your register , and you have to call your customer service managers. The nice thing  that your customer understand that its not your fault. Just to be able to know that you made some ones day by just treating them nice and telling them have a great day with a smile on your face."
good,the amount of pay Veres the amount customer flow does not equal the pay 265 billion we get pay 19000 to 26000 pre year of that .the work hour is great and the discount is ok the work is only hard by how many customer we have
good,"Afraid of retaliation, market managers make up their own rules , pick favorites and push people out of positions. As an hourly employee you get paid a really good wage to start. Unfair balance to those who were with the company for 20 years and making as much as the cart boys and girls. Don’t quit or get fired, the company is so cheap they refuse to pay any unemployment. Eliminating job positions and they do try to place employees in other positions. Realistically, the employees are very unhappy about that."
good,"Walmart can be a great job, the associates can be fun and make the day go fast and easy. But if you know more than one department or it’s a very busy day, management has been known to throw you into another area to do something else. Even if you don’t know that department, they will still throw you over there and expect results even though you don’t know what you’re doing. Other than these simple facts, Walmart can be a good place for a first job."
good,Working for Walmart distribution was good in the beginning and as time went on management was getting more pressure to hit orders.  Order fillers were worked way to hard in my opinion.
good,"C'est un emploi physique"
good,"typical day at Walmart, meeting the same customers daily, i learn what is the Walmart brand, the hardest is getting help when you need it, enjoyable part, my cashiers."
good,"Busy retail environment with a diverse culture both in staff and customers. Management could be more consistent with policies, etc. Not a bad place to work, room for advancement if that's what you want."
good,"Personally walmart is an amazing and beneficial job. I would have loved to have and still have it because, one, I'm rehirable. Two I loved what i did I worked in food service and costumer service it allowed me to never be bored. But I think the management time personally can benefit from a re-train. They believe and adapt their methods in a coercive and threatening culture that sometimes takes a willing to do anything employee to a discriminated and harassed employee. They use methods that take the option to say no and if you say no or can I finish my task your going to be told to go home, be coached. or be held accountable for a task that is outside of your assigned task or department."
good,"I would come in make sure the money in the till was right, scan each and every item. take all unbought items to customer service so that they could go back to their right areas"
good,"Working at Walmart is pretty fun , it gets pretty repetitive after awhile but it's nice to see and interact with people everyday. I dont like the werid work hours"
good,"My job was to assemble the carts and clean the bathrooms. I started in February of 2018 and was fired in August of 2018 . I missed a few days because of health reasons and the therefore had too many points per 6 months. Overall it was a great experience working there , met a lot of people , made a few friends. I’m a hard worker , a inside job would be better suited for me."
good,"There was always drama, there were some people that were cool though. Word gets around fast, always gossip. Lack of communication between management. A lot of he say she say and thank goodness I was never in any of it, but just things that I witnessed while working there. Can be cutthroat depending on the management. At first everything was great but after new management came in from other stores. Things started to change drastically in the store that I worked at. Even with the benefits you have to wait to qualify but even more once you get them depending on the benefits and what you need, you might have to wait even longer."
good,Management needs more leadership training in order to have a successful operation. There is a lot of buddy systems within Walmart. Jobs are rotated unfairly.
good,it started of pretty fun and a happy place to be then out of nowhere in started to change up. you must be a strong person to work there but the gm was a sweetheart but it was only so much she could do
good,The work really keeps you busy which is a good thing keeping busy makes the day go by fast I have worked there about a year and a half 07/ 2017 till present
good,"As a stepping stone job to something better, Walmart was a good place to work, I loved the people that I worked with. and most of the time the atmosphere was positive,"
good,It’s a great place to work as long as who ever in management likes you or isn’t sexist. Hardly ever switch shifts to accommodate you . Some managers were great others made the job harder like giving you a list of things to do and then telling you they changed their mind and want it differently or completely removed after you finish
good,"I am looking for another position because of the fact they have so many issues from upper management to department managers to floor employees. No one communicates effectively and many things we do are redone several times wasting time and resources. I feel as if they do not listen to us on how things can be improved, but we are never heard."
good,"Pay was great customers were just disrespectful and couldn't handle it anymore, left because of that and the lack of equipment we were provided to attempt to complete our job."
good,"under staffed, over worked and easy to get sick. lack of leadership and management. not respectful of availability. but the staff that does remain are good to work with"
good,"There wasn't really much to say. I personally loved interacting with my customers, and my coworkers were wonderful. I wasn't fond of management, because they weren't very good at managing."
good,"Its very management top heavy. my location seemed a bit homophobic. management was not very approachable. I asked about my current points as i was sick that day and needed to know how many i had but the did not have time to answer my question as they felt i was not important enough. "
good,"This was an awesome place to work at for teens or families. The job is very competitive and fast paced. I enjoyed having met many new people and helping customers who later became regulars. "
good,"Its a minimum wage job.  I've been working at for two years, it isn't a bad job but a lot of the employees don't care about the job and collect a pay check, it makes more work for those that do take it seriously."
good,"Working as a cashier is very stressful, yes I love my job, but there are so many improvements that need to be done. Our breaks and lunches are mostly delayed or too soon, our management doesn't answer the call immediately, and were the ones who normally get yelled at. Cashiers get emotionally and verbally abused everyday. Our benefits are okay, we get a 401K, dental, vision and health insurance, but then again I feel like we are under appreciated or under paid."
good,"Walmarts very stressful,at times need a place were drama does not consume the,areas. Just looking for a nice place to work and not be stressed out or bullied everyday."
good,Depends on where you are. Pay is good. Go in do your job you wont have issues. Management can be difficult to deal with because there's so many managers to listen to.
good,It is a good place to work at. The people that work there is really nice. Sometime u get certain customers that u just can't make happy and there sometime customers that are great. The work place is good it is a job. The only problem I have is that I was getting the hours and now they are cutting the hours trouble where I am in hunt for other job with more hours.
good,Harsh enviroment with no job security. Unsafe condition and barely any teamwork. Company deviate from company on regular basis. Difficult in getting proper working equipment.
good,"I've worked with the company for over ten years and was straight out of high school when I started. I believe if you are teen aged to young 20's its an good place to work. However, I don't necessarily think it should be a lifelong career. Pay is decent, if you don't have a large family to support, benefits are better. I have a good schedule because I am a department manager, so I can't complain about that. Salary management is horrible! They are so worried about pleasing their bosses they don't try to run things in a way to please the customers. Things are constantly changing so you can't get use to any one ""rule"" for too long. Unless you experience it it can be hard to explain, but nonetheless it's like any other low paying retail job out there. A lot of people let the job stress them out."
good,"Walk is a good fun place to work most of the time, but can be very stressful at times especially around the holidays.  The compensation is fair, and employee have plenty of paid time off."
good,"Cap 2 associates work 1400-2300, lunch is not paid. Responsibilities include unloading trucks, stocking shelves, down stacking pallets, providing customer assistance, tagging and slotting overstock. I've been working about 6 months, am on my fourth supervisor, and am one of the senior members of my team."
good,Daily routines and tasks are well defined. Path to promotion is clear and transparent. Enjoyable when the customer is satisfied by your own personal actions. Hardest part of the job is covering any previous shift's misgivings while still be held accountable to complete your own tasks and routines.
good,It qas a nice place to work and it pays good money and that was the reason its pretty high strung becuse you have to make numbers ans if u didnt then its not worth keeping u
good,Ok place to work.  Most of my managers are great to work with. The most frustrating part of my job at Wal-Mart is dealing with disrespectful and entitled customers.   The best part of my job is helping the customers who really appreciate my help and my time.
good,I came in and I clock in and go and push carts and sometimes I put items back on the shelves we call it reshops I would recommend this job as a first time job not as a career.
good,I actually liked my job there because it had decent hours that rarely fluctuate and the pay was alright for starting off but unless you make friends with management there’s very little chance of moving up also if you’re able to make it to a supervisor role you have no backup from upper management regardless of how poorly your associates are preforming they won’t allow you to correct the issue
good,"Must have a tough skin and ignore comments "
good,"I know that I could always get a job at Walmart. Would I want to? No, but if I had to, definitely. I never truly felt at home working there and I knew it wasn't a long time career for me."
good,"Typical day was clock in, wait for orders, print out labels, and start your cleaning and relocating shelves. I learned to work as a team . I managed time that I had to finish job in. Culture was competitive and stable. Hardest part was having the right tools for the job. I enjoyed the at your own pace work"
good,"- Terrible management"
good,"Help get ready the back room, unload the truck andgo start stocking. I learned to fully stock, to unload a truck and orgainze shelves. Management is a mess, just a mess. Either they need re-training or replaced. The hardest part of the job is doing it within the time-limit that management has set. Most enjoyable is during breaks and lunch."
good,"It is a good place to start working for, but not to stay for long term. If you are look for your first job well you are trying to start settling in it is a good place. It is on the other hand not a good place to make a permanent career out of."
good,"Walmart tends to treat its employees as second class citizens.  When applying and/or interviewing for a job, one is often given a spiel about the great wages and benefits and open door policies for resolution of problems, etc.  In truth, Walmart is not a very inviting place to work."
good,I was let go because I got really sick and was unavailable to work. I have lupus an autoimmune disease. It effects my ability to think clearly. And I hurt a lot.
good,Company is ok. Management is not . To much strees. Not enough hours. Minimum wage. We work very hard for a minimum vage. As a cashier I do my job properly.
good,"As a full-time student, this is a perfect place to work at. However, as much the place is fun, management in the store is slowly breaking."
good,"The work is easy labor. The management is the real problem, when I first started the store manger was making promises to his employees that he can't actually keep."
good,"Have to push long line of buggy's , That Walmart does not follower the ADA rules on Service Animals, Hardest part of the job, not being able to keep the electric carts charged for the customers because they only had 6, Enjoyable part, meeting new people, and seeing people you all ready know."
good,usually was underscheduled didn't have many opportunities to learn anything new usually busy between 7am-8pm customers are usually friendly every now and again you get therotten ones
good,professional and fair but did not enjoy the job. did not get the chance to interact with other coworkers in the cashier position and it was tiring work.
good,"Its a nice place to work, but they don't have enough employees for the work load that is expected to get done. "
good,I was a cashier for the summer after high school. They gave you the adequate breaks that they were suppose to - lunch was fair. It wasn't bad for a part time job.
good,"I appreciated the fast pace environment , I like to stay busy. The scheduling was not good, I was scheduled for every weekend. and only one day off within a few day period. I prefer to work 12 hour shifts. The management was poor on the shift I was on and they talk down to the employees which is not an effective way to manage. Hardest part of the job is the management would not allow employees to complete a task before sending to another job task, so basically no task would be completed. They did not follow the SOP of this business unless there was an audit."
good,"The positive feeling working for the company has since gone down, its feel for productivity is rushed and understaffed your overworked. No good feeling for accomplishments."
good,"long hours, low pay and lack of leadership."
good,"I worked in Missouri and Arkansas, I loved Missouri and hated Arkansas. Management was great in Missouri but terrible in Arkansas. Specifically store 144 was terrible with management. I worked in almost all areas of the store except grocery and can verify that walmart is a ok place to work. there are a lot of flaws, but it is still a steady paycheck."
good,A typical day at Walmart is pretty unpredictable but you learn to move with the pace. You have to be quick on your feet and learn to prioritize. It is a decent place to work at.
good,A typical day would include going to the floor and “zoning” the shelves just pulling everything forward and making it look good. Then we would unload trucks anywhere from 500-3500 pieces and anywhere from 1-3 trucks and were required to unload each truck within 2 hours and have all consumables stocked.
good,"Money wise and work in general it is a decent place to work. Getting hours when they were needed became a little tough as well as getting days off that were needed. I had to go to store manager twice just to get days off for school that they were supposed to give me automatically, but my manger did not want to give me them off. When needed something about schedule fixed or something else would take me a week or over a week to get my manager to finally speak to me about it. Started to be only given 16-18 hours a week even though I could work more. Other than those complications I have enjoyed working at Walmart."
good,For my time there I enjoyed working with the people in my area and some of those throughout the store. There are plenty of hard working employees who are dismayed by the way things are run. The inconsistent nature of some in charge makes the work harder than it needed to be.
good,"There needed to be more managers than anything helping the employees, instead of not showing any respect to the ones that was actually trying to do it"
good,Walmart is fine to work for  if you wish to work various shifts. The benefits are good but the pay is poor if your along time employee.  New hires are making more than people there for 4 plus years!
good,Sometimes company was laid back but most stressful part of job was bad management they never cared about their employees and never took employees home life in consideration
good,typical day at work was fast paced but your always stopping to help other employees and end up falling behind on your tasks the most enjoyable time was lunch
good,The job is very stressful. It's hard and we don't get paid enough for the work we do. It's a pretty much take care of yourself job because everybody is for them selves.
good,"Mine and other people's experience of this retailer is that less is more.  There is a saying at Walmart that three times is the Walmart way.  It's best to not try and outwork oneself here, the reward is hardly worth the effort."
good,I had fun working here because it was a fast paced environment and I was able to improve my communication skills. My coworkers were friendly but management was terrible.
good,"Trabaje para la empresa a través de una consultora, la empresa es seria y tiene ben capital humano"
good,The job itself is ok but the manager is horrible.  The work is simple but the people you work with is what makes the job.  Walmart is an ok company to work for.
good,"The company used to be catered to family values. Now it's all about saving them money and working you more with less compensation. The employee gives more and gets less,"
good,"Pretty uptight and management is pretty incompetent most of the time. Furthermore, they will not work with your availability and don't promote based on work ethic but rather personal opinion."
good,Walmart is a fairly decent company to work for. It's easy to move up however there are also struggles and draw backs. They really use and abuse their salary members of managment making work life balance very difficult.
good,Wasn't really the job that made me quit. I would page for a manager to help a customer and they would take forever to come help the customer ( sometimes causing customer to swear at me or leave ). Other times they would call the phone and ask what the customer needed instead of walking to help customer in person. Walmart says customer first but thats not so much the case apparently.
good,It is an okay job for people who need the money in the moment but it is not a job where I would stay for more than a year. There is no drama but drama can arise.
good,"A typical day at work was normally hectic because if we weren't constantly busy with customers in the deli, we were busy with prepping, inventory, helping customers in other areas, and cleaning up messes in the back. I didn't have a very good experience working there because I wasn't taught all the skills required, and management would get upset because my performance wasn't as good. At random times during the month, managers would have a party for themselves or third shift and wanted fresh food, which was a challenge when we shut down the fryers at a certain time."
good,This is a job you would want to work if you have plenty of time and no family. They do not consider that you may have a newborn child at home and that you are a single parent who need a flexiable schedule. If you need a job but with not family and not at home things going on then this is the job for you.
good,"salary is good for cost of living in Helena Mt"
good,Management and HR and terrible people they don't care about people no respect that's not the Walmart way in this building I have never felt so belittled like this before I recommend no body work here and they need to fire all the managers in this building
good,"Direct management team may do what they can, but the overall company culture is pure poison. The different shifts screw each other over hard. The production rates are unreasonable in some departments. Turnover is really high, including management turnover. They dealt with a class action lawsuit for stealing time from employees nationwide. There are other issues that will likely surface in due time."
good,"working at walmart wasn't bad, sometimes they forgot to give you your lunch break or you got it later than you were supposed to. Shifts typically went pretty quickly. Co-workers were pretty nice. Customers tend to get rude."
good,"The bakery section is honestly the best place to work at Walmart. The job is not that hard and people are friendly. You just have to cook some bread every time there's missing bread and prepare the pastries that will be cooked the next day. If you work efficiently, a day can pass really quickly."
good,Wal-Mart was good to me at the beginning. over the course of 5 years though many things had changed. we lost a lot of employees and we weren't getting more in. we were working with a skeleton crew which pushed us to become more stressed at work and the management would find what ever they could to get mad at you about if they didn't like you. since I've left I have kept in contact with previous co-workers whom still work at Wal-Mart and have been told that it has only gotten worse and more stressful
good,better pay and more hours and garneted overtime needed. They expect you to bend over backwards for the most minimal award. No raises. Quart bonuses only after 6 months and the bonus fluctuate.
good,"The worst part of working for Walmart was the inconsistent hours. I could not get a set schedule. Also, getting days off was hard at times. But I liked the fast paced friendly environment."
good,"A very busy merchandise super s store"
good,The work at walmart was not that bad. However the problems stayed consistent and management would do nothing about it. Couple that with only getting 32 hours a week (on a good week) and would have to work 5 days. Many days i would drive the half hour just to work 4 hours.
good,Long hours work life balance is not there used to be family oriented benefits keep rising every year and only a 2% raise every year for everyone no matter how hard you work over the next person management very disrespectful
good,"very fast paced environment, limited training. generally kept very clean and sanitized. co-workers were helpful and polite. this is not a job for someone who cannot multi-task or move fast."
good,Some good repectful managers a d people some not . stressful inviroment. Really high production to meet. Under new management alot different then before. Lotsof long term people left like 10plus years in the company. Lots of a managers and associates let go or quit because of the new management.
good,Different departments make or break it. In the front end I was miserable but things were better in the pharmacy. Management changes often so its hard to say whether or not things will be the same or worse. Walmart doesnt seem to keep consitent policies so things can be confusing and frustating.
good,"there are no real benefits or downside to working here. although they general have awesome people working there, it has way too much drama to deal with"
good,"Walmart retail had an automotive addition that did basic car maintenance such as oil changes, battery jobs, and tire mounting and balancing. Also had sales dept."
good,"Advancement opportunities are good, but I feel at times it all about who you know. I enjoyed teaching and training new associates, but it never got recognized with senior management"
good,"It's good, people are great, environment is like every Walmart.  Can be stressful during busy hours depend how much can you take it.  Everything is depending on the store and managers.  Flexible schedule is good but the only bad part is that it's 3 weeks of schedule and you must really plan ahead.  Salary is OK for college and retirement or living in small city/town.  It's good for second job. Good opportunities to grow within the company if you want fulltime."
good,"A rapidly growing company having difficulty (locally) attracting and retaining good talent."
good,"Walmart's job culture is great in theory, but the reality of the situation is totally different. It feels like the management doesn't embrace the spirit that the rules and policies were based upon."
good,At times it was a very fast paced other times you had to find things like straightening candy racks or clothes or shelves. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the public and helping customers.
good,I worked for Walmart for 3 and half years. Difficult to advance in pay and positions depending on manager and current position. Sometimes treated unfairly or your message to managers isnt acknowledge.
good,"Staffs are usually polite. You can step away when you are available to without severe consequences, so that you can assist a customer in a different department. Managers do their best to assist their staffs so that their staffs can better assist customers."
good,no review no review no review no review Walmart is like any other company no better and not less.  I have nothing bad to say about Walmart.  Its not about where you work but how you work.
good,"Managers don't really communicate with each other. They'll have seven CSM's on the floor, and each one wants you to do something different. Of course, they don't tell each other when they've sent someone to go do something, so they'll start paging you on the intercom and telling people you've gone missing, when really you're doing what they told you to. I'm not the only one, either. Basically everyone I worked with agreed that this was the number one issue with working here."
good,I like being a cashier usually always busy i didn't like the management they dont do there jobs properly. They make you wait to long for overrides.  Alot of employees
good,"Causal wear, false promises. "
good,"I unloaded 18 wheeler trucks, sort merchandise, move merchandise to floor. Fast paced unloading trucks, cloths were usually soaked within 30 minutes. Trucks needed to be unloaded by lunch either one or two trailers. Immediate supervisors were great. co workers were awesome."
good,"Honestly I loved what I did at Walmart. I had a leadership role in the store and loved working with my team. I quite enjoyed the face to face interaction with my associates and customers. Fast paced and kept me moving on my feet. A couple things drove me away. One, the pay. Not quite enough to make a comfortable living. With that said when it came to yearly evaluations and the time for a raise, they cut corners to cut back on payroll as much as possible. I could have been the best employee in the history of Walmart and only ever was told and I quote ""this close to exceeds"" to get a raise. Two, was management. This was the biggest hitter to drive me away. The unrealistic expectations. The job I performed was online sales in store. It relied all departments of the store to have accurate on hands of merchandise and fully stocked shelves. That was never the case. I was expected to find and fix all missing merchandise and other department issues. They have department managers for that that would never be held accountable for their departments. I'd still be there if I feel like I was paid enough for the work I put in and was treated fairly."
good,"Provided support and training to merchandise team, suppliers, overseas partners, and support teams on company’s applications and general merchandise questions.  Ensured timely and accurate creation of purchase orders in order to meet production.  Tracked merchandise from origin to destinations and reported on any exceptions potentially not hitting event date."
good,They gave me free rein to clean wherever I wanted to as long as I wore a walkie just in case they needed me to clean something else up I loved making bales I'd offer to do it when other workers would see it needed done but hated doing it so they'd walk passed it
good,Management was horrible. They did not care if employees were trained like they needed to be. Can not get any help when you ask some. I was really disappointed
good,"departments have different roles so it is hard to give my opinion on the company as a whole, also depends on manager.Cashiering was bad, customers complain about everything but that is everywhere."
good,Walmart was a good job had its pros and cons . I enjoyed working with each person working with me. Certain managers were nice. My hours worked great we’re what i wanted them to be.
good,The workplace culture got worse over the years. It's all about production that most associations can't even make. They take everybody holidays. Its hard to work there.
good,Typical day of setting up the front-end. Assisting cashiers and customers. I enjoyed the front end help and the customers. Management overall was hard to work with .
good,aint really like it it was boring don't feel like walking around it was cold had to be outside reason why I quit pay wasn't that great to keep me in for all that I did
good,"I liked my job overall. I could do what they asked of me and much more. I felt there was a big lack of advancement there. The hours were always erotic and unreliable. The week bonuses were handed out they cut 500 hours from the store to make up for it. So that week employees went with severally reduced hours, some even had zero hours that week like me."
good,"My typical day consistent of getting into work early mornings to prepare the department for the following staff or coming into a mess already. It was said that our department was vital to Walmart, yet management would often take staff from our department for their own departments, yet leave only one or two staff to handle the department which actually was three departments in one. It was a struggle to keep up with the demand of customers and getting scolded by manager for not completing their own personal tasks. Other employees tended to lack motivation to work so it felt work wasn't getting done as well."
good,"buen trabajo, pero no tenia mas expectativas ni desarrollo profesional  ahí."
good,Long work hours with up to 12 weeks with no time off between back to school and black Friday then you are forced to work to cover peoples vacations who had seniority.
good,es una empresa donde el ambiente es muy tranquilo pero que requiere de mucho desgaste físico la cantidad de clientes que maneja.
good,"This is a good job with good benefits and good pay, however management  at certain locations only allow advancements to certain people regardless of qualifications."
good,"I loved working for Walmart, but did not like management. Management did not care that I was working and going to school. A typical work day is like any other retail store, busy. Especially around the holidays. The customers were really nice, but as always there were always a few rude customers. The benefits were pretty good and they had free lunches if the store reached its ""accident free"" goal."
good,It was a fun environment to work in was able the meet and greet all types of people. Great staff I work with until they started firing everybody that actually got the job done.
good,"Flexible hours are perfect, especially while going to school. They are able to work with everyone's availability. They also offer bonuses every quarter."
good,"every day was fast paced and full of lacking team members that didn't work at all and got others to do the work for them, overall there were days that were easy but majority of the days working there are hard and take a lot of people skills, and patience."
good,Walamart is a overall good place to work but does cause some stress being such a fast paced environment I enjoy my job here And would recommend it to others
good,empresa muito boa de se trabalhar. gerencia muito boa. boa gestao
good,"i got incredibly overpaid for what I was actually given autonomy to do.   great work life balance, and met a lot of great people.   I also met and worked with many people that made a signifigant amount of money, and were willing to do anything to protect their income.   The company did a lot of the right things, and was a good company to work for.    If not for overpaid leaders in the markets trying to make Walmart their own personal fiefdom, it would be one of the best places in the world to work."
good,Fluxo de trabalho intenso e com regras pré definidas. Contato direto com cliente ajuda a desenvolver muito as relações interpessoais e a empatia.
good,There is always something needing emergency help. There are too many managers having too many opinions. The employees for the most part are really great to work with but you will run into those that show up to work but don't intend on doing any work. Count on being the only person there to get anything done.
good,"A typical day at work is getting all the necessary tools that you need in order to do your job efficiently and effectively; scanner and printer."
good,its ok but if you can find better do so. They expect you to give up your life for them regardless of you having a family or not. They have taken a lot away from the old associates who have been with the company 5 years or more.
good,No maintenance crew. 3 people for the whole week. All full time 40 hours per week. Scheduled ONE BEST WAY is 38 hours a night or 4 employees not one or if lucky 2.
good,"Wasn't the best place to work, but it wasn't the worse. You'd never know what to expect on a given work day. One day would be great while the next would be a headache."
good,"Worked for neighborhood market deli, overall experience was okay. There were issues with department management, coverage (there were times I would have to hold down the entire deli/bakery alone or even close down all by myself.) and lack of teamwork during my stay there (fellow associates not cleaning up after themselves/ leaving dirty dishes, not cooperating with completing party orders, etc)"
good,Still not enough pay ! And is done unfairly ! They expect alot with not enough people and are slow to hire ! Still pay more than most places but dont adjust accordling
good,"Management was poor and my time there was short. Often understaffed, hectic, without enough hours. Everything is fixed including when we took breaks and how long regardless of how busy we were or if others needed help."
good,Managers don’t work with your schedule. Management don’t know how to lead a team always on their phones or go to other areas to just gossip. It’s real good pay
good,great for new learning high school graduates to start off at although the teamwork and communication between manager to employee could be improved. teamwork seemed to fade quickly once employee starts to exceed in expectations
good,The hardest part of the job is literally finding where everything goes and that’s it. All I did was stand around help a few customers clean up a spill etc. it’s not a hard job
good,The hours of working there are no set. The supervisor is very rude. They won't let you take time off for an family emergency. On the other hand the managers are nice and every understanding
good,"I worked as overnight maintenance for over 3 years, I learned a lot about keeping floors clean and refinishing floors but my experience with management there was not ideal no consistancy and unprofessional."
good,It is expected to encounter many personalities on the job but it is not expected that managers bully the staff and get away with it. Especially when you are an amazing worker and go above and beyond for everyone.
good,Physically demanding job but they are one of the only good paying jobs here.  Hours are very early but you get off at a decent hour and you either work a Tues-Friday Schedule 10 hrs a piece or Friday through Monday.
good,"Hours usually do not exceed 40 per week. Overall experience heavily depends on who your managers are. Flexible scheduling, however they really prefer open availability as well as people who can work early morning shifts and weekends. PTO (Paid Time Off) is accrued over time based on average weekly hours worked. Employees can buy company stock as well as have a 401k plan. Recent educational benefits were added through a company called Guild. If you are majoring in a Business degree then Wal-Mart will help you pay for college to an extent towards specific business degrees. It's $1 a day, or $365 per year, that you must contribute to this program if interested. Overall working here can be stressful especially when short staffed on weekends, but compared to other retail companies the pay is higher and it's not always stressful. It really depends on the scheduling and the day of the week. "
good,"Sometimes manager expectations are totally unrealistic. Seems like no matter how hard you work, it's never enough. Sometimes mangers allows their personal feelings to influence their professional decisions."
good,"While working at Wal-mart for the year that I did, I learned so much in my electronics department. I had one of the most knowledgeable Dept. Managers and most of my co-workers were well researched in the pros and cons of most of the products we carried."
good,"Truthfully, it depends on the management at the store. Each store is different. There can be a lot of management that simply see themselves as higher than the associates."
good,The typical day at work starts by punching in on the time clock. I learn to checkout groceries in a fast paced environment. The manager was not flexible with my schedule
good,"Management is unfair and do not care about associates, you get no holidays off. along with unfair hours and no overtime, also the management is trained to do whats best for financal gain"
good,"I worked for Walmart when it first came to Ukiah.  We were hyped and excited for all the potential.  It was the excitement of a game show, then the reality set in."
good,"ITs not a bad job but for what Walmart makes annually, they should pay more.  Its a good part time job or temp job but unless your in for the long haul, I don't recommend this job for long periods of time.  High turnover for associates as well as managers."
good,"As with retail and service industry based jobs, Walmart is a very fast paced job. As a department manager and even often working in claims there is more that needs to be done than there are hours in the day."
good,My job was being a stocker placing goods one the shelf to be claimed by customers but at the job it was not easy to do that management would say do one thing then another member of management would tell you to do something else then the employee receives briefing for what they thought was the right thing
good,"I was actually all around the store for customer service, overrides on the cash registers as well as doing audits, making sure the store was properly staffed for the day"
good,"A typical day is you arrive to your shift, help customers then hours in to your shift a lead or manager will give you some direction. Management is given very little wiggle room to operate with and has to make compromises."
good,"hours were ok and the workers were fun and enjoyable to be around. managers basically left you alone unless needed. pay was low, as were the raise opportunities."
good,It’s a good place to start a career. Become a family and build there are multiple places to move around and or move up from certain positions and different departments
good,Under paid for the amount of work. Minimum wage to work in hazardous areas where cars are constantly racing around you while your trying to do your job. Outside no matter the weather conditions. Left for days on end to work by myself for 6-7 hours a shift to do all the Carryouts & to keep the entire parking lot cleared because we only had an opening and closing courtesy clerk.
good,"Wal-Mart has all but lost the culture that Sam Walton  built the company on so many years ago. They focus on getting every ounce of productivity possible for the fewest hours and fewest people possible."
good,"Being a manager can be stressful and over whelming at times, but I enjoy working with people. I enjoy handling problems and answering phones. I enjoy counting money and solving customer issues."
good,It was ok not to fun but it paid alright I left to make more money but it’s a great start for kids  so idk welll see where it goes from here Sueces my
good,"Typical days included retrieving shopping carts from outside and bringing them inside. With the scheduling that corporate allowed i had very little help within my position. On weekends, I would often work my entire shift alone. This among other things, lead to complete burnout."
good,Não é ruim mais bom também não foi trabalhar lá. Não verdade teria que fazer algumas medidas de controle e fiscalização pra melhorar às coisas.
good,"I worked mornings as Dairy Mngr., mixed shifts in other positions."
good,"not for everyone, not exactly what i had in mind. customers were fine. The management didn't really aid everyone. i had to work shift i was not scheduled for and it was just rough trying to make time for the family"
good,"Intense manual labor is an understatement. You are in a trailer loading freight for twelve hours a day and maybe more during the holiday season. You work either a 3 day schedule or 4 day schedule. The average freight for a day is around 6,000 to as much as 8,500 per lane a shift and the weight of each box can be from 1 lb up to 150 lbs. The average box weight is around 30 lbs and will break you until you become used to it. There is no air conditioning in the warehouse and Florida temperatures in the warehouse exceed humane conditions. During the summer they provide water bottles but starting in October, they take the water away and you have to bring your own water. They do have fountains to fill up your bottles or jugs but they are disgusting due to the dust flying everywhere in the warehouse. While the manual labor is intense, the pay and schedule is fair. Maxed out worker makes $20.60 an hour. Perfect for a college student and there is many of us."
good,we received a truck that had produce on it. I had to break down the pallets and scan the produce to see if it  needed to go out on the floor or in the cooler.
good,I didn't enjoy working here because of all the changes in management and with the company. I left for another company that offered better work environments and packages.
good,I loved my job and work my tail off for my job but poor management can make it all turn out to be a horrible place to work. I’ve been at WalMart for 3 years and a Dept. Manager for 2 years
good,"A typical day in Walmart was random at best. For me as a Garden center associate I could be working in Garden center, or literally any other department. Most of my time was spent working in the automotive and hardware departments. Mostly because the previous associate was terminated. My jobs when I was in Garden center ranged from Zoning, which was pulling items forward and making the aisles look good. I also stocked and took care of re-shops. Other jobs in Garden could have been assisting customers on the cash register or unlocking grill and lawnmowers after the customer purchased them, then helping the customers load them into there vehicle. I also stocked and zoned the dirt and mulch, then I helped the customers load purchased dirt and mulch into there vehicles. I sometimes had to come in early around 5 am to water the flowers. And some times start my shifts at 10 at night because I wanted to help out with department mods. Mods are how the aisles are set up from the shelving to the product, and prices. Me and a team of other associates had to set up the new mods. From taking down the original shelving units and items to setting up the new shelving units and placing the items in there new homes then pricing them. Other jobs I did in Walmart were running a cash register in the front of the store. I did stockmen/cart pusher work and helped out in any department that needed assistance that day. When I wasent working in garden center I took care of the hardware and automotive departments. I mostly zoned and took care of re-shops. I also assisted at the paint counter and in sporting"
good,"Management at Walmart is horrible. The higher ups always tell you to do their job, and complain when you’ve been busy working and they sit back on butts doing nothing. You can usually catch them in the back on they’re phones and making excuses for there favorite workers."
good,"Management was stale, and mainly focused on their own jobs rather than helping associates or customers. Coworkers are amazing well rounded people. Customers were always lovely."
good,"Though management and associate don’t always see eye to eye, there’s a sense of brotherhood that sets in a few months to a year into employment. In my personal experience, I have become friends with several of my fellow associates, and will most likely continue being friends. However, on a professional basis, it seems to me that Walmart has difficulty with supplying their employees with equipment to expedite work, the infrastructure for said equipment is unstable, and I have witnessed and received verbal warnings for failing to complete a task due to a lack of equipment/equipment failure."
good,"Very high expectations of cap 2 team, coupled with understaffing and disconnected management. Extremely poor communication, misinformation, unprofessional behavior and practices"
good,lately short staffed and very busy. hardest part of the job is not having enough help most enjoyable part of my job is my co workers and customers.management is okay
good,"A typical day as a member of management is very busy, taking care of Associates needs, customer needs, store mgr notes, unloading and finalizing trucks."
good,"Most days were okay; dealt with difficult weather at times; some managers were okay; some coworkers, okay; mostly just focused on the job and let everything else take care of itself."
good,"Employees tend to not be noticed by management and while some employees work non-stop, others sit around and do nothing and management does not seem to care."
good,I loved my time with Walmart Meetings and charities and we all worked as a team had room to grow within the company but when push came to shove their bottom line counted more then employees
good,"New managers always coming and going,no body cares how proficent your are at your job, management aims to write you up at any moment. takes forever to advance because of walmart academy and out sourcing from other stores"
good,"My experience working with Walmart has been one of seeming stagnation and repetition of challenges. The people I've worked along side have been, for the most part, great colleagues and good friends. However, I've witnessed and worked through trying situations that could have been prevented, and a number of issues that have come up are poorly taken care of. I should also state that while its good enough to make ends meet, there is a fair amount of stress to be had, and very little incentive to pursue advancement, as the costs do not seem to outweigh the benefits."
good,"Overnight stocking is very rough. Not even your best work is enough. I imagine the place could flow well with enough staff, but they can't hold onto staff because the entire shift constantly feels mistreated by management. People get fed up and walk out, leaving the remaining staff under more pressure to get the work done. NEVER WORK SEASONAL."
good,This job is do able as long as you can handle the way they abuse your work hours as well as drama associated with walmart itself. The 11 dllars an hour does however help to motivate you to stay.
good,"the management when i worked there was very unprofessional and very cutthroat it was a huge reason why i wasnt to fond of the job, other than managment i really had no problems"
good,I liked working there but I didn’t make enough money. .. everyone was really nice but I didn’t feel like I fit in as an employee. I really needed more money being a single mom of three little boys.
good,"In my opinion, in leesville the store was relatively clean and well managed. The store in Valdosta I worked at was dismal and very condescending in that management micromanaged at a clip of unstopping monotony.  The store itself was very dirty and terribly miscared for. No one there seemed to be willing to work throughout the shift and the ones who did were reprimanded and mistreated. In short the staff was short shrift and very menacing. However the ones who pulled their weight made the store very approachable. The management I saw and worked with were terrible. I need not say more about that."
good,"Good place to work, Management needs alot of work. They have no people skills. I worked for Walmart in Colorado, managment was great. Management in Painted post NY need alot more training"
good,if you aren't apart of the cool kids no matter how hard you work you won't advance. Even if you keep your head down someone has something to say about everyone. there was too much high school drama working here.
good,"The culture is not the same that it started w/ "
good,Too many managers with lack of communication. Not very understanding for everyday family matters. Too big a company to care for their employees. Can be ok if only in 1 department with 1 manager
good,"I worked at Walmart straight out of high school out of necessity. Not entirely a bad place to work at but definitely not worth the pay. I’m sure now it’s different but always under staffed, picking up others work and underpaid lead to me applying to the Border Patrol for a stable career"
good,"Decent place to work. Very labor intensive. Learned how to push myself past my limits as we needed energy for a 9 hour shift consisting of heavy labor. Culture is okay, meetings before every shift to boost morale which is good, sometimes with treats. Hard part is if someone is slacking, everyone stays until job is done, which at the end of the day can be very frustrating. The good part is the seasonal events and the employee lobby with a TV."
good,"They pay you to abuse you. 12+ hour work days, 6+ work week, innovated but constant change, do more with less everyday. No work life balance. Not consistent direction from upper management."
good,"Not really a job you would want to have for a long time, unless you can become a manager. I became a pharmacy assistant because of prior experience, but cashiering before that was absolutely miserable. The customers treat you like garbage, management doesn't care, and any slip up and they give you an un-friendly, and usually unprofessional ""talking to"" followed by a warning."
good,"The job is exactly as stated.  You clock in, deal with customers all day, then leave.  There are very few surprises.  I enjoy a fast paced busy environment.  I enjoy helping customers meet their needs.  I never figured out the trick to get ahead unfortunately.  I am one of many underutilized and underappreciated associates.  I stay for the benefits, for now."
good,Would be a good place to work if employees couuld get more hours in and the turn over rate wouldn't be so bad. People calling out also put an extra load on the employees that do come in only to have to work that much harder!!!
good,Never saw the manger of my department. Wasn't clear on what to do on a daily basis. Trading was not what you expect. Sitting on a computer all day. Liked that we get an hour lunch.
good,"Pleasant work culture, co-workers had a good attitude.  The hours were not suitable for me - evenings and weekends. I wanted to be full-time but was never offered the opportunity"
good,"Up until recently I have mostly enjoyed my time at Walmart.  Their starting pay is above average for this area.  However they are expecting a lot more out of all their employees, without added pay."
good,"It was ok, Just no way of growing advancing into the roles to grow and become more in the company .I  did enjoy my time there . I enjoyed the people I met and got to know."
good,Fast-paced sales environment.   Most customers are very kind and courteous. I have had the expanded opportunity of providing greater customer service.
good,"I feel like I was tricked into taking a promotion. When I voiced my concern about not being ready for the promotion the previous DM told me I knew what I needed to know to do the job. She was wrong, and after she left I realized that I knew nothing. It felt like everyday I leaned I was doing something wrong, or not doing a task was supposed to be doing. The store manager doesn't care at all about the fresh departments."
good,its A great place to work for and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a job it’s just I got burned out with and decided to quit  but overall it’s a great company
good,"working at walmart is a good job if your a school student just looking for a pay check. its not very good if you have a family to take care of. no long working there because I got sick and they wouldn't except my doctors note, so they let me go"
good,"I liked working at walmart for the first 2 years I worked here, but now the management has gotten worse, no more overtime is allowed, we are constantly losing workers which makes the job harder to do with less people. The store manager doesn't really care about anything that happens so nothing ever gets fixed and there is no communication between shifts so people are always confused on what has been done on previous shift."
good,"Learned a lot about customer service and the ways to help individual consumers with sales. "
good,I was at retirement age and my job was discontinued. So I would have to take another job of less pay. But since I was retiring I was not offered another job to continue my service at walmart.
good,"I've worked at Walmart for about five months and sadly, they cut my hours. This is the reason I am choosing to leave. I was working around twenty hours per week and suddenly my hours were cut to four or less per week. I was then told I couldn't have more hours because there were no more and they needed to give hours for their full time employees more..."
good,They don’t pay enough for what they expect from you take advantage of their employees I have worked there for 10 years and make as much as the person coming off the street
good,Walmart is a good working environment for smiling faces and great benefits for associates to team on certain projects and communicate with others. Decent hours can be made but not enough yo pay gor living arrangements.
good,"Each place has its ups and downs, but I have no bad feelings towards working at Walmart. It was probably time to go down a new road for myself. It was probably destined for me to end up somewhere else, better even."
good,When working for Walmart you got to go work do what you need to do and clock out when it’s your time for dismissal.Never disagree with the customer because that’s bad customer ervice whether they wrong or not
good,"Walmart is good place to start working in United States. They don't need experience and any specific qualification (minimum qualification is Highschool graduate). "
good,It was a job where the work pace varied and you had to be ready for anything to change at a moments notice. what you do to who you are helping changes all the time.
good,Buen ambiente laboral sin posibilidad de turnos fijos
good,"Working at Walmart is okay at best, the management wasnt the best, we are currently understaffed in every department. Due to company policy we can't hire new employees. Due to this, employees are always stressed out, as they are doing twice the work to keep this store running. The pay is okay, the employees very from person to person, I've made great friends here. If you really need a stable job and fast, I'd recommend working here. But keep an eye out for something better, or try to move up."
good,Family friendly business and great teamwork experience with employees.also great staff that worked hard.great boss that helped staff with and helped with work
good,Es una empresa que tiene como propósito tener consumidores con su extención de catálogo de proveedores. Y su inovación con cada temporada del año tratando de enfocar sus ventas en consumir sus productos a un bajo costó en cada uno de sus diferentes departamentos abarrotes químicos papelería electrónica farmacia y ropa
good,"Typical day was stocking shelf and assisting customers with finding merchandise"
good,Managers were always around to help if you needed anything or had any questions about anything. The employees were always able to help with anything you might need or help you find something for a customer.
good,Stressful work days...I learned customer service...poor management...workplace culture is stressful...hardest part of the job us completing a daily overload of work...most enjoyable part was the regular associates and customers
good,"I found walmart or rather some of the department mangers difficult to get along with. we were told to do one thing then would be in trouble for doing what we were told."
good,"Morale is low at the store I work at because there is a significant lack of staff, and people willing to work.  It makes it hard to want to go into work each day.  I used to love working here but the management team expect far too much from people who currently work there."
good,"Es una empresa en lo general muy buena, gasta millones de pesos por promover al personal y fomentar los valores de la cultura walmart. Desafortunadamente algunos de sus lideres y gerentes de sucursales son lo mas nefasto del mundo y hacen que el trabajo sea totalmente indeseable."
good,"The job working there was one of the easiest i've ever worked before, one of my first jobs that i've had was working at a Walmart in Kansas. When i worked there unloading as cap 2, the job was fun and I loved coming into work as much as any employee but working at the Walmart close to where i live now was horrible."
good,"Customer services- exchanges, returns,cashes checks, send money, money orders, go back's, stocking cashiering, meeting new people, seal credit cards.."
good,"Cashier"
good,Multiple tasks are given and times they have to be done in. Fellow associates fall behind and you have to finish your tasks quicker to help that other associate. Management plays favorites so if you're not one you are worked harder.
good,I advanced very quickly at Walmart. it is a decent company to work for. I don't necessarily like how some of the managers treat employees but its nothing too bad.
good,I worked for 6 years in a standard retail environment.  Held multiple positions from entry level stock person to department manager.  Health benefits offered but very expensive.
good,"Every night, I arrive to listen to a meeting, check my task, and proceed to so assigned task. Task times vary for each aisle, but overall, they're very small, and never flexible. Even after comparing freight size and task time, they don't care. Only enjoyable part of the job is when it gets quiet at times."
good,I enjoyed working here because the time when by great while i worked. It was fast paced. The benefits where great. The extra discounts you get where great
good,"I enjoyed the time I worked at walmart. I had a very good boss, and the people I worked with were great too. I only left because of the low pay and benefits."
good,"I was a cashier their, very tight schedule, when I applied to go to school, they wouldn't help with work schedule so I could do both. With this I had to quit the job to go to school."
good,Walmart is a place if you just getting out of high school and you want your first job improvise good benefits work hours is okay if you like working long work hours stressful not a place for if you have a family to raise underpaid employees very stressed out employees if you want to learn how to multitask Walmart is a good place to work if your dad just to get by in life good place what if you trying to grow and become something not a good place will hold you back from growing for succeeding in life reaching those goals that you want to reach real hard to advance to go up the chain the latter as I say but if you just looking for a job go work at Walmart and you looking for a part-time job or work at Walmart and we looking for a career go somewhere else thank you and have a nice day
good,Good company no union so open door policy is handles at store level. Long hours and work weeks. On call. Process drivin. Making sure you follow the process per the company standards.
good,"My experience with Walmart has been mediocre. The job itself is alright, but it's honestly basically just a starting job. The wage doesn't cover living expenses at all, especially part time. Luckily, I didn't have to cover those, as I'm currently attending college and am simply saving on the side, but that issue still held for a lot of my coworkers. The management was alright when I got there, but as time went on, it slowly got worse with every promotion. And over time, I grew sick of working there. They expect the world out of your time(which is expected at work, of course, but they expected the WORLD of your time). And eventually, the work just grew monotonous and exhausting."
good,"the workloads no matter the situation seem to be never ending, like your work is never finished, not only that the work itself seems to be passed from one person to another until it is finally resolved, then starts again"
good,"The position was okay for the pay, and they work well with your availability while you're in school. However they hardly ever take your side when it comes to issues with patients and do not take experience into consideration when scheduling and assigning tasks."
good,"Until about six or seven months ago I honestly enjoyed my job. It seems as if in recent days there seems to be less employees but the same amount of work if not more. A typical day at work consists of our Management Team expecting us to be able to pick up the slack of an entire store instead of understanding that we have very limited resources and we're doing our best. So Instead of trying to fix the problem of the lack of employees they pick and choose who they'd like to hold accountable for problems they have no solutions to. When it comes to our Support or Assistant Managers, the only time they get held accountable is when they make our store manager look bad. This past 2018 I have had multiple Sales Floor Associates and Cashiers tell me that they've gone to not only our Store Manager but Corporate and I still have yet to see our upper management be held accountable for their job performance or lack there of."
good,"The company for the most part is the same as most large retail chains. Stressful environment with little recognition unless you put yourself out there for management, regardless of the amount of work performed. Promotions more often occurred without interviews, instead going to an individual pre-selected by management. Often, more qualified applicants were not considered due to manager preference many times based on the personal rapport with the decision maker. Turnover among salary management was high as well, resulting in associates needing to adjust to a new style every few months or so. Toward the end of my time there it was admittedly getting better but by then many of those I had worked with the entire time I worked there had already become unsatisfied with their careers, including several of the salary managers."
good,"Management is scared to hold people accountable for their actions, or inactions, that hinders the store as a whole. They need to stand firm with everyone on an equal level, and not let one get away with murder while jumping down another's throat for the smallest of hiccups. Also, they need to have an alternative planned out when they forbid a plan of action that has been in place up until the point that employees are told to stop. You can't just say, ""Hey you can't do it this way anymore."", without a another way of handling the issues that will arise. You pretty much leave them in-between a rock and a hard place. Also, you can't get mad at the outcome because employees take initiative to come up with a solution when you didn't have one in place already."
good,Wal-Mart gives you a very specific routine to follow. You will learn the different position you are put in and are usually cross trained to other positions as well. The hourly associates are kind and care for one another. The major down side is the management can over micro manage but will ask if there are any problems. The hardest part of the job is when one routine fails then all the others do as well. I have personally enjoyed the co workers and getting to know them.
good,It is very stressfulsometimes  but I do like it here. Management is nice. It’s a good job for a persons first job as well. But a little overwhelming at times.
good,"A typical day was ever changing."
good,Pretty much a run of the mill job. Employees received a good wage for the amount of work you performed. Management at my former Walmart was pretty bad. Made me leave the store.
good,"My co-workers are amazing people.  I truly enjoy working with them.  Our management team is nice and fairly easy to work with, but they are seldom (if ever) on the same page.  Paid time off and sick pay are earned based on hours worked.  Most of us feel that we are a part of a team, though we are usually understaffed.  The hardest part of my job is making customers wait for management.  I've seen customers have to wait 20 minutes or more to speak to a member of management.  The best part of my job is my co-workers."
good,Working at Walmart is for the most part a good job the people I work with are amazing we have a lot of fun but we also get the job done. Overall Walmart is a good job to start out with
good,A typical day at Walmart in my department starts by unloading a truck. Depending on the day you might be yelled out or being ordered by a manager who isnt in charged of truck unloading. If you can handle the managers the rest is a fun experience where you work with interesting coworkers and given an hour lunch.
good,"They tried to be supportive but there is barely shielded favoritism when it comes to recognition.  There is a sense of team spirit when working there but its not really solid.  Its a big store, with a high turn over rate so it I kinda felt like you never really got to know anyone before they left.   Management at the time was kinda stiff, didn't really commit to maintaining or fostering team spirit.  Everyone did work hard but they worked hard on their own.  It was more sink or swim; it was okay until the holidays came and then most people just drowned."
good,It's an ok job. Management was generally nice but also inept at their job which made it straining for the regular associates. I guess the best part about Walmart but also it's biggest flaw is that Walmart will pretty much hire anyone. So your co-workers will be the luck of the draw. Also Walmart generally won't fire people no matter how bad they are at their jobs. They'll most likely only fire people for gross misconduct or attendance. So if you want a job that will be easy to keep but don't mind the stress/low pay then Walmart is the job for you.
good,"I started out working in Bastrop, Texas, great people, fun, worked together as a team.  Then transferred to store in Oklahoma City.  This store was in high crime area and you dealt with some drug customers. Made me scared.  People did not work together as a team."
good,A typical day is fast paced always busy. I learning to be a cashier and about customer service. I would say management is iffy depending who you worked with. workplace culture is not bad but can be stressful depending on customers.  the hardest part in dealing with customers. most enjoyable is meeting new people.
good,Walmart is an okay company would not recommend for long term employment. If they know that you're a good worker it will be used against you as they will pull you to different departments expecting you to magically get all the returns done. Some of the managers are great but that's not saying much as the overbearing ones far out number them.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was not bad i got along with my co-workers and the job it self was simple but it was not ran properly by management and they inefficient with time,employees,hours scheduled. I wouldn't mind working for Wal-Mart again just not overnight."
good,I'd come in either at 6 in the morning or around noon. I'd check in and either go straight to a checkout lane or to an aisle to do so stocking. It was new at the time so no one was burnt out and management was very good and attentive.
good,Walmart was okay as ajob it just wasn't for me pretty fast paced and not super flexible on the hours like you could only have 6 points and even if you needed off for an emergency it would cost you 3 points. Plus it's Walmart....
good,"I love 90%of working for this company. The stocking, sales floor, and cashier teams are impeccable. Unfortunately, because of the extreme corporate atmosphere of the company,  many managers know eachother from previous locations. There is a huge problem with favoritism and retaliation in this specific store, which prevents the hardest working individuals from ever advancing their positions."
good,"my normal everyday at work is just full of stress but i learned to love the challenge and ask more questions, the managment never listen or consider my opinion or my complains regarding the work issues, the unrealistic expactations is the hardest part, what i enjoy is the good people who work with together as a team and being a problem solver sometims"
good,You work your back out. For the same pay as associates that do nothing but zone all day you never get your breaks on time. Sometimes you go 7 hours without your lunch never go to lunch on Scheduled time.
good,Managers put a reputation on me and started harassing me by making me do other people's work and telling me how my jobs weren't good enough. Store manager would write me up for the jobs that I did but weren't good enough. Also had favorites in terms of co-workers.
good,The place isn’t a bad place to work it’s jusr short handed and I’ve been there 4 years and I’m ready for more money this is why im looking for a second job
good,"Poor work life balance"
good,"I never regret my experience with the companies I have been with but Walmart did not have the growth or development I was looking to achieve. They did not have a good work life balance and I spent far too much time away from my family. I did not feel I"
good,"I feel like i went above and beyond for walmart, worked wenever wherever they needed me anytime and feel like towards the end i got treated wrong...i wasnt provided with any documents that i askes for"
good,"Working here at walmart is fine it gets stressful at times,but all jobs are. Just tired of getting in trouble for little things or things that arn't true."
good,"The chain of command sucked. when asking questions would never get a strait answer. They were good about giving time off if we "
good,"Does this job really need a review? its Wal-mart. It's exactly what you would expect. You get paid just enough to get by and work accordingly. as long as you dont steal, you probably wont get fired."
good,Great benefits but poor working conditions and pay. not given sufficient hours to receive adequate pay to survive with a family. I would not recommend it to anyone with a family to support as a main job.
good,Was a great company but times are changing and no longer as family oriented. Don't agree with all the new changes. Would not recommend to a long term potential employee.
good,The best part of the job was interacting with the customers throughout the day. Learned a lot from talking with them about their melds lifestyle and everyday activities. The hardest part was trying to balance upper management with the every day tasks of taking care of your customers.
good,"Management sucks but the other associates make it somewhat enjoyable.  Management doesn't follow company plan but expects everyone else to know and implement it, so there's always butting heads."
good,"I ended up resigning from Walmart due to family issues beyond my control, I would definitely reapply. Working in the cold is great for a hot natured person but can take a toll on you as the years go by."
good,"Walmart asks a lot from its employees. I don't know of anyone that I worked with that wasn't overworked. That is not to say that you can't make a decent life from working there, and there are people I worked with that I will always appreciate."
good,"Walmart is not a good job to work for some people I say it’s not a good job because they always out of order, Customers are very Rude at times Walmart pay good but it’s just not for everyone."
good,"Working here as a maintenance employee wasn't a bad job. Sure, fixing everything that broke and cleaning up every mess that was made become a bit tedious, but most of the people I worked with were good people. My problem was with the management; A lack of clear communication, contradictory directions, and constant punitive action for minor or false nonsense was unbearable."
good,"I really do not want to bash Walmart as a whole, my store particularly had a lot of hard working and kind associates, but the management culture was to pick a few favorites, and advance them, leaving others to stay associates.  Accounting a time for example when 3 different associates with 3 or more years of experience were in line for the produce management position, someone was hired in with NO experience in retail what-so-ever to be department manager because of an agreement with upper management.  I know this is anecdotal, but it was one of the first nails in the coffin for me at Walmart, I knew at that point advancement probably wasn't an option."
good,The Job itself is really good. They have poor management. Pay is great the benefits are good. The hours are good. The hours can be flexible. Communication between management is poor.
good,"Enjoyed meeting of customers. At the door creator I enjoyed working in the jewelry department once again the meeting of customer"
good,"A lot of customer service interaction, busy maintaining the department, and training deadlines, the hardest part of the job was cleaning, the most enjoyable was interacting with customers."
good,The benefits are amazing but it’s like management doesn’t give you the option to promote unless they like you or you know someone. I have been here longer than others and make less and haven’t been promoted like others.
good,Not the best place to work at but overall it can be an okay place to work and grow. But I believe advancement is very slim and hard to obtain at this company and in my case can be subjected to only favorites.
good,"I pretty much just did what was asked of me, put things where they needed to go, and I think that I would have continued working there had I not had issues at home."
good,"Nothing to say. It was drama and a stressful environment overall. Although, I had a pretty laid back job, the coworkers never picked up their slack. I always got a maximum of 36 hours, which is not enough for my responsibilities and bills."
good,"Es una empres buena pero si ven mucho de ti, entonces no te apoyan"
good,"working at Walmart was pretty soul crushing, guest of Walmart typically treat the employees like garbage. that was definitely the hardest part of working there. management is not very helpful when it came to customer complaints"
good,"Walmart is a good place to start out but not a place to stay at permanently. When I first started at Walmart, it was a wonderful place to work at, bu when management changed it quickly went downhill."
good,Everyone always helped each other out and it helps to get some work done. Supervisors and Management were always supportive and try their best to help with scheduling.
good,"If you walk in to Walmart with the lowest expectations possible, you'll probably be fine. Any task you are assigned could be done by a monkey and you get paid a decent amount for it. It gets extremely repetitive, but a paycheck is a paycheck. You shouldn't expect to get a management position unless you're applying to literally every opening within the state. Management positions are extremely competitive, and if a manager within your store has any sort of negative bias of you I guarantee you will not get the advancement. I applied for a Customer Service Manager position earlier this year. I passed the test, and fully applied for the position. At that point I am supposed to get an interview. However, I learned by word of mouth that my manager wasn't going to interview me for the position despite being qualified and often being recognized as one of the harder workers within the store. You will probably enjoy your work more if you just do your tasks and not step out of line."
good,Walmart  is a good place to start off there if you’re wanting a first job. The pay is good .  It is a fast pace kind of job .  I want that some people will not always be the nicest to you .
good,"The job was fantastic, active, fast paced. Made the time go by very quickly but people are put into management positions and not made clear of what and who they are managing and what their employees are supposed to do every shift."
good,"Over the years, the management of Walmart has changed.  The company does not seem to hold the same values it once did.  Decisions are often handed down without input from those who perform the jobs and within months, those changes are taken back."
good,"Motivation and determination goes far in any company, I went from Cashier, to electronics associate, to Customer Service Manager all within a year. Don't let a job work you. Work the job."
good,"overall very poor management. Equipment is old to the point of almost not usable. Unless you get hired at a brand new store, don't expect much. Managers most are moved up through the ranks with little knowledge but time put in only. Offer little or no training."
good,Starting pay is higher than minimum wage.  They offer benefits to both full and part-time associates.  PTO earn by the years of service.  Management is ok
good,I like my job unloading and stocking but to many times it only matters when a manager says something no overtime what's so ever will not give full-time and very demanding management
good,Everyday i went in broke down pallets and worked all freight. for me being a strong stocker management gets upset with me for other departments not being done when im only in charge of one.
good,The field needs to practice respect for the individual. You must be a self starter and basically train yourself through online apps walmart offers. The new third party test program is rough.  You are basically alone at night supervising individuals who do not work for the company. Most do not care. You are expected to sometimes do the impossible.  Work life balance is not what it used to be. It can be rewarding at times. You have to learn to keep positive even when things go negative.
good,"Working in the Deli and closing was hard physical work.  I went home at night, shaped like a pretzel...had a hard time straightening up.  It was so physically demanding for an older person like me to do with all the cleaning and mopping at the day's end.  But I imagine a younger person would have no problem with the position at all."
good,"always busy,always something to do"
good,"Unloading trucks,putting away stock,pack out,cleaning up after those who didn't work. "
good,"Very Busy environment, co-workers are awesome, managers are demanding on getting things done the correct way, get the job done before you go home, lots to learn."
good,Working at wal-mart is what you expect to find at a retail store with average pay and average hours and with a constant influx of new workers and management with various types of competency and varying degree's of customers. Overall a good learning experience and an excellent place to develop social skills.
good,"Working at Wal-mart did provide a solid exposure to the diversity of people in the workplace and in dealings with the public. The hardest part of this job, was the constant changing of policies. The most important lesson was being able to change with the changing policies. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the public. Being able to assist them with a smile and being able to use my skills learned. The workplace culture is what is made. One can be sour or sweet. It depends on the flexibility and adaptability of the person. Adaptability and flexibility is a much needed component when working any job, including with management and workers and the public."
good,"I love this job, but were im headed its not a benefit. I want to gain more skills and Wal-Mart don't really have the skills I need to gain. It did help with my customer service skills."
good,Always short staffed which means management will pull anyone to fill the sections that don't have anyone to work. People constantly call in and there are no repercussions. The employee is not aware of the department that they have been assigned to which does not make a happy experience for the customer.
good,"I learned quickly that you are on your own after your 90 days are up."
good,Work with people that did not speak English.Many are watching you as you worked.Breaks were short and lunch was also. Management did not bother me.other employees would be looking at you and your work.
good,Overall did not enjoy my time with Walmart. Enjoyed working with fellow employees and custoimers but management would promise things and not deliver. Very inconsistent and paranoid being critical on smallest items yet seeming totally oblivious to the big picture of their employees and their needs.
good,non stop with not enough employees. I learned how to bake donuts and bread slice deli meats and work the hot bar. Management was very tough. The culture was stressful. the hardest part was clocking in The most enjoyable part going home
good,Waiting on customers and stocking shelves. Walmart is normally very busy so you have to always be on your toes and be able to work in a fast paced environment.
good,Being a personal shopper is not what you see on TV its fast pace. But once you get a good group that work good to gather It's fine a lot of standing on concrete bad for your feet and legs; A lot of cold day  standing between the freezer and the refrigerator and wet trip out side to customer cars.
good,"Work to life ratio was very easy, and if you needed time off, it wasn't too hard to get. But some of the management in there took their jobs to the max and thought they were better than everyone else."
good,I would go see what line they wanted me on then I got my till and want to my line and started checking customers out.  I did not like how we was treated by mangement they was rude and some of the was very lazy.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was stressful and long. The customers were not the problem, it's the employees. They didn't come to work to work instead they would depend on your labor to get through the day. Management has their picks  on who they will allow passes and it's really poorly managed. That is the main issue I had with Wal-Mart."
good,"It all depended on the area that you work, some areas were fun and enjoyable. Then there were other areas that were horrible. However when there is a bad management it makes the work experience bad."
good,They dont listen to both sides of the story and when you bust your but to do your job they keep the one that dont do anything they pick favorites and it's not fair
good,"I have been there for two years as of yesterday and I have been overlooked for several advancements even though I currently perform several tasks that are reserved for management, I have also been coached or spoken to several times for performing management tasks; even though my manager continues to ask me to perform them."
good,"great customers and fun co workers. I learned to deal with rude customers and help customers in need. I love helping the disabled, because I went beyond the call of duty to help them and experienced positive feedback."
good,This place is like any other retailers they are fast paced and will work you to the bone they don't have any patience for absences I did like working for them
good,The coworkers were nice. The management was bad. Typical Job. I learned how to use a cash register. hardest part was when you are short staffed and it is busy. i enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,"Working as a cashier at Wal-mart was fun,I learned how to operate new cash registers and to assist customers.which was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Since Walmart has undergone corporate changes, new rules and regulations have been put in place more so to help the customer while down playing what has made the company successful; the employee."
good,"A typical day involves doing your duties based off your position, helping customers, and supporting where you are needed. You get two fifteen minute breaks and a 30-60 minute lunch every day. As for management, it was shoddy at best. Nobody listened to each other, and once you had an issue with them, they didn't help you. The other employees are fine, and the work isn't too hard once you get used to it."
good,"Walmart isn’t a terrible place to work. Yes, you’re on your feet a lot and yes, you will get customers that seem like nothing you do will make them happy, but that is the nature of customer service based jobs like this. I think the only issue I may have had at one point was just not being backed up by my manager when I was doing most of the work while the other two employees I worked with were often nowhere to be found. Other than that, it wasn’t bad."
good,"Good place to gather experience in a place that you can learn about marketing and sales, customer services as well and how to follow procedures that can achieve goals."
good,"I think they should cut it down to 8 or 8.5 hours a day instead of a mandatory 9."
good,"Walmart is a great job if you want to live a mediocre life. They are terrible for cutting hours, and punishment for overtime, even if you had no choice but to stay over. You are expected to get a large amount done in a short time on some days, while other days you are bored out of your mind. I would not recommend the job to anyone."
good,management could be improved and more open minded to suggestions.  Management could be more understanding but good insurance.  The new system is horrible when it comes to the scheduling however it is Walmart.
good,Walmart is always growing and changing it's become very demanding with programs. High demand on getting programs right or job is on the line. However there are some good stores and teams out there. This particular store was ill managed by its Store Manager
good,"I was working as a remodel associate so it was different if working as a cashier.  I didn't enjoy it as much because of the work environment which wasn't as encouraging.  Some people were nice, but everyone seem to not be as helpful.  I learned how to do couple things, but mostly basic things like putting on shelves and fixtures."
good,"This job was perfect for me during school as I was able to working evenings and on the weekends. Workday can be slow or quick paced  depending on the amount of customers. Hardest part of the job is standing all day, as a cashier, and having to deal with unpleasant customers at times. My CSMs really dependable and I can go to them with any problems that I have. I enjoy the pleasant customers and my favorite coworkers when we are scheduled on the same shift. Great as a part time job, it pays the bills, but due to hours being cut at times, another job or two will be needed to support yourself. It's a straightforward job, I complete the same task almost everyday. Overtime not allowed, can be scheduled 30 hours one week and be scheduled 20 hours the next."
good,Too much to get done in a day and no one to help get it done. Lack of management engagement and held accountable for lack of stockers to get your department worked.
good,I loved my co-workers but walmart was hard to work for because the pay was low ($7.25 to $9.00 over a three year span) and they didn't seem to want the advancement of their employees. This could've just been my experience with the company based on the location I worked but that was my interpretation.
good,"It was a very stressful environment. They have very poor management Between the customers to the management, i believe walmart can treat their employees better."
good,It's a good place to work if you like fast paced work. You get to meet new people. And overall the co-workers were friendly. Management were willing to work with me on my hours.
good,"Each day can be incredibly stressful, or peaceful, depending on the management. My store rarely had enough employees, so each worker had to do more work than what they should have. There are good and bad days, and there is no telling which one you will walk into on a daily basis. Hit or miss."
good,Es tranquila pero los jefes inmediatos toman personalmente algunas cosas y existen sierras preferencias eso hace que no todos tengan las mismas oportunidades y desmotiva a los compañeros
good,"If your good at cashiering and working in different departments to keep busy, that will keep you sane. But most coworkers do little to nothing so that makes it hard for the people who do come to work to work."
good,"It was an alright place to work pretty strict attendance policy though and management is rude, There is an hour lunch though. The work pace changes per season."
good,"A typical day for me as an electronics associate included: stocking up merchandise in isles, maintaining cleanliness of my department, cashing out customers, processing photo orders, updating the movie MODS, selling Walmart Mastercards and grabbing the carts from outside when needed. Overall, a place to work for a student just to gather up some pocket change and gain some customer service experience."
good,This job is good to have if you enjoy hard work with no family  time.  Also seems like the supervisors on all levels have no clue what is going to happen next.
good,I didn’t like working here at this place they took you for granted and pushed you to work wit no breaks or lunch breaks and didn’t pay right I didn’t like it
good,As cashier stressful to deal with customers and the work itself can shift from being slow to very busy rapidly. Hard to become a full-time employee and get higher positions.
good,"A fast pace pharmacy, but a pleasant environment to work in. The hardest part of the job was working short staffed some of the time, but the pharmacy had a great computer system to work with. The best part of the job was getting to interact with customers."
good,"if you just need some extra money in your pockets this is great but "
good,"you can""t cut hours at same time as trying to increase customer service programs. it is counter productive to good customer service in today's competitive environment."
good,"If the managers helped sales associates instead of yelling at them to pick up the pace and just standing there, it would have been a better workplace. Overall, it wasn't a hard job, and they worked with your schedule most of the time."
good,Since it was retail it was only busy depending on the time of year. My co workers were good.  The fitting area was sometimes hectic but customers had no problem with waiting their turn.  The phones were always busy except overnight.  Loved working overnigjt there.  I was there 2 years.  Had i not ran into health issues i would have stayed at WL-Mart.
good,"The managers are unorganized and do not know how to make the work place flow smoothly. It was good hours, but I was not treated that well. The paychecks were good."
good,I mean what much can you expect from working at Walmart? You have to work with a bunch of people every day and most of them are rude and hateful. Sometimes you get lucky and find nice people that are shopping and they make your day. It is a good job to get your foot in the door on sales. Not a job you want to work forever though.
good,"It is a job, not a career. There is nothing difficult about the job, it's all about just doing your job. It is an easy job to work around school with."
good,"It was a good place to work for 14 years, but I am happy for new experiences and adventures.  I worked in a smaller facility with limited opportunities for growth."
good,"Ok place to work for, toward the end poor management and not enough pay. The new manager that came in would not let me hire the people that I wanted to hire. Most of the time we worked short handed and that put a lot of stress on me and fellow employees."
good,"My typical day of work included manning the front door , answering customers questions , being available to assist customers with special needs in their shopping experience . I was able to float through the store into other positions such as work in the Sporting Goods department. There was really no Hard part to this Job. It was Low Pay with Self Gratification in helping others in need."
good,"Walmart is an okay place to work at. If you don’t mind having to do your work and other peoples work, an ever changing policy, your hours cut without hesitation, and them not caring about anything. It’s not a family company as they advertise. It’s just a big business trying to rise up. The only good thing was the quarterly bonuses and the coworkers who understood the pain of everything."
good,Would not prefer to work. Very poor management. Work culture is not good. So many people do not work just hang out there and management does not tell them anything but make other people do their work.
good,I loved working with customers and the job was busy fast paced. Management changed so much and they used to care more about their employees but slowly started taking bonuses away sick pay and holiday pay would'nt recommend the job
good,"Upon clocking in I would head over to my register that I was stationed at, followed by counting the till to verify it was $100. I would then start taking customers to check out the items they had gathered up in the store. Management was on hand to assist if ever needed with an error in the machine or change that would be needed. The hardest park of the job was running into an error with the machine when you have a long line and are trying to do things diligently. Most enjoyable part of the day would be to ring out final customers and go home"
good,"na"
good,"The management team and especially the store manager demands a lot from any kind of management position. Benefits are good so long as you make enough for it to come out of your check. But the healthcare sucks, everything else is straight. It is a great job for part-time as long as you have good work ethic."
good,Many  Changes made in the Company. They  made me perform more duties without a reasonable pay raise. They make people work crazy shifts.That make you physically and mentally tired.
good,"Dead end job, bad taste in management. Too many responsibilities expected on employee. Lack of time to get the job done. Not the best place to work. -"
good,"There wasn't really a typical workday. You didn't know what you were doing until you got there. It did teach me that sometimes to get the task done you have to put your own spin on how your doing your work. No one method works with everybody. It also taught me that although you need to get the job done quickly, speed and safety don't go hand and hand. You'll always be lowering priority on one to do the other better. As far as a workplace goes it wasn't all bad. The most enjoyable part of the day was that we were all the same when it came to associates in the same position. Our mindset was the same and our sense of humor was the same. Even our supervisor was a joker like the rest of us. The reason I rated job culture so low is because of the management. They are fully aware that the hours for aisles are a lot of the time wrong, but still expect it done by that time. They will tell you to go home for being sick, and then point you the next day. The worst thing about them is that they'll set standards and then immediately make it impossible. For example, we're suppose to have 8 people working the truck at any given moment. We had 6 that day. They want the truck unloaded in an hour and a half. Within 30 minutes of working the truck, two of us get taken off the truck to pull carts outside. Then one of us has an anxiety attack and goes home. They still expected it done in an hour and a half."
good,"I was terminated from Walmart for failure to support the violence in the workplace policy.  I was attacked by a customer and I defended myself.  For that I was terminated.  As as result, I give Walmart very low scores."
good,"It is a good job don't get me wrong. It is fairly easy for the most part, but one manager would tell you something and another would tell you something else. The pay is great, but the main reason I looked for other careers is lack of time with the family. The DC closes one day a year and that is Christmas and you have to have PTO time to cover it for you don't get paid. The last Thanksgiving we was in there for 14 hours. I feel that a job should know better then to work people that long on a holiday. You never know how long your day might be but you usually work about 10 hours a day on weekdays."
good,unload the truck put merchandise on pallets and sometime stock the merchandise on the floor. i learned that managers can be very rude . the workplace culture was not good at all.
good,"a fast paced, stressful place, learn new tasks, can change jobs internally to learn new things and move up, if you would like to advance and take college courses they will work with you and help you with finances, the have good benefits"
good,"I am all for accountability for employees, but when upper management uses policies and procedures to nitpick you, it gets really old fast.  The big corporate culture that places more emphasis on numbers ahead of the employees and the patients is ridiculous.  The institution of policies and procedures that defy common sense because we are scared of getting sued is mind-boggling."
good,"Siempre tratando de hacer una empresa mas unificada mediante actividades desde el dia a dia hasta cosas mas eventuales, tratando de compensar algunos otros rubros que no pueden mejorar"
good,it is a faced paced job. very competive work. you either keep up or your out. always evolving. two 15 minutes break an an hour lunch. a lot of walking.
good,"I would recommend anyone to work at Walmart. They have great pay and for the most part you are certain to get your hours. For the store that i currently work in, I do not recommend working in CAP 2 because you are underpaid for the amount of work that you have to do compared to other departments around the store. Other than this, it is pretty good."
good,"Not the best place to work at . Management always overwork employees , they play favoritism , and they are not organized at all . They promise raises and bonuses but that’s not true ."
good,"There isn't enough time in the day to accomplish the tasks. It seems like this company is moving towards automation and doesn't want more than a skeleton staff. "
good,"If you need a job while you attend school or are between jobs it is an ok job. Career advancement into management is extremely limited. Full time positions are limited, and you should expect to work abnormal hours. "
good,"It  is  difficult to say   how the  culture  is at  Wal Mart, because   the  Managers  I  had when I was there were  horrible. They  did  not  care about there  employees, and when I came  in sick, they  threatened to fire  me. Maybe  the  Managers  there today  are  better, I hope for the employees  sake  who are there, but  mine did  not care about  people."
good,The management on my shift just got too out of control and the power went to their heads. They did not treat all of the associates the same and those of us who were management did not get treated well at all.
good,"It's been a very long time since I last worked at Walmart. This was back when the starting pay was $7.70. At that time, working as a cashier was very stressful given i was the only register open on most days of my shift. We did get two 15 minute breaks and a one hour lunch."
good,Everyone was nice. Co workers were easy to get along with. Managers were actually respectful. I left because I wanted a set schedule and they would not give me one.
good,Não existe vida social depois de entrar no Walmart
good,I liked the career advice given to me from my manager when I first started there I learned 80 pop percent of my customer service experience with hands on work and customers were always complicating me but manager failed to notice.
good,Walmart offers great benefits but management is very poor. There are a lot of racial issue. There are a lot of issues with advancement opportunities {if you are not a yes person you will be overlooked for advancement).
good,"It was a good starter job, but it is hard to make promotions even though you were told you were going to get them. Management is relaxed but the job and customers can be chaotic."
good,"i had to work in indescribable conditions , it was not fun at all the mangers would smile to your face and ask you to work hard but when it came to bonuses and a raise they find anything to keep you where you're at."
good,Not a bad place to work. Fast paced friendly people. Enjoyed my time there for the most part. Most difficult part for me was i didn't really have a set schedule for example i would work 2pm till 11pm then 8am till 5pm the next day.
good,"The experience of the job depended on how your Walmart was and how your associates are. Each Walmart speaks for themselves. During the time I worked at Walmart, the managers who over saw the departments were switched every six months. The manager that was still over our department had no clue how to run the department or the merchandise. She overrode the system a lot except for when someone above her had to override the system. The experience will differ from each Walmart."
good,It wasn’t too bad. All customers were friendly. Management was pretty good. Just some managers needed better time management . Overall the company is a good company to work for.
good,I mainly got the job to cover bills. The co-workers were friendly and I enjoyed being around them. Management did what they could to make working as fun as possible for everyone. Customers could be less than appreciate on a regular basis.
good,"Fast pace environment especially for a cashier on weekends. "
good,"Working at here was not bad at times. Working on the front-end can be overwhelming. The associates tends to be all over the place. I worked in pets and chemical but was placed in almost all department to work. Which isn't bad unless you have assignments to do in your department and that's always. However, I had a lot of fun working there. Walmart is a family environment. The workers needs to get paid more"
good,If you need work and the year hiring then apply but keep an eye out for other positions at other companies. Management is horrible and do not care about workers or customer care for that matter.
good,"The pay was really high and the hours were amazing. The management lived up to the bad reputation of their company. The Walmart emotionless drone culture was strongly imbued and the people were nasty. "
good,"It’s nice job for a person that’s like being over worked,stressed and having  no life. The Lack of help is just terrible; some days you come in to work your thinking your going to be doing one thing your doing another. The managers don’t know what their doing or want to do. The whole place is just a headache."
good,Be on time. Take your breaks on point. Let the store know ahead of time of being late or absent . Be true to your availability don’t put yours you want our hours that you could work
good,I started as a cashier then moved to customer service. Once i got into the groove of things at the service desk i was looking to try another position at the store but no matter how hard i tried and asked i never got the chance to move up in the company.
good,"Good workplace , calm easy going, but poor management and poor scheduling system. Could be different now that its under new management , system could be different too"
good,"Good for a temporary job. Management does play favorites a lot. It reminds me of high school. You tend to have to take on a huge work load, and have to beg someone when you need help."
good,"see what needed to be done "
good,"Heavy lifting up to more than 50lbs"
good,I loved working at Walmart and regret the times I quit because there were some enjoyable moments and the pay was great. The only thing that bothered me the most was there was some managers that would often choose who they got in trouble or who they liked. They would get onto the ones they didn’t like for the smallest of things and not say anything to the ones they do like. Also when I reapplied for a job the second time they lied to me on numerous amounts about not hiring or they couldn’t hire me because of corporate. I ended up calling corporate and they said there was no reason they couldn’t hire me. I never really had anything bad said about me that I know of so I could never understand why they would lie to me and refuse to hire me.
good,"I worked my up through the company and never had an interest in salary. Eliminated from one position only to find out my current position is doing tge same, so now I look for stability in another company. My years have been good but now it's time to move on."
good,there to much drama some ones made or upset about this or that. you cant have a life because it upsets someone your not aloud to and if the boss doesn't like you for some reason then your always getting the boot if your on the good side your always right even when your wrong.
good,"It used to be a fun and rewarding place to work, but now hours are being cut and job security is low. The new maternity benefits are great, but in return they dock hours and leave is short handed on a regular basis."
good,"While having worked for the company for the last 15 years, overall I would say the experience was a good one. However the last two years under my new store manager were very difficult. Each set back even if not the fault of the store ( logistic issues with delivers ) was seen as a purposeful failure to make them look bad.  12 plus hours days that were only scheduled to be 10 hours days on a near consistant basis added to stress problems as well as personal health problems."
good,worked there for five years managers are scum and they don't treat you like a human kojarity of the time. if you want the benefits and money go ahead other than that look towards the shipyard
good,"For first time employment, being a cashier isn't bad. After enough experience, you can apply for different positions depending on availability. Benefits aren't great but at least there's something."
good,I'm a cashier. I love the customers fast pace. Crazy work hours though. The job though is getting a little much. I'm 5 months pregnant and being a cashier having to left and turn is getting to much.
good,I applied for a job that I was told I would be working 30-36 hours a week I am only recieving 18-21hrs a week. I also did not get the pay raise when minimum wage went up.
good,Management works you like a dog and do not want to give you overtime you have to cut any overtime you accumulate and management holds you accountable for it
good,"Got forced to switch positions because of someone else's mistake, and switching positions has taken me nearly a month. Cart pushing was a fun job on a daily basis, kept me busy, got to greet and assist customers, but the heat of New Mexico during the summer was really bad. Also, they didn't have the necessary equipment to perform the job properly. I later switched into asset protection, and the manager was replaced as soon as I got the job. I was unaware that the manager was going to be dropped, and the replacement was less than pleasant."
good,"This company is productive, but cutthroat and stressful. It's very competitive. There is a whole lot of drama with working at Walmart and if you're not careful, you will end up getting pulled into it."
good,"coworkers make the day go faster, easy work, computer trained, typically 9 hour shifts with an hour lunch and two breaks. the hardest part is dealing with angry customers"
good,"A typical day as a cashier at Walmart would be what you would expect, horde after horde of customers that you must check out. I was tasked with operating the self checkout system and had to focus on multiple machines at once."
good,I believe management would rather take 20 mins finding someone to do a 5 min task versus doind the task and getting it done. Delegation is stupid when it the task could be done. Management should dig in and help their associates more instead requesting a whole lot and seeing things not finished up.
good,Its just like working at any retail store except its bigger so there more work to do but that's nice cause it gives you something to do because if you do nothing you get in trouble.
good,"I enjoyed my job, only two of the managers made me feel.. welcomed but my main manager was very nice. I liked what I did and I was good at it, I just was going through a huge life change and also had other stuff going on with other family members, I had to leave my position at walmart."
good,"great experience being a cashier, handling cash, balancing cash, helping customer for merchandise , credit card bill payments, return items on customer service desk"
good,I work 10 plus hours a day and over 50 hours a week. I had overtime every week which is what made my job worth it. Without the OT pay the money sucks. My team always got OT as well.
good,Working at Walmart was just fine. It had great coworkers but the thing was management didnt know what they were doing. Sadly they dont keep anyone around long term cause people stand up for themselves
good,The team work was very bad. CSMs never wnared to help you when you needed it. They never wanted to give you money for your till. The managers were nice.
good,Need less favortism. N more teamwork instead of competeing. Awesome place to work if not trying tocompete pay could be more because its a busy business
good,"management always changed   cant work overtime ever , they r on a point system for attendance  and call off oil change was busy all day long most days"
good,"A typical day at work involves throwing freight, scanning bins and working overstock merchandise to the shelves.  You must also make sure that the overstock merchandise that won't fit on the shelf or a riser gets labeled and binned in the backroom."
good,My experience working at walmart was ok at first. There was bullying with other associates anfd tried to get help but management said I was wasting their time.  You work very hard for little recognition and you really do end up feeling like the company doesn't care about it's employees the way they are treated. Just another Corporate Job that only cares about bucks.
good,Great company . I actually miss it alot. I love working hard especially for a company like Walmart .very very good experience for me . Id recommend to anyone
good,It was ok not enough hours and days all was changed no steady work schedule. People are nice to long of lunch break but overall not a bad place to work if a part time job will feel your needs.
good,Wal-Mart overall is an average place however starting out. They don't teach you well and expect new hires to know everything they're supposed to do in a few days. The pay is low and the insurance is expensive. You get a discount of 10% off of non-edible items. Nothing off groceries though! They expect people to do 3 peoples worth of work. If you're a hard obedient worker work their temporarily. Don't work midnights
good,Empresa sem chances de crescimento e baixo salário
good,Walmart was a extremely hard place to work for. Breaks never come on time . There were a lot of problems at the Walmart I worked for. Management didn’t commute properly.
good,"Working at Sam's Club was Amazing at first. I learned a lot from my Team Lead, My team and former coworkers was nothing short of amazing, but unfortunately my life goals exceeded the position at Sam's club."
good,"I was really excited to work for walmart. In training they talk a lot about the ""open door policy"" and caring about what the employees have to say, but in reality once you finish training they just throw you out on the floor and treat you stupid if you have questions."
good,During my time at walmart I ended up having a child that had problems during birth and had to miss work although I called daily and kept them I formed my manager still gave me issues
good,"starts out with turning everything on in both deli and bakery so there all warmed up and ready for the day. go back and print off production planners if needed. then go back and break out donuts, bake and glaze and ice. pull out bread to proof, pull out bread for sandwiches if not some in cooler from previous day. then help pack donuts. make sandwichs, wraps, salads, bothe lettace and cold case ones. make sure everyone is doing there job and ask them if they need help. cause were so short staffed here everyone has to work as a team."
good,"I actually enjoyed my job, it was just the poor management that made things hard for myself and others as well, I would still give it another chance because the schedules worked well with my daily life."
good,"Not my place to work, but if you like working nights it would be the best place to start. Gets a bit depressing over the winter. great discounts also!"
good,Walmart was ok to me the only problem is the managers are Terrible there some don’t care about there employees some of them  but the overall is ok love my coworkers
good,"Walmart has served my needs for provision. Ive learned many things through them. How to multi task witg deadlines, medications,  more of the optical world as well."
good,"The only way to really make it in this company was to either be an assistant manager or a store manager. For the amount of work they wanted you to do, it was not equal to amount of pay given. I worked for almost 10 years and still way making under $13 an hour. And for the departments that were specail enough to make $15. You had to just be really good and what you did or they passed you by."
good,"Throughout the day, you must deal with customers ranging from very courteous and understanding to extremely demanding and rude. The work is simple, but it is constant and fast paced, and, as a cashier,  you deal with the short comings of all the other departments and end up having to rectify them. Do not recommend if you don't like working with the general public, but if you want to learn people skills, this is a good jump off the deep end with instant feedback. And the employee discount is only %10, not including most food products, so not good if that's factored into you applying. His ranged from low 20s to high 30s weekly, and 4 to 8 hours daily"
good,"Wal-Mart is comparable to high school kinda, if they like you then good for you, you'd probably have a shot to move up in the company. If you're not a favorite of your current manager then try to leave your current role and get another manager over you, they have the power to make your work experience pretty helatious."
good,"It is a very fast paced job. Delivering to 5-8 stores a day and return to the yard in 14hrs or less. I learned how to deal with different managers, and remain professional. The hardest part of the job was finding some of the stores, only because it is such a large company with stores popping up constantly. Best part of the job was being able to get grocery shopping done on your way. The people at this particular terminal were great. I really miss them."
good,Working at Wal-Mart was over all a good experience. Customer service was number one priority! The reason I left my job at Wal-Mart was because work hours were not flexible enough once I started a family
good,"Long hours and very hot.  I liked tht I was paid weekly other than that general retail job. Also, season ends so workload mainly during the hot days and hours of the summer"
good,Not a bad place to work. Other co workers are on the same level and help out alot when you need it. Fairly time demanding when trucks are late and things don't move the way they need.
good,"We have to clean up left over freight of the mornings, which puts us behind 2-3 hours. Required to complete process,and now the additional detail zone before we get to go home. Why cut the staff so short if you plan on working people to death."
good,"Wal-Mart is a selfish company. They work you just under full time hours and the insurance is extremely high. They are not flexible for family, weekends or holidays. "
good,It's ok but don't give enough hours per week and no respect don't treat employees very well at all but does have good benefits and enjoy pushing carts...
good,When I worked at Walmart I felt like we was over worked and underpaid. I just made friends with the other employees to pass time and I did what was asked and what I seen that need to be done.
good,"Este es un trabajo en el que tienes que dar el 100,se maneja higiene y seguridad.Hay que cuidar la limpieza de tu área por las constantes revisiones de ECOLAB. Aprendí la correcta forma de lavado en frutas y verduras.Aunque antes laboraba como auxiliar de limpieza. No puedo dar una opinión muy profunda de gerencia puesto que solo llevo unos meses laborando aquí,pero la tienda marcha bien.Es la que más vende frutas y verduras a nivel regional."
good,"Each store operates differently. Being close to the home office makes it a stricter workplace with insane amount of drama. Management does not bother to remember your name and will make you work outside of your job title, especially with maintenance. Do not be afraid to transfer to another facility for your own personal gain."
good,Worked for them in 2004. Not sure what has changed if anything at all. Left them due to them lying about me getting a raise and the shift I would be working. The job itself was decent but the Walmart name speaks for itself.
good,Working nights in an office with no windows and no help on busy nights.  The cash office was ok and could be done in 8 hours but during holidays it was impossible and received no help.
good,"Una empresa buena, con una demanda grande, pero sus salarios son muy bajos"
good,"My opinion on Walmart is a mixed one. When I Started for the company, it was great. The associates, the management, everything. There was room for advancement, and they were always looking to promote from within. Once I moved up in the company, thats when things changed. Management became more ""bossy"", associates became disrespectful, and once on salary, the hours became unbearable."
good,"Very liberal absent policy for hourly employees.  Made completing my duties very difficult as I was always filling in for someone who was missing."
good,"Management is lazy. Micromanaging is prevalent and diminishes positive attitudes. Low pay, making it difficult to pay standard bills. Could be improved."
good,i liked working there just not enough pay an hours learned to how to deal with unhappy customers an loved it when ppl was happy made my day.i could use telezon to look up prices an got to experence alot of personal
good,"Provide customer service by acknowledging the customer, identify customer needs"
good,"Walmart can be a hit and miss type job. You can move up within the company with a lot of hard work and continued learning, but it will take you awhile to get there,"
good,The good thing about working here is that it is very past-paced and allows me to work in a variety of areas. I was able to learn many skills because of this.
good,Hard work fast pace required need to work many departments a night and then you get yelled at for not completing 5 departments even though theres at least 40+ hours of work
good,great place to start off as an entry level job. the job is simple after you get it going on your own. you learn to stock shelves and assemble items as well as maintaining customer satisfaction. management was poor due to lack of communication.
good,"My work experience at Wal-Mart was not bad, but it wasn't good either. There was hardly any team work and very few hard workers. I worked there for about a year and nine months until I found a better job which was king soopers."
good,"Too much work for too little money. Poor management. Lack of advancement. Can be fun if you're working with the right people, otherwise it's mind numbing"
good,At times I love working there and at times I hate it. I think that’s with any place. The money is ok for what ur doing there.  I’ve worked in several Dept’s there. Produce has been my favorite and I’ve learned a lot there. Walmart’s not a bad company to work for if you can stay away from the drama and politics.
good,I was full time. now I am part time . All the workers rely on others to get their work done .The work can be very stressful . On your shorter 4 hour shifts they still want you to get 8 hours of work done .
good,"Comme premier emploi et emploi étudiant, c'est correct. Ce qui est surtout insupportable, ce sont les clients."
good,very strict point system supposed to work with you and don't it very hard to get days off you need because schedule is made three weeks out they are able to make changes to schedule and do not in form you of these changes
good,"Due to being a full time student, my schedule was always being switched around not allowing me to perform my best ability at both school and work.  Although Walmart did allow me to pay school things off."
good,Mangers were horrible never could get them to sit down and talk when I had a problem other than that pay was alright for a first job but not a job that will last.
good,Walmart Management made this job stressful on all employees including themselves. They blow most things out of proportion and were libel to write you up for anything.
good,Laid back for the most part. It's a simple and easy job for anyone looking to find somewhere to work for their first job in high school. I wouldnt reccomend for a permanent job though.
good,"As a shopper and former employee of Walmart, it's not a bad place to work. My only complaint really is the amount they pay you for only getting paid bi-weekly."
good,"Learn quickly you are put on a register within the same day. It's not a hard job at all, but you will get a work out when checking customers out with their purchases."
good,Can be a laid back work environment as long as you follow the rules. Customer service is a must. If you are not a people person I would not advise you even apply to work at any Walmart
good,"I enjoyed when I first started working on the floor, stacking shelves and doing picks, but once I was moved into the fresh area with the food it seemed that I couldn't move out of the food service area. I went to Walmart to get away from the restaurant style work and it seems they just threw me back into it."
good,"WalMart is a job that is defined by the capabilities of the management staff. Their decision-making skills can lead to easy, productive work shifts or unnecessarily complicated, disastrous work shifts. The supercenters require lots of maintenance and often have large volumes of customers to deal with. Choosing the right priorities is key to getting through each shift, keeping the store in proper order, and keeping the customers happy."
good,Wal-Mart is a big company that is very successful. They work hard to improve every year with the help from their employees. I started almost 5 years ago. Every year there are layoffs. The amount of pay has stayed the same and the company keeps increasing the amount of sales every year. At the shareholders meeting they announced how well the company is doing. Another 1000 associates will soon be let go. A great company but a terrible company to work for.
good,Only worked at Walmart for about 6 months and that was after high school so I don't remember too much about it I know my management weren't too kind I worked in the meat department so it was unboxing me putting it out making sure they were dated taking out dated stop and putting them in a big bucket with moral dated stuff what I most enjoyed about working at Walmart or the discounts people weren't that bad but I didn't like about why working at Walmart is people walking to your department and tell you what to do even if you were busy and the drama between coworkers
good,"The whole purpose of me working at Wal-Mart was to work in electronics. It was full when I applied, so they put me in toys instead, because they also had a shortage there. Nearly a year later they hire numerous people in electronics. I've asked if I can move to electronics multiple times... Instead, they need help in Toys still... If they want more help in toys, they should say theres no space in Electronics like they did to me and move them in to toys, and move someone who has been waiting patiently, who has shown interest since they arrived. You know, maybe a person like me? (I should also mention similar scenarios have happened to coworkers)"
good,Not the best when you are young because they want the job to be your life and work over your allotted amount of hours. I would not recommend Walmart to many people unless they desperately needed a job.
good,"If you want to go back to high school and have a lot of drama Wal-Mart is your place, Communication is horrible, Assistant Managers will tell you one thing and another will come behind them and tell you differently. Then The store manager will tell you another way. So you have to do the job 3 times before it's finally right."
good,"Walmart can be a good place to work, but a few bad apples ruin the whole bunch. Outside of the crazy scheduling and the side deals to undercut your coworkers, managers try their best to make work twice as hard as it needs to be."
good,Not a bad place to work however over the past couple years the company has restructured several times causing fewer opportunities for promotions. As well as causing several people to be displaced from their jobs. The company is not bad but is nowhere near done restructuring. There is no job security anymore.
good,Started with Walmart 16 years ago when it was fun and the past year and a half it has been a struggle just to go to work and thays because of the main management.  When you feel like you are being targeted and not developed you feel defeated.  When you can't do anything right because no matter what you do your manager says it isn't right you feel like a failure.
good,"Pharmacy can be a very tough environment, working with people you enjoy, makes the difference. My RPh was amazing, my co-workers were knowledgeable, helpful. "
good,"It's a good place to work at for awhile, but as soon as you decide you want to move up they won't let you move up. management is never on the same page, management is actually pretty bad. but you just have to learn to deal with the rude customers, and kind of just focus on your job and you will be alright."
good,High turn over. even in management makes for an unstable work force and low moral.This would be an ok part time position for teens looking to get into the working world but as a sustainable career i dont believe Walmart offers a large enough salary to support a house hold while saving for retirement.
good,Working for walmart was a nice experience through a temp service and as the years passed they have not hired me permanently but was willing and offered by there staff
good,"I’ve work for Walmart for 6 years and I’ve hard for them"
good,"I worked overnight shift doing mods. I enjoyed the people I worked with, we all became one big family. My job consisted in setting the store to the specifications the home office sent."
good,"decent first place to work, but not a great company to stay with your entire career unless you have thick skin and no soul. a typical day at work was usualy busy for me, bouncing between running a cash register, running my department, and trying to get everything stocked."
good,Very fast paced environment can become difficult to keep up with.  Also management is difficult to get along with sometimes.  When there is an issue brought up to the upper management there is little to nothing done about the issue.
good,We would all meet up in the back room take down assignments we would work until lunch during these periods of working we would joke around occasionally we would listen to music to help time go by faster and then befor we clock out we would clean the back room
good,"I don't want to write a review based strictly on the management but i will say that good management makes the job better. There was a recent change to the overall dress code at Walmart that made it much more relaxed. It was the most positive change I had seen them make in my years there. They did away with Holiday pay, sick pay, and vacation pay. Now you aren't compensated AT ALL for working holidays and your sick pay and vacation pay are lumped together in a category they dubbed ""PTO or Paid Time Off"". Also, you aren't given PTO at the beginning of new fiscal year, you have to earn it by working (x) amount of time to earn (x) amount of PTO time. Associates of Walmart are being increasingly DE-prioritized as time passes. The entire company is built around a high turn over rate. One person can be fired or leave the company and they can have another one in his or her spot within a weeks time that knows enough to do the basic work.There is almost know reason to really try and grow with the company. This year alone they did a company wide liquidation of the ""CO-manager"" position. Effectively removing several thousand jobs. Walmart did give them options as to whether or not they wanted to stay with the company in another position or take a severance package though. We lost two of the stores best managers when this happened that together had over 45 years with the company and ran the store better than the actual store manager at that time did. But I guess that's the type of sacrifices big business has to make in order to stay on top. On a positive note i met a lot of nice people and"
good,Its an alright place to work.  Management was poor at the time and did not care about the employees. Management pretty much ignored staff and their issues.
good,It was ok and good during cap 2 when I switched to overnight I hated it and was not allowed to go back to cap 2 due to management and other associates bringing lies and home life to work with drama
good,Worked at Wal-Mart but may never again. I was fired because of missing to many days after my daughter had surgery that ended up with complications. Whiched caused her to be in and out of the hospital. Wal-Mart didn't care because everyobe there is disposable.
good,"Working in walmart's toy department shifts between easy going to cut-throat depending on the season and day of the week. management can be an issue if they can't/won't acknowledge this fact.  other employees are often willing to help out in other departments, provided that management is good.  I took the time to learn how the paint machine operated so that I could assist when they were understaffed in that department, but again the manager of that department became rather territorial about who would be allowed to work with the paint machine.  I was eventually told that I would be allowed to help, but this revealed to me that there was a lot of miscommunication between managers.  The best thing about working in this location is and always will be the kind and polite customers.  The hardest part would be the occasional rowdy customer, and upper management."
good,"Walmart is a good place to begin to gain new job skills for possible future job advancements, or others jobs. Such skills to obtain would be Cash Handling, Friendly Customer Service, and Multitasking."
good,Yes Wal-Wart is productive workplace but at the same time it lacks sufficient opportunity to grow and advance and proper management. There I'd also a lack of communication and team effort in certain areas of the company and a-lot of that is overlooked and needs to be brought to light.
good,"They prefer to keep you by yourself and that makes the day go by slow and dreadful, management is helpful but it really depends on the person. If you need the excercise then this is a good place because your always on your feet."
good,"If you have a good management team you're all set, But more often than not you only have 1-2 good managers. While the rest are mediocre at best. often one associate maybe two in the department will do all the work while the others loaf about. many times the complaints of said associates are ignored."
good,"Working at Walmart was a temporary thing for me to do, after getting out of the nursing job I was previously in. The hours vary too much for me, I have worked anywhere from 12 hour weeks, all the way up to 40 hour weeks. I enjoy the staff that I work with, and my front end management team, but it is not something that I can allow myself to stick with because of the inconsistent hours. I need something that can guarantee me to get 40 hour weeks, as well as consistent pay."
good,It was a good experience at a young age but deffineltly not a place you would continue to work there for the rest of your life . Its been so long since I worked there I don't remember much.
good,"Environment was good.  "
good,Starts off quick. We get the numbers for the day. We find out where we are working. We check out our equipment. Drive our equipment to where we are working. Log into our computers and get to work.
good,I was given a promotion at a young age and was able to balance work and school life easily. This job came with few challenges but always left work with a smile on my face. Great group of people to work with.
good,"I would get panic attacks after working at Walmart for a month or two. I didn't leave in the best way by not giving 2 weeks or even saying a word because I really grew to hate the place. It was terrible, some of the staff was amazing I'll give them that but other then else I absolutely hated working there."
good,"I enjoyed my time while working there, but it did not have excellent benefits. I would have liked having more hours, and noticed that on many occasions, I did not recieve breaks."
good,"some stores are better than others, but customer service in the Louisville, ky area is HORRIBLE. management is the same way. in one of my old stores (i transferred a few times) there was a saying painted on a manager's office wall saying ""take care of our associates and they will take care of our customers"" that saying is SO TRUE. but with rude and hateful management, comes rude and hateful associates. if the ""lower"" employees are treated badly by supervisors/managers, they will treat the customers the same. the stores that have friendlier managers, have better customer service ratings, point blank."
good,"As a seasonal hire and being fairly inexperienced at the time, I would say I got the best deal I was going to find anywhere.  The management at my particular store left something to be desired, but that might have just been knowing many of us would be here and gone in four months.  The hours changed weekly, but were posted in enough time that you knew your schedule and the wage were equal to what you'd get anywhere else for the same job."
good,"The job can be good at some points but very bad in others. The pay wasn't too bad but the hours were scattered. During the springtime, hours were getting cut from 32 hours a week to sometimes 8-16 hours. They would raise our pay but schedule us less. Management was very spotty and the turn around on staff was terrible."
good,Walmart was a great experience for me while I was in college and shortly after college while I was looking for a job in my field. The hours were good for me as well as the pay and benefits.
good,"I would definitely recommend Walmart for someone looking to move up and make a career of it or who is in school. The pay is decent, you get a discount card(after 3 mos) and they have to work around your school schedule(once hired). There is also a good chance you can make a career of it and move up the ladder."
good,"management needs to step up, i always felt like i was the one always doing the work,the pay wasn't too bad, 2 15 min breaks for ppl that worked 6 hours or more"
good,"This company is the largest private employer in the US, which is both good and bad. It is good because there is advancement opportunity and opportunities for job continuity if relocating; it is bad because the company often treats employees as cogs in a machine rather than people with lives outside of work. Furthermore, in recent months, the home office has been increasing efforts to micromanage stores, rather than letting management in stores adjust practices and policies in keeping with local and regional differences. While a modicum of standardization is desirable within a company, recognition of regional differences is a key to growing sales; what works in one area may not work so well in another. I believe that this micromanagement will likely be harmful to the company as a whole."
good,"Some ""supervisors"" were incompetent in their jobs.  They did things other regular employees likely would have gotten written up for.  Perhaps I should have transferred to another store.  Maybe my overall experience with the company would have been better."
good,The management there was not wal Mart aware of how to implement there own procedure is was constint  confusion.they did not know what to do when it came to parental leave and things like switching days.
good,this job was not the best job i have worked u was not working eight per day u would get there and two later u was sent home because no work was avaiable
good,Walmart does not foster company loyalty.  If an employee has an extended illness they don't know if they will have a job when released by Dr.  Alot if change over in upper management.
good,"If you are creative, decorating the cakes is fun even if you are limited to only certain designs. However trying to keep up with the amount they want produced in the number of work hours given is almost impossible. Job involves long hours standing on concrete."
good,this was nice and quiet management trusted you to get your stuff done and do what you had to to go home was relaxing and calm but the pay was low and no insurance or extras
good,The good place just don't like the hours I've never worked at 2 to 11 job so it was a bit much for me to get used to but all in all it was a good experience it is a good experience for me because I've never worked customer service before
good,"It is a great place to work, and the pay is reasonable for the work. Coworkers were always nice, friendly, but the management was very one sided. If anyone had a problem with one of the few in the ""clique"" it would be hard to make a change in the company."
good,Walmart has been an interesting learning experience.. The co-workers and great customers enhances working there overall. It is greatly flexible making it a good part time job to coordinating  with school.
good,"The pay was not worth dealing with hostile shoplifters and thieves. To do your job well you have to put your life at risk with every thief you catch.  Sometimes they fight back or carry weapons,"
good,Hired strictly for the stocking for Christmas season.  
good,Walmart is a good workplace. Management needs improvement and better training. Employees work very hard and do a great jobs completing their tasks as well as helping with costumer service.
good,"My normal day usually involves picking up returns every half an hour, placing the items on the shelves, and straightening my section so everything looks neat. However, I can end up being tossed to three or four other departments and then be questioned on why my department looks a mess. I am often expected to pick up after 1st and 3rd shift while my shift never gets additional help. This job is good if you don't care for a team environment. But nothing else. Management will happily gnaw at you for everything you do incorrectly, but will never (or rarely ever) give you praise for doing well."
good,"Working for Walmart has its ups and downs. The first 3 years it was a fun family friendly environment. With the changes in management over time it became more intense and over whelming, most manager have little to no respect for their employees"
good,Good pay with good benefits but not enough help and very stressful.  I was very happy as a support manager but was forced into managing the meat department because they couldn't find a manager. I was forced to manage the department at times by my self when there should always be 4 people in it.
good,"Walmart is not a terrible place to work, although that could entirely depend on the other associates in whichever department one might find oneself. The benefits are okay."
good,"Inconsistency in policy enforcement, and the unwillingness to provide consistent, full-time hours is deplorable. Your mileage will vary, of course, as every store plays by its own rules. If you don't intend on a career in retail, but you need some cash, walmart will take all comers. Their disciplinary system is one of disallowing promotions should you be actioned in any way, which can happen without warning or consistency as the things one manager may tell you could go against another, and all of them have power over you simultaneously. I was very lucky to be directly beneath good managers, but the crooked ones still had all the power they needed to ruin any hope of bettering my situation, which has left me jaded and disenchanted."
good,"Working in retail for many years, this job was evidence that not all of it is created equal. Management was very cut throat, and contradicted each other on numerous occasions. Direction was never given clearly and surprised popped up on a regular basis. As a result it was very easy to end up in trouble for things that were completely arbitrary. Not recommended for most people unless in desperate need of a job. The pay is not good at all, the expectations are extremely high despite this."
good,La cultural laboral es complicada hay mucha competencia entre personas del mismo equipo de trabajo y entre equipos de trabajo. Muy demandante con horarios complicados. Difícil mantener un equilibrio de vida personal con las jornadas de trabajo.
good,"theres not much to expect when working for a retail giant, the benefits were pretty good after you have to work there for a year. They offer 15 minute and 30 minute breaks and have a fully furnished break room  with T.V. and microwave. Job is tedious and fast paced"
good,walmart needs to focus more on individuals needs and not the store as a whole.  better training one on one. they need to know that certain people require more training than others
good,Mala organización en las labores que le correspondían a cada uno
good,There’s always something to do ranging from checking out customers to cleaning up lines. The points they give you for calling off or being late is something I would consider before working at Walmart.
good,"The employees working their with me were great, open for switching hours and the like. However, we would have to go through management to get these approved and they were either given to the wrong people or they were out right denied without any notice."
good,"I learned a lot working in Walmart.The  new management I did not like but other than that it was okay , working there was my first job and I have to say that I learned a lot."
good,"Some of the management does not allow for any relaxing time, even during breaks, which leads to resentment of the management system. The break room is always neat and tidy"
good,I only worked part time at walmart and would have stayed if I had not decided to relocate to north carolina. The only thing that I did not like about working at walmart was I had no set schedule but that may have been becasue I was part time?
good,The people are fun to work with. The managers that look out for their employees they get rid of. Most managers don't have a clue. We do get a discount. If your full time you can get benefits.
good,"The job pays well and the benefits are good, however there is little work/life balance in the role. Frequently expected to work 12+ hour days or come in on days off to cover sick calls or risk ""accountability"".  Was transferred from a store that was a 10 minute walk from my house to a store that was an hour and 15 minute drive away. I didn't have a car at the time and was given 2 days notice of the change. When I asked for more time before transferring I was told no because the other store needed me right away."
good,"Sim era uma empresa agradável de trabalhar, expressar, ouvir, treinamentos, condições boas de trabalho, segurança, epis, local de trabalho ecelentes, banheiros, refeitórios, almoço e janta muito boa comida !"
good,It's not always easy dealing with customers. I liked my coworkers while working at this job.The majority of managers were nice. The hardest part of the job is having to work all the holidays. But I think all retail jobs are like that. You are also mandated to work on thanksgiving and Black Friday.
good,This place has bad management.there is no more dress code. You really can not move around the company much. No real place for advancement. Discount sucks.
good,It is a bit stressful but the other workers are friendly. Management has gotten better of the years. Training is very extensive. Hours are flexible to a point.
good,"I felt that Cap 2 deserves a higher pay rate because of all the duties performed. Also wasn’t satisfied with the management , some were very disrespectful."
good,Needs improvement on how to treat employees and make them feel like an asset to the company. I was a great employee there but I never really felt appreciated. Management talks to the employees poor and sometimes we have to endure unfair treatment. I loved doing my job because I was good at it. The best part about Walmart is being able to help customers. I love helping people! If walmart came up with better strategies to cater to customers and employees it would be an amazing company.
good,"If you need a job Walmart should always be the first place you go to. They hire often and easily as long as you pass a Drug Test. I would consider it a beginners job to introduce new employees to the retail lifestyle. You'll learn Customer Service skills, General Merchandising, and how to deal with the daily struggles of employment."
good,"It's a Job, it serves it's purpose...fast paced and for the most part friendly.  Just in need of a change and to get off of midnight. The job itself is simple"
good,"the managers were not manager material, some where very rude. schedule did not give many hours to some of employees.  the Walmart probably made changes since I worked there"
good,"I loved the people I worked with. Cashiers and CSMs were all wonderful people that made the environment nicer. The higher management was always a problem, and the crazy hours made it difficult to have a life outside of Walmart."
good,"Empresa não valoriza muito o funcionário."
good,"I had a job I loved, and worked with great people, and had a good management team. Lack of a consistent work schedule was the reason I left or I would probably still be there."
good,Management is always trying to prove that they are better than you.  Co-workers are tying to make you look bad.  Management did not care about your health or safety.
good,"management was always rude.  Most of the workers did not want to be there.  If you could find a job in an area you enjoyed, it wasn't too bad working there."
good,"You can work here and it isnt that hard, but the upper management are not very understanding or helpful. For me personally the best part of my job was giving a little kid a cake and them being so excited."
good,"The longer you work at Walmart, the more it seems that management is committed to finding a reason to let you go, so they can hire a replacement at a lower salary."
good,You must be in management in order to have income to be able to support your family if you are a regular associate your  hours are cut and it's hard to have a living with minimal hours.  however the employees are great to work with it's a fast-paced environment the only real hard part about the whole job was the customer service.
good,it was a ok job just didnt like not having enough help when trucks were unloaded.. there were people there that had no respect for others and there was nothing you could do about it
good,"Long days as a salaried employee. Typically work 50-60 hours. You're scheduled 45, but your manager will look down on you if you only work your schedule."
good,"this was my first real job. i received no real training, the only training i got was on a computer. i was told i was doing things wrong, but never told how to do them right. most other employees were unfriendly. supervisor was never around and when he was he complained we were working to slow. on multiple occasions we were overloaded with work and had to put in 2-3 hours of mandatory overtime. their were multiple times i was blamed for some thing i didn't do or had no control over."
good,Management can't get on the same page. The turn over rate is crazy and you work hard for years and make the same amount as people just starting with the company.
good,"It was a relatively good job. The standard issues that arise from working in retail are of course there, (dealing with unreasonable customers, not having enough employees at any given time, apathy from corporate, scheduling issues) but the benefits were good and your hourly wage would go up every year as long as you did your job well."
good,Good atmosphere to work in for the most part I was there in a completely different time than it is now though. Different management and I am sure a lot has changed since I was there my job isn't even available now
good,My biggest tip for working for Walmart is to to be ready to work at a fast paste and ask a lot of questions so you can move up pretty quickly . Keep a smile on your face at all times and you shouldn't have any problems what so ever
good,"hard to get fired, but sucks the soul out of you. they say they hire from within,yet only promote the people that go along with the existing manager's opinions"
good,"A typical day at work when include customer service, inventory management, daily meetings."
good,Although it has been quite some time since I've worked at Walmart. At the time the management was less than up to par with favoritism and lack of direction and leadership.
good,"Walmart helps with social and customer service skills. It can be a fun workplace but the managers can suck. It depends on the store, how your walmart experience will go"
good,"Working there is like having the left and right hands pulling you in two directions.  Management will tell you to one way then change their mind three times before getting a straight answer. If you were to ask,""How do you what me to complete this?""   Everyone has the ir own way they want it done. Please get it straight people."
good,"In the pharmacy, a typical day at work is very hectic. We never have a downtime period to get caught up with work productive."
good,"I was an electronics sales associate, I enjoyed working with the customers and my fellow associates, but managers were often incompetent and there was little room for growth at the store that I was located at. The pay was competitive for this type of position and the benefits were pretty good."
good,"Walmart is ever changing ."
good,"A typical day at work includes tasks such as unloading freight trucks, stocking shelves, managing and maintaining the stock room, customer service. "
good,They preach family family but their not about you seeing your family. Managers do not work together. You have managers an associates sleeping together against policies.
good,"I prefer not to comment regarding this employer. However,  everyone has to go through the hiring and training process to elaborate on their own experience."
good,"I worked at the same store for three and a half years. I started out as a cashier and transferred to electronics in my last year there. "
good,"When I worked there I had a really hard time... Everything was fine till we moved to the new store, then they started putting cashiers as door greeters and just ignorjng us, one night I got my lunch 2-3 hours late. I also was fired because they didn't except my doctor's note from absences due to being sick from the chemicals they were using to redo the floors..."
good,Walmart has given me opportunities to grow within the store or to move across the United States. The problem is it’s very laid back to the associates but takes full advantage of the Assistant Managers and Store Managers.
good,"Walmart is definitely a place to work for, but there was constantly drama throughout the entire store. I can't say all stores are the same, but I will say working as a cap team 2 associate everything falls on your shoulders even if it's not your department. The pay is half decent and the job can be stressful, but it's not 100% bad. The management at my store was ok and my store manager was actually a really good one, but some stores have it together and some don't it's like that anywhere you go. Walmart doesn't offer a lot of benefits besides the ones they are required to give and you get cheated out of paid holidays which I'm sure that they are not required to pay you for, but most places do. It's not a terrible place to work for, but I personally feel like it's not a place to make a career out of."
good,typical day would include restocking shelves. Depending on how many trucks arrived it could be an extremely busy day. In addition selling fishing licenses would take some time depending on ho many people wanted to get one. The day would also consist of assisting customers find certain items.
good,"Typical days include a brief meeting and task assignment, followed by workers performing said tasks. Work is variable and can change hour by hour. The most difficult part of the position is the uncertainty associated with work expectancy due to lack of associates."
good,"The company puts high pressure on associates to succeed, which can be good, but does not pay enough or offer sufficient benefits for it to be worth it. Walmart management can create an unnecessarily high stress environment. Hours are often inconsistent and either extremely early or late."
good,"I was a cashier/Customer Service person.  I would help customers to complete their purchases and or return there purchases. I would do jobs out on the floor as well.  There was at least 10 management changes from the time I started to the time I end my employment with Walmart.  The hours were variable, never a set schedule. that was the hardest part of the job.  I enjoyed working with the customers, to this day 2 years later people say they miss me."
good,So so work place. Kind of stressful during the holidays. More of a job for teenagers looking for a little bit of hours. Unless you're fully invested in the company and you've worked there 10 plus years
good,This is a fast paced environment with opportunity for advancement if you have the right manager.. Although you work very hard you don't always get to share in the bonuses. No fulltime time status is offered. No overtime is allowed.
good,"The lessons that were taught on the CBL modules were not observed within the store. There remains an atmosphere of retaliation within the company. For example, if an associate called in that person sometimes faced having their hours cut. Or if someone used the open door policy, the gossip would spread throughout the store for days. And management made up the largest sorce of gossip. There was a feeling of managers gloating over associates failing or getting fired."
good,"Worked for about 4 years full time, then out of the blue all the full time associates in my department were getting below 26 hours for months. After talking with management the problem still has yet to be resolved"
good,"It's located in beautiful Penticton. Shift work can make it difficult to have a full-time family life but alternatively, there are some that prefer shift work"
good,It was a good job but the managers act that they are better than employees instead of equal human beings. They talk to employees with little to no respect.
good,"It was an okay place to work out even though I had to wear tan pants and a polo shirt under my vet. The hours were okay; however once they gave me $1 raise, they cut my hours."
good,Walmart is plagued with bad management which leads to much frustration. If you are lucky enough to enjoy the company of your co workers and pride in what you do it can be very enjoyable.
good,A typical work day consisted of standing behind the register and answering phone calls to assist customer with any questions they had. I learned how to adapt to different personalities good or bad.
good,Working at Walmart was a different experience. The management was okay but didn't pay much attention to those that weren't working. I liked the department I was in.
good,"Not exactly a career unless you put some years in and work yourself into management. Management had the habit of ignoring my availability, and scheduling me during times I wasn't able to work."
good,i was Thankful to have a job. i loved work on the register and conversing with the customers. There was not enough  money and hours. And no chance of be coming full time.
good,"A empresa em si é boa de trabalhar, só a política em algumas áreas que se pode questionar a forma como é feita. O ambiente de trabalho muito bom, e horário que dá pra conciliar com a vida pessoal."
good,It's time for me to move on.  I have had a lot of bad expeirences. I need a different job.  I was promised to move up to a Department Manager possition and was passed over several times. It's time for me to go.
good,"My time working there wasn't all bad but don't depend on anyone to help you with team lift cause everyone is busy doing their own thing. They want you to help people find what they need but then would tell you why you taking so long to finish your work, Smh real headache working there."
good,Worst management ever. No one could get along and everyone was only about themselves. I was constantly scoffed at for trying to do a good job. Jealousy was a real beast in that place.
good,Constant changing schedule and 99% of the time they won't tell you if they decided to change your schedule. Managment is also terrible and can be real bullies for no reason.
good,Walmart always looked for hard working people who where not lazy.  You had to work the hours they wanted you to work.  You couldn't pick your own hours.  There was always full time hours around the holidays.
good,"A typical workday would go pretty well, but every now and then you would have a manager that wouldn't listen to you or sometimes even interrupt you when you are helping guests."
good,"Wal-Mart was a fun place to work it twas stressful at "
good,The hardest part of working for walmart is that you have to deal with so many different attitudes from customers to co workers. The job isnt hard but its not for lazy people either if you keep a positive attitude and do your work the day will go by smoothly
good,A typical day at work was being pulled in different directions by different managers and being left to be the only cashier to ring customers on the front end
good,"This job is underpaid, understaffed and lack of morale. Customers was the only positive thing at this job. Management doesn't support you and could careless about you."
good,"When getting a job at Wal-Mart, one must remember that it is a retail job. Conditions vary with location. Managers, good and bad, come and go. I had a bad manager that in my opinion didn't ""represent company values,"" but my co-workers and customers made work more tolerable sometimes...."
good,I've worked for walmart for many years and have had a range of positive and negative experiences with the company. overall it was not a horrible place to work for. the only downfall is the amount of hours you will spend in those 4 walls.
good,Working Here was great at first but the work load was so demanding and it was very little reward. Walmart gets all the benefits and the employees barely get by.
good,Walmart is one of the largest employers in the country and it shows in ways that are both positive and negative.  Individual stores have little say in policy changes or sudden changes in standard operating procedures.  Jobs are being eliminated or drastically reduced by advances in technology.  Long time employees that worked in back offices are now being forced out onto the sales floor to deal with customers on a day to day basis.
good,"Walmart is a great place to begin working and even has great promise of promoting if your cards are played right, It's not what you know but who in this work place."
good,Wal-Mart is a great place plce to work IF you dont have a family. Depending on your manager you will really enjoy the work. Just be ready to do the projects they tell you to do 2 or more times in the same day.
good,"Fast paced work environment, Always busy working either with customers or cashiers. Management always trying to improve any issues as best as they can."
good,"Management is what makes or breaks a Walmart. However, walmart is famous for rotting managers and each manager has a different style of managing. Every couple of years you have to change your routine due to these rotation in order to make management happy."
good,"Lives the job itself. As fine went in, however, the supervisors became increasingly political. Associates who weren't as successful were flying under the radar, while I seemed to be overly scrutinized because I had a higher level of success. Lots of pass the buck, blame the next person in the culture."
good,"Most of the time it was great. I loved my co-workers. The management not so much. I got occurrences for missing days that I got approved for or because I left early to take my dad to the ER after he called the store to inform me he was having chest pains and I talked to the store manager and got permission to leave and still got in trouble over it. There was also a time where I needed a day off to see my baby sister from out of state that I only get to see once a year, they didn't give me the day off. The people I worked with were great but I think the management needs some improvement."
good,"Working at the Walmart was extremely stressful. They try to operate on bare bones crews and will not give you any help because they are not allowed by corporate."
good,You get good days and bad days as well as rude and very polite customers. The store I worked at had workers that were lazy and didn't want to do their job efficiently.
good,I only did this job for the Christmas season it was very busy fast paced I was very tired when I went home I didn't really li j e the job just wasn't for me
good,"Was able to sustain my self through school, was flexible in shifts and timing so I could study and still earn and income. Over all it was an experience where I had the opportunity to learn about the retail industry and how different sectors of business run ."
good,It was very slow and boring. And working customer support you have to deal with many rude customers. Coworkers and management was always talking bad behind each other’s bad and a lot of work drama.
good,Didn’t spend more time there but learned a lot there . My first customer service experience was taught in Walmart. The managers there are so professional and easy going . They love their work as well as the employees there
good,"was just something to get on my feet with , I did enjoy meeting new people working with others that was a great opportunity management was never really good"
good,Have to be fast paced and expect to work in other areas that you aren't assigned to. Our my share (bonus) wasn't much. Prepare to be a great worker and never slack.
good,It was the people that make you want to stay. the managers are not nice and I had a few personally try to make my time there harder than it needed to be.
good,"Always changing never consistent , great benefits, routines don't count because you are always fighting with freight from trucks. The hardest part of my job was trying to stay on the process because freight dictates your day."
good,Working for WalMart was okay. It is the store that makes you want to leave. But when you are working there is the people that really matters like your coworkers that  makes think about staying there for a long while others stay for the job to make ends meet and others like it there because they like to meet and see new bright and shining faces that makes the world go round.
good,Co- workers are friendly and very hardworking. 
good,Keep personal life and work life completely separate. Be mindful of food left in refrigerator - other employees have been known to eat others food. Be vocal in your opinion if you feel discriminated against.
good,A fast working environment. Have no problem with Walmart would work there again if needed . The part time shift isn’t bad . It is a little harder when you work 9 hours and still receive no benefits but in all it’s a good place .
good,"They work with your hours. "
good,"I would touch base with the off going associate to see how things are going and what is left to be done. I learned the proper way of selling firearms. I'm not sure what to say about management I've seen better and worst, enough said. I try to stay to my self and not get caught up in the culture of the place. The hardest part of the job was working with no personnel. I was lucky and got into a department I knew a lot about."
good,"Walmart, I've enjoyed some of my time there, but not recently. It's very easy to move up, but very demanding once you do move up. I've also noticed different Walmart stores are ran differently."
good,This is a great place for a first job. There are career options though it would require a particular drive to want to work there full-time for an extended period of time. The jobs available are not really all that hard though there can be times of stress when dealing with customers and managers.
good,"Walmart could be a great and fun loving job. but poor management makes it hard on everyone. Expect you to stay longer then your shift if someones doesn't show up or calls out like its your responsibility. Gives out to many task to one person and expects them to jump around different departments to help everyone else when your own area is struggling. Not enough people to help, if you ask anyone most people end up quitting because of poor management ."
good,Customer's are the most exhausting people and associates are a close second. I really enjoy my time with most but there are a certain percentage that can just massacre the most trivial tasks with their inability to understand basic logic.
good,"Typical work day includes you working in your department and about three others. Management is split, there are some good managers and some that are not so good. The hardest part of the job is being expected to have your department picked up while they also want you up front helping check people out and over in grocery helping."
good,Walmart is not a bad job by all means. I believe especially for people who are going to school Walmart is a great job. They work with your school schedule making life easier. The company definitely is a lot different from when i started 5 years ago. None of the positions are difficult  and it easy to learn and understand.
good,It is a stressful environment. Managers always down you throat and pushing you to do multiple task that one person cant do. The pay doesn't match what your job entitles. I feel they underpay.
good,An alright work environment with incompetent mangers. The employees were the only thing good about Walmart. Other than that the managers were a joke and the place was not that well kept. No one cares of how much you complain and the managers were pretty immature when it came to doing their job.
good,It was a fun and easy job but the management sucked. And they refused to give me hours. I loved how busy it kept me and getting to know more people.i would recommend working here if you love to have a slow job.
good,its fast pace and very competitive. I learned a lot and know a lot of stuff there. management was good and easy going. the hardest part is when they put too much on me. the workplace was fast-paced.
good,"A typical day at work for me is Coming in the morning, putting the load away, stocking shelves. I had problems with the Management at Walmart, i had flexible hours that i liked but i kept getting stressed out at work."
good,It’s a job for when your just coming out of high school and want to get out in the work world. It’s nice to talk to people/customers but from time to time you get a guy who’s just there to make your day hard but as long as you just do your job you’ll be good
good,"Typically, I am given a set of tasks from 2-3 different managers to complete during  the day, as well as tasks to serve customers.  During the day, most plans do not come through and I would need to prioritize based upon importance to service to our customers.  I have learned a lot about doing things on my own and take control in order to progress the business.  During  the time I have been there, I have known management to come through on what they say, though expect projects to be completed in a short amount of time.  Overall, working at that company has not been a good working experience for me."
good,Well I worked for walmart in 2016 and started out as a temp and ended a part time associate. For the most part if youre getting good hours you will work a 9 hour shift with two 15 minute breaks on clock and 1 hour lunch off clock. I started at 9.00 then went to 9.17 after like two or three months and then started working overnight so i ended with 10.50. If anything theres more drama between customers than co-workers if anyone is worried. I tend to keep to myself but if youre a cashier you will form some sort of work bond with other cashiers because you switch on and off to relieve eachother for breaks etc. Management will vary therefore proper training will vary but for the most part youll be prepared. Theres A LOT of computer training in the personnel room.
good,"Things I experienced when I worked at Wal-Mart may not reflect on how they are today. While the pay was may have been okay at the time for an entry position at part-time, opportunities for a full time position were scarce and working in a lower position meant handling 3 other employees jobs as well as your own at once quite often. There were hardly enough employees there, as well as a severe lack of communication between the multiple tiers of management, which often led to one manager being dissatisfied over certain tasks not being finished at the request of another manager to prioritize a different task. There were also many situations in which employees were pulled into departments they had never worked in before, and actual training to do the job was virtually non-existent aside from what was mandatory workplace behavior training. Benefits were decent there, but there were many things wrong with a lot of other things and workers were often not treated with respect they deserved. That said, in recent conversation with others who are still with the company, I have discovered that many policies have been drastically reworked for the better there, and I feel with the new starting pay, benefits, and restructure of how things are managed the company is a very different place than what it was when I was there before."
good,"The management at a the Walmart myself has worked at, the management was rude and unfair. the typical day was good at the beginning but the  end of the day was getting crazy."
good,"This is what I imagine the typical retail work experience to be like. You show up you clock in, then you go to a register and start working. Customers will be angry with you for things that aren't your fault."
good,"once was a great place to work for until they started cutting hours, cutting benefits, changing how they gave raises and changing your vacations hours"
good,I liked the people that were in my department. They were very welcoming to new members of the team. Half of the management that I dealt with I hated because they lead from the back the other half I very much enjoyed working with.
good,Time went by very quickly on the clock with the fast paced workload. Co workers and management are friendly. Customer interaction was fun and allowed time to go by fast.
good,Working hours from 4am-1pm took a little while to adapt to but overall my biggest problem was management. Management was very unprofessional and didn't care at all about listening to there employees ideas and problems.
good,Worked in all weather conditions hot sunny days rainy days and even in the cold freezing weather conditions but at this time in life i was young and dumb and didn't have a care in the world
good,"My original store changed store manager several times. Until the most recent store manger, management was manipulative and lazy. Everyone seemed to have their own clique and asking questions was hard because no one would get back to me. I transferred to another store because I had to move and it was even worse. My pay got cut by 70 Cents and they could not/would not tell me why. Manager doesnt follow standard operation procedures, and for whatever reason wont give me a consistent schedule. I work a morning, then I work a night, then I work another morning. Its easy if you follow SOP, but no one wants to and it makes everything more complicated."
good,"A typical work week, consisted of a constant cycle of encouragement and demoralization, building up to break down for the next week. Not an ideal, efficient, or comfortable way to work."
good,"management at wal mart is usually just a collection of people who have worked there a long time. no real qualifications to be a manager besides that.  unprofessional group of people, extending to regional management as well."
good,"Not really too much to say, it's Wal-Mart. It's just one of those jobs where you try to make the best out of your day and go home. You can advance but it's rare."
good,"Good company, promotes from within.  Always updating to keep up with the e commerce business. Has given me many opportunities and given me learning experiences."
good,Focus on taking care of the associate. Walmart strides its self on ensuring that the associate is taken care of.  Most fun part of the job is being ale to help others in the community
good,I loved my position and loved the people I worked closely with.  Management is non-cooperative.  Some are just rude with a bad attitude.  Points sucks
good,"I enjoyed the promotions available while working at Wal Mart. It was a decent place to work, but the pay was to low for an individual to provide for themselves, let alone a family."
good,"Most patients at this location were very cordial and appreciated the advice and service provided to them by the pharmacy. The main downside was Wal-Mart's Satisfaction Guarantee policy that often times would cause a conflict with state and federal laws regarding what a pharmacist can and cannot do on a prescription, ,especially a C-II."
good,They dont care about lower teir employees. Pay is not good. Hard to make manager. They favor customers over employees. Managers are often competent. Few are good.
good,Walmart is a customer serviced oriented business with many different job positions to fill the needs of each individual customer. the are widely recognized and have a great work culture.
good,The job place is ok. The store is somewhat organized but not quite there. But you learn a lot because you’re stocking different departments and doing something different almost everyday.
good,Opening store meeting with depth managers follow up making associates schedules teach and training new associates coaching by walking around customer service inventory management termination off associates
good,"When I first started the scheduling was great, I used to have the same days off for weeks straight then out of no where they switched my set schedule and now I have no set schedule what so ever. It’s even more annoying because we cannot have unpaid time off so if we cannot work for whatever reason we have to use our paid time off and you only get so much time. Managers do try their hardest to satisfy their associates (at least the ones I’ve had) but they can only do so much. And the staffing is way too low."
good,"Granted Walmart gives you 9 days in six months for missing work, the company should work with people that has been hospitalized. They have the option to accept doctors notes but it’s up to them if they want to accept them or not."
good,"I was ok doing my Job and while they pay wasn't good it was ok for what I was doing. However, there were too many chiefs every little sub-department manager would run over to give you an assignment and expect you too drop whatever your doing to help them. Got very old very quickly."
good,"Hours and rules are extremely strict. Some managers can be harsh and judgmental, others are sweet and helpful. Days allowed missed are extremely limited and benefits don't kick in for a while."
good,"A typical day depends on the department you are in. I was in the deli. The schedule was crazy. I could go from a morning shift coming in at 7 am to the next day coming in at 7 pm. I learn a lot about food preparations, juggling tasks, and teamwork. The management when I worked there was bad. I was in Deli but was dragged out of my area multiple times to do jobs I was not trained or qualified for. Lots of Drama. The hardest part of the job is trying to do more than five things at once. The most enjoyable part of working there was the long-lasting relationships formed with co-workers."
good,No comment. Walmart is the number one retailer in the world for a reason. They know how to get the merchandise to the customer. They strive for excellence.
good,"A typical day consists of walking into the deli and clocking in, checking who works today, then finding out what needs to be done, and doing it. That may be slicing meats for customers, cooking food, loading rotisserie chickens, cleaning, ect. The people are simultaneously the best and worst part of the job. Just like anywhere else, some people are friendly, pleasant, and overall good to work with, while others are not. If nothing else the job has taught me patience, something you need a lot of. You have to be able to get the job done regardless of the circumstances. In the end, it's a job and there's not much more I can say about it."
good,I felt my almost 9 years pf experience was used negatively against me..i enjoyed working with my associates the most...very stressful job to be in long term
good,"1. A typical work day would be we come in, have a team meeting and  get our assigned areas to work that night. You'd need to finish it by 4 am so you could store zoning your asiles in the store."
good,"Walmart Culture..."
good,"I find that Walmart is an okay place to work but things could definitely be better. I worked inconsistent hours, I rarely or never had the proper tools to do my job efficiently and properly. Management can never make up their minds on how associates should do things. The pay rate is good for a retail store."
good,Would only work there for one year or less. Not worth the stress for the lack of pay and recognition. Do not have steps to work your way up the ladder anymore.
good,"At Walmart, they give the impression that workers are not indispensable. You may get to work today and find out someone you worked with on an earlier shift had been fired or left. This gives the impression of lack of job security especially since they are non unionized."
good,"Work freight"
good,Poor pay for the amount of work expected to be done. The managers are also not very organized. I would not recommend anyone to work here who is not desperate for a job.
good,working at Walmart isn't a bad place to work just know there is a high turnover rate and being promoted is sometimes difficult. some managers do play favorites and the customers are rude and will treat you like youre less of a person than them. if you do you job and treat everyone well you will do fine.
good,A typical day in my job is being constantly busy at a fast pace. I've learned patience and passion is an important key to being successful in running a business. The hardest part of my job is having support from higher management. The most enjoyable part is being able to interact with customers directly and having a bond with many of them.
good,"Having had the opportunity to work for Walmart in two separate locations, it is the associates that make the difference. Whether in the backroom or the front sales-floor it is the associates that typically provide for a satisfactory work culture despite shifting management personalities."
good,"too much favoritism and lack of good management, don't want to continue a review, it would not do any good to anyone, the company gets away with a lot, don't really think corporate really knows what goes on in the stores"
good,There is never enough people scheduled so it is stressful. Its hard to give good customer service when you have to rush. it does provide good benefits such as 401k and health insurance.
good,"Working at Walmart is not actually as bad as you'd think. As a sales associate, you start out at a retail entry level. You spend a lot of time stocking items and keeping your department clean. Everything is really laid out for you and you get daily tasks assigned to you. It does not allow for a lot of room to make your own decisions, but you do get an hour long lunch and of course, you can take breaks as needed. Your schedule will not be a normal 9-5, and you can expect to work 7 days in a row. Also, you'll work holidays and it's required you come in on Black Friday, no matter what. I don't miss retail one bit! But Walmart was just like any other retail employer. The only big difference is that the turnover rate is extremely high and you'll be working very hard, probably going above and beyond your job description every day."
good,"The problem with the job was mostly in the management. The people themselves were usually quite tolerable, but advancement was often unlikely, and very rarely on the terms of the associate."
good,Loved working here good hours friendly customer's are department manager was a great understanding and kind guy. Didnt like the upper management to much most of the time i wonder if they knew what they where doing. Need better store and assistant managers.
good,Walmart was a great company to work with. They would understand n communicate wth the employees. Now they are very poor in communicating with the employees and the management can have their favorites.
good,"My job was mostly fast passed and sometimes stressful due to working with unhappy customers, but I learned how to keep cool when someone is yelling. The management was good, but not very personable. Walmart feeds employees well for lunches when requiring working holidays, which made it a little less hard to take. The hours were the hardest part of the job, even when there was a schedule agreed on there were still many schedule deviations that made going to school very hard."
good,"I was in management most of my career with Walmart. I worked in different stores and each store had a different atmosphere. Upper Management was hard to learn from, they were not much on teaching associates, but a lot on criticism. Hardest part was the schedule I had to work, not a lot of time for family. I did enjoy helping customers find what they needed and associates on accomplishing their goals."
good,"Looking to making a career not the way to go people are cutthroat. Management shows favoritism only for the people that kiss their butts, lacks communication ."
good,"At first seems more fun than work, but with fast moving changes you must be on your toes constantly to keep up or be left behind, good benefits fun people."
good,"Nice place to work{bakery}.... My manager at the time was great.."
good,Working at Walmart was an amazing experience. The work environment was very conducive and the worker treated you like real family.The work load was never that great you could relocate to any section of the store.
good,"The best part of this job in my opinion was the people I worked with. Overall the job was a little demanding but I never had any issues. We would unload trucks for 4-5 hours at the beginning of the day, afterwards we stocked the items unloaded."
good,Walmart saves you money but there are a lot of drama that comes with it. One time I saw a customer slap the Jackson Hewitt tax lady but the lady was about to argue back. Customers always complain about the alcohol policy which brings down the mood and lead to other complications. The atmosphere was stressful and negative everyday spent there.
good,"It was an okay place to work, they were really strict, I was pregnant  and had limitations that they didn't respect which caused me to go into premature labor and lose my job, but I liked the work and the fact that there were no distractions to slow down my work pace."
good,"Good for a little bit if you do good they ask for more and more , then you slow down and they get angry when you dont stay hard working constantly like no one has bad days , and management doesnt care about you"
good,"Walmart is an OK place to work for beginners, but its not set for long-term. All I Can do is learn about Stocking and not anything else if I wanted a different position and Management needs to work better on where to place people and how to accurately get things done on time and also needs to keep track of who does there work and who doesn't and also needs to improve on who to give different positions to others and how to schedule them. Also, work on better training."
good,A busy work place which teaches you time management and different work skills. Their number one goal is customers so learn patience and be knowledgeable of the store and its products.
good,Working at Customer service desk was very hard due to lack of training. The hardest part was each manager had their own rules on what to take back and were very inconsistent.
good,"The customers where wonderful. Most of the Front End Managers where wonderful. The Human Resource women was horrible at her job. She was to busy talking about other people than actually doing her job and she was trying to get people she didn't like fired. Also, there was alot of favortism among the older employees getting to pick what register they liked instead of rotating between employees like policy states."
good,The company is ok. Certain management needs improvement. They need to stand by their employees. The hardest part might the lack of communication. The fellow associates and customers were the awesome and the higher management needs improvement.
good,"This was a pretty generic summer job for a fresh high school graduate; 8 hour shifts with time for lunch and a short break, somewhat odd hours (6 to 2 or 2 to 10)."
good,Its OK I guess... But people aren't the best. Always blaming the new ones and no body is never around. Could be better hopefully someday. They need some changes
good,Changes  for merchandising is changing daily. Very high paced and stressful job. Lack of communication with Management. The computer based learning on computers should only be used for new associates or position transfers.
good,A day at Walmart was nothing but customer service. To make a person want to return was my goal. Making sure products were in the correct location was easy after figuring out the machines we would use for that.
good,The job is fast paced and overall is good training because of the fact that the job needs to be done every single night there is no break to the freight and every night you have to be ready for any challenges that arise like having a truck late etc.
good,"I liked working at Walmart but they could pay more and allow shift changes even during training to fit with what you have to do at home and how you get to work like for example, me, I left because my way to work could not get me there for the shift I was on and by company policy I could not have my shift changed so I pointed out."
good,"This company has wonderful benefits, and the work no matter your area is not difficult. The biggest reason not to find a job in this company would be that home office can decide there are too many managers and the following week you will be displaced. This accounts for all managment position, including upper salary. Ive watched some very good people lose their jobs in this fashion. If you are just trying to be an associate, its good, but attemping to move up is a very scary prospect."
good,"Probably the worst job I had, I would ask for a specific shift due to school and they would do the complete opposite, write you up for not coming or coming in late when already explained my schedule to them"
good,They ask for to much want u to do do do but yet when u want to move up they shut u down they don’t work with u on schedule they don’t care if u have kids they want u to work every holiday but Christmas thank god ur thanksgiving is there all day have to work 12 hours they don’t give u holiday pay they always ask for u to stay late but never let u keep the over time
good,It was fun working with people from different ethnic backgrounds. Working with the public is very interesting. The break area was fun for us associates got an opportunity to get to know one another
good,"We would come in at 10 pm, sit for 5-10 minutes talking about stocks and stuff about the freight. After then we would be told where we are working. I was never in the same place, always somewhere. I would go check my tasks, I would do the freight, then be told to go ""help"" someone else.. What I mean by ""Help"" is I would really be doing their job for them. They would probably go walk off or something stupid. No one would tell them off, but if I were to do that I would get in trouble.. Then I would have only 30 minutes to Zone my whole aisle before shift end."
good,Working at Walmart is a good people skilled job environment. I work in the deli department and it is stressful. You have to be able to muti-task doing multiple jobs. Also the management is terrible they don't really treat there employees like people. However the company does provide decent benefits and pay pretty well.
good,"Dept mgr's work hard as do some of the associates"
good,the people there are nice but your business will be in everyones ear if you allow it to be.  management does nothing and shift all work to workers. job is regular paced and sometimes stressful.
good,I liked working on the soft line.  You pretty much work by yourself. It would not be a bad first job. Not recommended for a career. No benefits unless you are full time.
good,Working as a stocker started off well but after a while not seeing eye to eye with management started making itself evident when you get blamed for things that you did not do. I am thankful for my time there but very happy I am not working there anymore.
good,They where Lier’s they bent the rules they had favorites managers where poor at what they do if you ask me Everybody under Walmart establishment is unprofessional
good,"Wal-Mart started as a great company with a great man.  The culture has changed in the past 15 years I worked there.  In the Houston area that i work in it has lost it's roots of ""Our people make the difference."" in favor of cost cutting and bottom line.   There are still amazing people that work for WalMart and I am sure not everywhere is like my area.  Company wide there as been a drastic cutting of jobs that typically contained long term associates and management.  I see where this certainly reduces cost in the company; however, I feel the company has lost a great deal of it's people resources."
good,Walmart is an okay place to work. Some managers are great and others are not. Great first job or if you are low on cash. I was at walmart for 8 years and the worked with me until I finally relocated to a different state.
good,"Typical day was hectic. Everything that you expect in retail like people issues, lots of call-ins, lots to do, not enough time in the day to get everything done."
good,"As a young person in college, most companies would be very proud to have you and would like you to move up their company do to the college experience. This however is not true. Walmart does not care about your education, they care if you are available to work 10 hour days for seven days a week or not. The management is allowed to speak to you however they want and your ability to move out of a department is slim to none. I've worked at Walmart for two years. They raised the minimum pay to 11.00. I now make the same amount of money as someone who just started their first day."
good,walmart has different people from different cultures working and i loved the job but the management kinda sucks. They would make the place feel like home for you
good,Totally has gotten away from why Sam Walton started Wal-Mart and Sams Club. Service to the Customer. This company is only about making money for the top. Employees are mere pawns.
good,Fun part-time job for students who are looking to make some extra money during school hours. They are very flexible with managing work schedules and you can switch to different departments.
good,"I worked in the pharmacy department."
good,I've worked for this company for almost 2 years ongoing. I've worked at 2 seperate locations in different states. The first store was one of the best stores I've ever worked for and definitely a great place to learn how to work at Wal-Mart. The second store is definitely a struggling place to work for. Not many seem to know how to do their job and I've had to step in and show people how to do task when they've been employed for longer than me.
good,"Te ponen hacer de todo aun q no sea tu área, el tiempo extra t lo pagan con tiempo"
good,"Walmart is a tedious and boring job. It sucks the majority of your time up and doesn't pay enough. I worked with some really great people while in Ohio but they all said the same thing. Walmart will take all of your time, never pay you enough, and give all the overtime to the managers."
good,"Over all I guess Walmart is ok depending on which one you work at (all are different) but you receive little to no training and many employees do not understand what their job is. One of the good things about Wal-Mart though is that, if you are willing to put in the work, there are many opportunities for advancement."
good,Walmart was a very stressful job and not fun at all. It was hard to get pay raises and no full time hours ever available. It was hard to get along with the different managers.
good,"I have been with Wal-Mart 17yrs. It has definitely been a learning experience for me. You have to be a people's person, but of course that's with any job"
good,"As an hourly it's a better home/work balance. It can be a little fast paced but overall a positive experience. The insurance benefits are so great, but dental and vision are great."
good,A good start job for teenagers. But I need a career that I like. It was a ok job for now but I want to move on to have a life career not just a job that I like to work at.
good,"El trabajo es pesado pero no te explotan, te dan desayunos y comida que tienes que pagar."
good,I must be honest and say that my professional experience working with Walmart has not been all aroun bad nor negative. I just wish that everyone would pull their weight and be given a fair chance.
good,"a typical day at work would be me cleaning down my register. then opening, having face to face contact with customers. I learned a lot about how the store works, codes. I also learned where everything is. The hardest thing about the job is dealing with rude customers. People who do not understand how the store actually works. I learned a lot of patience working at the job. I don't really attend any of the work parties or anything."
good,injoyed be with custmer and co-work but reading for a change. I would recommend the job to others but to know it is a challenging career  for some but it is a great to get experience with the public
good,When I started with the company the culture was about family and the customer.  When I ended my job it was only about money. The company did not care about the community.
good,"Started my day with cleaning assignments given to me by management. I learned how to paint and be efficient with the amount of work given daily. Managers are rude, unprofessional and do not appreciate the work of there employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with daily stress and a unprofessional environment. Loved to clean and make the store looked good."
good,It was Wal-Mart. I didn't expect much and I didnt get much. I was a part time cashier. I never even met the store manager. I did not get to choose my schedule.
good,walmart is a good place to start to learn about business politics. You can learn a great deal at walmart but the hours for management are very long and hard. days without lunches or breaks are frequent. 6 day workweeks are also a norm
good,Everything you have heard about Wal-mart is true.  Bad attitude in management.  Common attitude with management is shut up and get it done.  
good,"La dirección gerencial tiene diversas areas de oportunidad, no existe un equilibrio entre la calidad de vida y el trabajo"
good,Good job that will pay the bills and advance if you choose to stay there. Typical retail hours and the day flies by. Best for younger people starting out.
good,"As someone who has spent nearly 30 years with this company they have lost the focus on serving the customer, and are, even now, cutting their workforce to compete with Amazon taking market share.  If you think it is hard to find help now, just wait until their ""Customer First"" scheduling roles out."
good,"I like working with them because they have a place for employee which has tv, fridge, microwave and it has a friendly environment. They also enforce employee to get their breaks mandatory and they will really talk to you if they see in your time card that you have been working without taking breaks. They take care of their employees. I appreciate that one."
good,"Depending on your assistant manager, work could be either alright or a nightmare, same goes for your co workers, they come in all flavors. Luckily personnel rotation at Walmart is high, so you can wait out for the ASM's to get rotated to other departments. Advancement depends on how chummy you are with management regardless of skill. The pay is probably the worst part, near minimum wage, granted its not the hardest place to work at. Co workers can be a pain whether it be attitude or laziness."
good,"Typical day of customer care and food preparation was fine. The place was clean and we were given a safe environment. Management was always making time consuming and unnecessary changes and trying to throw people under the rug, often making more problems than they were solving. Store eventually went out of business."
good,"La empresa es buena,a veces lo que no funciona es la gente"
good,Management was poor but job was good. Fast but you can easily keep a good pace. They ask you to do more than just yyour job so it is a least something different from time to time.
good,"My job specifically at Wal-mart was very physical, so it was tough to get up and do this everyday. Management expects the unloading team to complete impossible tasks every day. Promises of advancement should be taken with a grain of salt. Pay is decent, but barely enough to live on alone."
good,Walmart as a company supports it's employees and provides adequate compensation and benefits.  The management at the Walmart I worked at does not support their associates and puts more work on fewer people all the time.
good,"I enjoyed working overall at Walmart, but management always came around giving the staff the feeling they could be released from work at any time. The hourly supervisors were there to lend a helping hand when you asked for the help."
good,"Typical day at work was helping customers running produce Department or helping out anywhere else, best prom day going home worst part of my day coming to work"
good,"Management only cares about themselves and after speaking to management about feeling unsafe in the workplace, regarding harrassment from fellow associates, their only response was ""try to get over it."""
good,"The work is honest, simple, and good labor. There are nice people in the work force, but there is a clique mentality in some of the work groups. Management is good at making sure work is done properly and on time, but often ignore the clique mentality of it's employees and a few of its managers."
good,its a good job vs a career i look at it as a stepping stone to where i want to be in the future. i cant live off minimum wage forever i cant myself here for too long
good,This was my second real job. I started right out of high school and it gave me some great experience. I left Walmart to attend school. When I returned from school Walmart hired me back on the spot. I advanced in the company as much as possible without becoming an assistant manager.
good,The managers were hardly around when needed. The employees didn't do what they were supposed to. They promote people who were a suck up and let the hard workers stay in their current positions.
good,"Great place, and fun. There is always an event or a preview that anyone can attend to learn.  They have many lunch and learn events with guest speakers and senior management presenting."
good,I enjoyed the people and the work environment. I enjoyed working in the toy section but there wasn't a great deal of value on teamwork. Overall not a bad place.
good,My first experience working retail.  Walmart expects a lot from their employees but pays minimum.  Managers are not qualified to be managers.  Online training.
good,Unpredictable overtime and some scheduling caused for difficult family schedule. The Corporate Philosophy was not carried out. The environment was negative and stressful.
good,Expectations are really high but the job culture is oustanding. You meet a lot of nice people who work there and that helps build relationships. The job is very fast paced
good,"I was a temp worker for the holidays. I told them that I was a student and couldn't work more than 25 hours a week, but I was ignored and I would regularly work more than 30."
good,"Walmart was an okay job. The hours were very inconsistent which made me want to find another opportunity. It was impossible for me to work 24 hours a week and manage to take care of myself, I'm glad I was able to leave and work somewhere else"
good,A day in the Garden department varied from day to day along with time of day. I worked with a team inside the store and outside in the patio or lot. I enjoyed operating the forklift and scissor lift the most. I'm skilled at it but I prefer not to run the register. I would rather discuss ideas and product options with the customers on the floor. Management was decent at explaining the days tasks and projects but they won't babysit anyone through it all.
good,"Honestly,when I became IMS Supervisor I felt I was set for Failure,that was back then,now,really dont know how it is,dont get me wrong,I had my good days when I used to love going to work and work hard,cause I felt I had something to proff,but at the end,Hard Work came to nothing,felt under appreciated."
good,The work is easy it's just when they start pulling you in 100 different direction it gets stressful. I havnt been offered health insurance and the pto system is ridicules.
good,"Production was tough, especially after going to 100% at all times. Any little thing can get you fired. Very good pay, however very stressful. Managers dont care about you and neither does the CEO."
good,"My coworkers are what make me stay. They're fun, enjoyable, and willing to help. Management, and their policy on schedules and their obvious favoritism, is the reason I'm leaving. Also, it's Walmart."
good,"A typical day on my job includes downstacking freight (fruit, vegetables, potatoes), filling the display areas with merchandise, cleaning, and culling the areas (searching for damaged fruits and vegetables). I mark some merchandise at a discount for possible sale, and create documentation for food being sent to Feeding America, a food donation organization."
good,The management it the worst they do not care about their employees. The pit the employees against each other and play favorites when it comes to promotions.
good,I loved my job at Walmart but when they found out I was expecting they started treating me different. They didn't seem to like a pregnant woman working there. My doctor put me on restrictions to were I couldn't lift anything heavy and they refused to work with me. They just sent me home. I missed to many days because my pregnancy was high risk and had complications. My daughter's now one and healthy thank the Lord. I think it depends on which Walmart you work for. I wouldn't recommend Cherryville Walmart as they aren't very understanding of real life problems.
good,"The hardest part about my job is dealing with rude customers, the most enjoyable part about my job is having nice co workers and having a team that can help you out."
good,The manager are all trying be the boss confusing the employees Thought it was a great place to work in the beginning but now I know better need better management asap.
good,"Empresa americana, cultura muito diferente a cultura das empresas brasileiras,trabalha com custos e mão de obra otimizados o que demanda agilidade e grande habilidade nas soluções diárias."
good,There are alot of things that i have to say about the company i was please as well as displeased with alot of things. I was hoping to move up through the company and have been there for a year not even a job offer for a higher position.
good,"I was a night stocker, a relatively easy job. You show up, put in your hours and go home. Almost exactly what I expected, a good first job. The only downside was that I was a bit slow at first, not their fault though."
good,You come in and  walk your departments and finish you notes and take care of the customers. keeping the lines down is a number one priority even if you have no cashiers.
good,I worked for walmart construction company. I built a regular walmart into a super center. The job itself was fun and enjoyable but it was not permanent.
good,"My manager happened to be stellar, but the company does not look out for its employees. They want you to put yourself and even your safety to the side and focus on them."
good,"Hours were never set, but I loved working with people. Especially the regulars. It made me happy to make them smile. I learned most of what I know about customer service and customer satisfaction here, and I feel it gave me valuable tools for life. The scheduling was the worst part of this job. Week to week, days off would change as would scheduled hours. It was frustrating."
good,"Good work environment for health and safety"
good,"Taking new prescriptions scan in to get image.  Take insurance and any manufacture coupons they had, validate and code prescription.  Counting pills and double counting controlled drugs.  Run register when customers come to pick up their medication. Hardest part was coding prescriptions. Mostly I enjoyed talking to customers and remembers faces and names."
good,Was working at Walmart a little over a year and it was a good job . Flexible work schedule works with you.  Just really bad management at the specific store I worked at
good,Always understaffed unorganized had three different managers telling us to do 10 different projects at a time pulled us from our department everday lack of communication abuse of power.
good,This company was a good company the culture used to be good the management used to be good until the great wave of change and then the company went down hill
good,Very fast paced and constant changes are being made. They say they care about safety but they push you over the edge to make their goals and will move you 3 times a shift to other areas. It’s ridiculous and not worth the $19.75 I made per hour. They’re currrntly trying to increase productivity although this building was a top 5 building and claim amazon and other competitors are doing it much better than we are. So they’re cutting our breaks among other things.
good,I met some  great people at Wal-Mart. The hours sucked half the time especially when the computer generated the hours and didn't get revised. Overall I guess it was ok...it gave me plenty of customer service experience.
good,"Nice place to work,however very stressful during holidays and during sesonal times, when have to change seasonal modulars, and not to have the rughgt people to work for you."
good,"Bem corrido, a trabalhar sob pressão e dando um jeitinho brasileiro, não é necessário trabalhar muito e sim amizade"
good,"It was an okay job but was kind of difficult to move up once you have hit management level. The pay grades have recently changed, making hourly management make less than what they deserve. Very busy environment and I enjoyed keeping busy."
good,Not much to say. Good luck. It is a crazy busy place. High demand and high stress. Company and management are rough...................................
good,those in my department were amazing is the assistant managers and up that made the last half of my time there the worst. who's bright idea is to have everyone show up on slow days but have me cover 4 departments from 5pm-10pm on weekend nights.
good,"As a manger with Walmart you have to give up your entire life.  Maybe it was because I had never worked retail but they have a monthly rotating schedule for management that has no consistency.  You only get one weekend off per month and only twoce per month are your off days together.  You could be working either 7-5, 8-6 or noon -10.  It really is awful."
good,"I learned several things at the store, customer service was the daily routine, management has their favorites, the most enjoyable part about the job was the co workers, the hardest part of the job was trying to do 15 jobs at once"
good,"es una empresa con mucho beneficios como las prestaciones de ley el trabajo en equipo, la buena comunicacion y"
good,"I was on the job for 3 months, responsible for backroom with out pay or title. The plus on that was learning very quickly. Worked overnight and that was a plus."
good,The people you work with at Walmart the majority of them dont want to work. So if you are a hard worker prepared to work harder than everyone else and for management to expect you to work harder for the same pay as the person that doesn't care.
good,Like the department i was managing but the upper management was bad. Not enough help to get tasks done in a timely manner. Only positive thing was their benefits.
good,unless you are planning on making a carrier in retail this is not the job for you.  its best for college kids looking to make extra money. i don't recommend  management they change rules constantly to avoid paying any kind of increase in wages
good,"Worked there for just over a year. Some management is ok, some are useless. "
good,It was the only job I could get at the time when I first moved to this state. The pay was not great and the work schedule changed daily. We were always short staffed.
good,"Mauvaise gestion, aucun pouvoir décisionnel de la part des employés."
good,"hard work days, can be very early morning or late night shifts"
good,"Everything is great when you first start off, then eventually the job gets very stressful, your hours drop, and if you are anything like me, they wont let you transfer, move in the store, and you don't receive your bonus, even though you work harder than anyone else. That's why I left."
good,"Even when you do your job the way they require you to, they still criticize and make you feel like a failure in all you do. Some times it seems that no matter what you are in the wrong."
good,Walmart is a good place to work I just feel that they need to treat all of there employees the same an equally. I feel like if there was better communication sikills that all employees will feel much better.
good,"worked there for 7 years overnight, was very hard but not as hard as working with a different manager every 6 months, that was very challenging, over all got to make new friends and meet new people"
good,I was stuck assisting many customers by myself while my fellow coworkers took long breaks or stayed in the back talking in groups.  When I approached management they acted like it was ok
good,"Walmart is one of those places that will leave an everlasting experience on you, from the customers to the managers that you have to deal with on a day to day bases. hours not full-time but part-time only so if you're looking for a job to have a decent income Walmart is not for you."
good,"I found that I usually was able to interact with coworkers in a positive way and the work experience wasn't bad other than a rather micromanaging manager. He tended to look down on the associates and talked to us in a condescending way more often than we liked. He was the main reason I left Walmart. Turns out he was fired soon after I left though so apparently it caught up to him. Other than that the only complaint I have is the massive understaffing. I understand that it was because of labor costs but the quality of service is reduced when two associates from electronics/wireless have to run Electronics, Wireless, Photo-lab, Pets, Fabric, Sports, and Home improvement, as well as answer the phone for the store; and this was a normal occurrence from 6:30PM-10PM"
good,"The CSM's were not appreciative of your help.  You just go in and get on a register, ring up customers and go home.  Management was nice and good to work with and fairly easy to talk to ."
good,So Walmart managers are mostly terrible. Often the ones that join on and never worked for them before hand are vastly worse. The one benefit is your Coworkers. You work together for so long it feels like a family. I still stay in contact with my old coworkers
good,"I did not really like working at Walmart, mainly because if you put any type of restriction on you availability they will make it to where you hardly have any hours or that is how it seems."
good,hard work fast paced some of the coworkers are hard to get along with. the job can be very dangerous i got hurt twice out  there and the second time they didn't consider it an injury
good,"Walmart started me out with a job, I appreciate them for giving me a chance to prove myself but the management was terrible here. Some of them were self entitled and didn't listen to any complaints or did they care. Very unreasonable with cut hours and no opportunity to move up, the last two years of my working there I didn't receive a raise. They always had some excuse even though our workers are very hard working and dedicated, most of the time it went unnoticed. You'll have to be lucky enough to find wonderful management that actually cares."
good,Worked hard for a job with nothing really gained from hours of 4am to sometimes over 1pm and on bad days 11am to 6pm were i would sometimes work 11 days in a row basically giving me no personal time and if worked overtime hours they would make me take longer breaks so it would cancel out the work
good,"The upper management was ok to talk to. The middle management, the person who visited you all the time was a very demanding person, negative and had no positive feed back. I was good at my job and I multi-tasked several duties. However I was never made to feel as if I ever did a good enough job for this one manager. I made friends there and the upper management was ok."
good,Come in find the night manager or team leader to see what areas that ypu will be assigned to. When finished help other co-workers complete there ares. Then sweep store plus make tags for new items or for lost or damaged tags.
good,I love working there I probably would still be there if they had better management. Walmart does a poor job with picking management so many people can same the same even at different stores.
good,Started off as a cashier. Being a cashier was fun. Being able to talk to the people was the best part. I was moved to CAP 2. CAP 2 will basically unload the trucks then go stock the floor.
good,If you can work in a fast pace environment and is willing to learn then its for you but if you do not like to work and can not deal with everything changing on a constant basis then this is not the place for you.
good,"Fast paced and repetitive. Learned a lot about stocking, baking, and cleaning. The management is okay, the higher up managers are great. Very friendly coworkers. Hardest part of the job is organizing the freezer. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers."
good,"I think that Wall-Mart  is not fair to their employees and they don't get treated the way they should for the work they do and the stress from the customers sometimes does not help if an employee or customer is having a bad day, but Wall-Mart can be a great environment at times when in the break room for a break which is great that Wall-mart does give great break and its like a time out from the stress of customers or in some cases co-workers"
good,Walmart was not the job for me. I did not find Walmart beneficial to me because i don't think i got paid enough for the duties they had me do and it was not flexible with me still attending high school.
good,"I did enjoy the job I did at Wal mart.  Had several good managers, but they change store directors to often leaving a feeling of stress among the employees.  At one time Wal mart home office really cared about the culture and their employees, sadly now that dsoes not seem to be the case."
good,"Walmart is what it is, a temporary job for me while i was in high school. Low wages for a lot of work. I did the best i could and helped customers as much as i could. Managers scheduled me more hours than i requested."
good,Lots of hours with payroll being cut every quarter. Worked for the company for 11 years and was bumped out of position due to restructuring. Enjoyed my time with the company.
good,"Ok job, pay was fair, but management is horrible and always on you, but at least they gave you 2 15 minute breaks and a 1 hour lunch, that’s the pro!!"
good,"Greeting customers, Making Sales, making sure my area is secured and remain locked at all times!suggesting sales changing watch batteries and band hanging out accessories. checking in jewelry, changing prices answering phones answering and responding to radio transferring calls.Making announcements throughout the store."
good,cool place to work.  easy place to work. management was very nice for my department. learned how to stock and tell when produce was good or bad. there were many different types of people that worked there.
good,"You have to be comfortable with working in a crowded environment. If you have any issues with dealing with many people at the same time, or being in a crowded environment, this place will run you ragged. On the other hand, the jobs not bad, a bit physically demanding, but pay and benefits are pretty good."
good,I enjoyed working with my fellow co workers also I enjoyed working as a team to get the task at hand done if needed by the task also was fine doing the task alone if it was also needed
good,Great Place to work if you have no personal life. you are replaceable so follow the rules  to a tee. employees at entry level are paid fairly and benefits are great
good,Was a great place for a career but recent restructuring has severely limited growth opportunities . Store level managers are great but Market and Regional do not offer honest feedback.
good,I personally didnt learn anything from this job it was regular day easy work for me to do in this company. I just feel the pay and hours should have been more.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at walmart. I was able to get forklift and electric pallet jack certified. I was doing management work such as rollbacks, price changes, clearance, orders. The staff was great. I only had an issue with one person who is the reason I left. Other than that, it was a great experience and I would love to work there again as management."
good,Walmart has the potential to be a good employer but consistently falls short in areas of communication and changing expectations of employees. Restructuring and new business plans are often implemented before they are ready causing a lot of stress. Answering to multiple managers at the same time often causes confusion. Trying to address a problem is difficult and employees feel that raising problems to management's attention may be detrimental to them. Walmart makes every effort to look good in the media but employees often disagree. Recently base pay raises and bonuses were announced and this did happen. But the restructuring of jobs and terminations was kept as quiet as possible. After 14 years with this company my hours were abruptly cut with no managerial explanation. This has caused great stress among employees and a lot of personal frustration as this impacted decisions and plans I needed to make.
good,"Poor hours, poor management, no opportunity for advancement, customers are really rude most of the time in the return dept especially if things dont go their way."
good,"You can learn everything you want at your pace, meet new and interesting people. You will developed a better customer service each day working there building your patience and tolerance to different type of customers."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work when compared to the pay of the competition (other grocery stores). They are willing to train you in several areas of the store. This is bittersweet because even though you are gaining experience in various areas, your hourly wage does not reflect your new skills and abilities. Scheduled shifts vary each week."
good,Clock in clean shelves talk to costumer and stock shelves while cleaning the area's you are in and helping other associates. Clean back room to standards
good,"The Assistant Managers can be ok, but one or two can ruin a store. Drive by management was the style of the two managers that i mainly worked for. They didn't ask what were the reasons somethings  didn't get done quickly, just barked orders and belittled employees because they felt that was the appropriate motivator."
good,A day at Wall-mart is like a day of work. You stay busy work your section clean constantly re-stalk your area and others but you will find others that don't want to do the work and leave it for others to do and goof off.
good,I liked working and staying busy. Helping customers is always funny.Hour long lunches provider a nice get away for relaxation. Plenty of room for advancement.
good,Very high pace retail with many opportunities for advancement if you willing to put in the effort.  Good health benefits and stock options.  Positions available in all 3 shifts.
good,"Typical work day can be stressful and rewarding, but typically its just stressful. The management only appreciates the work of people who have been there for almost two decades even if they are doing no work."
good,A typical day is not bad with the over all manager but the assistant manager sucks. I love my job but theres no room for much growth and no great payscale there. I love working on cars but I'm not thrilled being here.
good,"Very stressful, did not feel valued as an employee, lack of training, lack of understanding as far as the company goes, doctors notes were not accepted, etc."
good,"Job was great at first, but then management made changes in the structure of how things get done. Made it tougher on my crew to get everything they wanted done."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart but the pay is really low. This is a good job for those that are retired or going to college. The people were awesome to work with but some stores are ran differently and aren't as nice.
good,Overall company is a good choice to get a job.  But can be very stressful. Always changing structure which can be great or not so great depending on what is changing. They are always trying to stay ahead in technology and fair compensation.
good,"I really liked the people I worked with at Walmart. This alone made working for Walmart all the more tolerable. However, I did not feel like the pay was sufficient enough at the time, for all the work I had to put in."
good,poorly managed and customers had no idea what their prescriptions were and the price.  The training did not make sense.  Excessive politics within the store.    The staff was nice to work with.
good,"I enjoyed my time there. It wasn't fulltime, maybe 5hr shifts. The staff was friendly. I was only hired on to work over the christmas season when they were at their busiest."
good,This was not my first time working at Walmart. The management decisions lack common sense and create unnecessary repeat work and rush work. Their decisions also lead to greater work loads. Some of the salaried managers are great but more than half create a hostile work environment with how they talk to people and treat people. I will not go back again.
good,"Days were exciting, learned a lot about the company, management was awesome, the workplace was always live, hardest part of my job was when i was off."
good,"Very fast paced, keeping up with all front end associates and taking care of customer issues. I really enjoyed the associates. Management didn't really stand up for us at the end of my time with WM. Something changed at home office and the whole atmosphere was different."
good,A very relaxed place to work. I don’t think the compensation is fair at all even for those of us that have college degrees. A lot of promises were made at the beginning that were not kept. The environment isn’t very professional in my opinion and promotions seems to be based off of who you know and not by the value you bring to the role.
good,"Working at Walmart has more cons than pros unfortunately. While the benefits and pay are fair, the people who work there and management are often rude and disorganized. The worst part is the unknown schedule and the lack of sympathy towards illness. Any kind of illness is not an excuse to miss a day apparently. Overall, I recommend working somewhere with more stability"
good,As a cap team 2 Associate. A Typical Day consisted of coming in to work. Receiving a truck load of 2500 items. I learned to work at a fast and steady pace.
good,Management was hard on workers to get many things done. The associates themselves are great and friendly and often make the work day fun. Discount is hardly worth working there.
good,While you are employed as full time you are never scheduled more than 32 hours a week and they would get on your case about any overtime. You had to clock in and clock out right on the dot.
good,they had a bad habit of missing you 15 min breaks and even you mandatory lunch time
good,"A typical day at work includes putting together a cart to work, but being unable to finish due to being pulled to another area. "
good,Walmart was a great place to learn the basics of customer service and learning how to deal with difficult customers. It also taught me how to push myself to new levels on a personal level.
good,I enjoy working at walmart but I have an issue with some of the policies. I can see favoritism for certain associates which can cause problems. I love the people but the enviroment is not fun for me.
good,The customers always made my day go by.  I would have customers wait in my line only because I was quick as well as friendly.  I made sure that their shopping experience ended in a fun way or they at least left with a smile on their face.
good,"walmart needs to have more security and actually treat their employees better , when i worked there , there was much room for improvement, although have not been employed there for quite some time , so they may have worked on some things."
good,"My day starts at 1900hrs with a review of things that will need to be accomplished during the night. I spend the first hours out on the floor helping the customer and talking with my associates about how their day has been going, the up and downs they've faced throughout the day. The hardest thing about my job is when I have associates that call in that they can't make to work, now I have to re-adjust the different department that will  be stocked first and which ones I should move to the least important for the night."
good,"Be prepared to work long hours as management "
good,most of every day is spent asking customers if they need help and assisting them with their questions. sometimes your manager will give you special tasks to work on through out the day.
good,Walmart is a Great company to work with the benefits of working there are very substantial. I didn't learn anything I didn't already know. The management at the location I worked were not proficient. the job was pretty simple and working with the customers is always the best part of the job.
good,"The associates are friendly, you meet a lot of new people, some are repeat customers. Although, they have too many managers and not enough associates. You always got your breaks and lunches. Not too bad to work here, but they have their favorites."
good,"A typical job at work was very hard i was in electronics area it was hard to work the freight, take care of customers and secure all sorts  of items. i learned how to apply securtity  devices and take them off and to work harder than normal. taking care of customers was the easy part but applying security devices was hard because it was time consuming."
good,"Wal-Mart was okay working there at first, but after a while, I noticed there management and it made my job harder and more stressful than what it should've been."
good,"it was a great place to work for as far as getting new to meet new people everyday. Although the company itself was not very good, because managment was very rude never wanted to help when someone needed it and hardly any benefits.."
good,This place had a few flaws in it one of them being that they were really strict on their time policy. management was constantly giving you orders. customers were rude at times
good,I was told i was going to deli ended up in toys. Management at this Walmart is a joke and not worth trying to talk too. Stupid policies that land you in trouble anyways.
good,"Good entry level job if you need quick cash, but not good for long-term. The managers don't communicate with you and personnel will purposely hide information from you. They don't accept doctor's notes. They don't approve vacation. Above all that, the customers can be extremely rude and hostile."
good,I honestly would not   recommend this walmart job as a place of employment to anyone. I can not speak for other locations but I know that the location that I work at is full of managers who are unable to do their own jobs an blame the associates for their lack of bettering the store.
good,"Not much to relate.  There were many management changes,  few promotions from within.  Walmart prefers to hire outsiders as supervisors."
good,Walmart is a job not a career. It's good to get work experience but that is it. The management like to micromanage everything you do and expect things to get done in a certain time even when things go wrong that you couldn't control.
good,"The job isn't too difficult, pretty laid back environment. There is no advancement without a HS diploma (or GED) and a degree, but they have programs in place to help with schedules and grants."
good,Overall good place...coworkers were good to be around.  Some advancement ops but very little training was provided.  Would have been better if the training was better.
good,I started in the photo department. I was recognized by the Optical Shop Manager and hired in to be an Apprentice Optician. I trained and received my license while working there.
good,The job is not as easy as one would think. Pay increases were necessary to provide the company with quality employees. Hard work really does pay off in this company. There are plenty of ways to move up with the company. OR having worked in management at Walmart will look great on your resume. It is hard to have good work/home balance as a manager with the company because it is a very demanding job but it provides you with necessary skills to succeed.
good,Wal*Mart has grown into the massive entity it has by moving into areas and taking business from local small business owners. Good place for someone just starting out in their work career to begin at.
good,Typical day was assisting customers and getting product stocked. Learned how to interact with customers on a professional level and leadership traits. Management was always cut throat and very unapproving of over time. Hardest part unruly customers
good,I unload two to four trucks a day and put the freight on pallets and put them out to the floor and stock them Also helped any customer with questions.
good,"Its Walmart, the complain when your there too much and complain when your not there enough. They expect you to work double time for nonsense manager's, that have I personally seen at EVERY Walmart that are ""badge happy"" "
good,"Typical day was the same every day..  Punch in and report to work and go get carts."
good,"A typical day at work consist of having a meeting, going to your assigned area, stocking the product, labeling the overstock, cleaning and zoning the area. I learned if management knows of an employee having a technical issue, then management should address the problem instead of just writing the employee up. The workplace culture created a negative atmosphere because of management blaming employees and employees blaming each other because they did not want to get written up. The hardest part of the job is poor management which created stress and the foot pain, but the foot pain can be dealt with using Tylenol. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay, the benefits, and the pride of knowing that you are doing a good job regardless of the hypocritical atmosphere."
good,When i enter walmart i felt welcomed and look friendly when i started but after working their management treat you like your nobody and not solve your problems when they need to get fixed and they dont take the blame for their mistakes when they get themselves into a mess
good,"Wal-Mart used to be a great place to work. Now, it isn't so good. Hours have been cut with the new pay rate, so paychecks are smaller. There are no longer any regular, paid holidays, instead, all holidays go into the PTO category. You get PTO based on number of hours worked. 40 hrs/week gets you 7 hours of PTO per paycheck (you're paid every 2 weeks)"
good,"Walmart is a horrible place to work, management is not their for the team. they will go off of he say she said matters, they don't and aren't aware of hostile environment reports. the don't try to make work an easy environment for the workers they are just worried about cost."
good,"The company was ok to work for, even when I was promoted to another department. But...when you needed assistance in the department, the CSM's would take forever to send someone, even if it was just to take a break. The store / department manager would also cut your hours if you were not available when they wanted and would hesitate to even work with your availability."
good,"You stalked shelf's and what didn't go out you had to put in back stock."
good,Walmart is a very good company as a whole you just have your good days and bad days. it is a very good job for students. I just want to experience more than retail and try something different
good,"Walmart is a good place of employment for young adults beginning their careers. The pay is decent for young adults and teenagers however for adults with a family to take of, the pay is not enough as well as the lack of advancement opportunity."
good,"-Normally pretty busy, co-workers varied but normally friendly enough"
good,"The work place was alright but the hours and shifts varied to much, Flexible hours but really low pay. After the holiday seasons hour would drop to low 20 if not 16."
good,"Not all it’s cracked up to be."
good,"It was great experience working at Walmart up until the last year.  Integrity, leadership, and training has been compromised by new inexperienced managers with hidden agendas. Quality of work is poor and store numbers have dropped considerably.  Prior to their arrival, I learned a great deal about how to operate with management involving all store logistics and protocols. Workplace culture was exciting and I always learned something new.  A typical day consisted of apprehending shoplifters and recovering stolen merchandise, working with the police.  The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the chaos of Black Friday."
good,Woorked her for 3 years it was great to work. They people were amazing and a fun group. There was tasks to complete on time but also others were able to help if they had time. They have a great team ethic. I only left because I needed different hours for my family life.
good,I met some of the best employees while working here. Many times the upper management was horrible. We rarely had enough staff to cover everything that was needed in the store.
good,I helped a lot of people with there medicine needs.  I learned patience and understanding.  I had an excellent manager that was patient and helpful.  Walmart is a very fast pace work place.  The hardest part of the job was when we didn't have prescriptions ready and the customers would get angry.  I really enjoyed making the customers laugh when they are feeling poor.
good,It was ok wasn’t to good to work for the money they needed more pay to what I was doing which was stocking unloading the truck putting groceries where they go I also separated clothes
good,walmart was very stressful.no one was told to work together managment would not work with me.beceause i was smarter than they are.the place is for people that wants to get paid for not doing any work.and get away.when they where friend with managment
good,"I would start 5 am the o/n support would clock out. I made sure store was ready for business making sure all freight was complete,store zoned and clean. Then go to accounting finalize the day.I meet with management to check on staffing needs,associate issues.I also supervised  front end."
good,The people you work with and are in the trenches with are the ones who make this job worth it.  Spending as much time away from home as you do it makes it better to ahve a good team that battles for one another.  As much as Walmart likes to consider themselves a fair working environment there is a lot of favoritism within the company.
good,One of the three basic beliefs is respect for the individual. I firmly believed this and was behind the company 100% until they got rid of my position without telling me the criteria for letting me go. I gave up holidays and family time because I thought the company valued my contribution.
good,"Walmart is a fine entry level job for kids in high school or nice as an in between job. However, the management system is not the best in design. In places of little employment, such as the deli in most Walmarts, management does the bare minimum to make sure things get done, and then scold us for when something doesn't get done right or at all. Overall experience was fine. Nice people to work with, and some nice managers. However, on the other hand, it was rough being the only closer in the deli, which is a 3 man job, for the first 3 months of working there. And for the next 3 year, closing alone was a common occurrence due to the lack of staff and unhelpful management."
good,"Walmart is not the easiest place to work. Most times they will barely pay you what you deserve, while they demand and expect you to work like you are being overly compensated. It is my experience that no matter how hard you work, they will always want you to work harder."
good,I loved working there in the beginning. Management changed like the seasons and it became too much conflict. I had issues with time off due to my sons medical issues
good,"It's a great place to work for.  Sometimes they go through periods where they lesson everyone's hours but in a few months it picks back up. D"
good,sometimes customers are very rude but you just cant take it personel. another thing is that magament are not always there when you need them so it gets a little stressful sometimes because of that and because they are not good with scheduling so i was always working alone a lot which is at least a 2 person job.
good,Theres tons of pros and cons to the job more cons than anything. Other employees would agree. The pay is so good yet honestly not worth it. I dont see someone staying longer than only a few months thats if they dont get fired in the process.
good,i worked  in produce department stocking fruits and vegtables cleaning up spills  stocking was m y .favorite part of my job what i did not like was having to go in back at shipping  and unloading trucks part of the job i was never told about when hired
good,"I was in highschool at the time that I worked there. They were really good with scheduling me around school, games and everything else. The only thing is the pay was not too good."
good,Wal-Mart is a great job for newly high school grads and college students looking for experience. There is opportunity to grow in the company and gain leadership experience very quickly.
good,"This is a good place to work for your first part time job, I learned a lot of things about business and the importance of engagement marketing through my training at Walmart. However the management is very poor and it is a very favoritism type of culture if you are looking to move up."
good,"Management lacks communication between day shift, evening shift & night shift. Department managers are focused on the wrong problems. Good benefits for all workers part time and full time."
good,If you have nothing better to do than work in a disorganized retail setting and enjoy being pulled in 100 directions then work for Walmart************
good,"A typical day at work would be to go in in the morning, work, go on break and drink some coffee. I learned that the customers come first and you can't please everyone. The management had always tried their best but some didn't care to help others succeed. The hardest part of the job was learning how to sway your words to keep others happy, and even though there will always be drama in a work place you shouldn't have to be walking on egg shells all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job however, was the fact I made amazing friends along the way and learned how to handle customer service efficiently."
good,"started on 3rd shift, need the job, worked on 3rd for 3 mo. then got frozen department manager job. after a 2 mo was promoted to grocery department manager. usually very busy, worked alone most of the time, always short on help."
good,"Accepting a job at Walmart as a casheir doesnt always mean thats what you will be working as, if you are willing you can try almost any possition to grow your skills and advance."
good,"everyone i worked with was miserable. I wouldn't necessarily say it was managements fault, however the work itself is not challenging and can become boring and monotonous. I on the contrary did quite enjoy how simple the work was. however co-workers can be very immature and most people who work there a long time act very miserable. not the healthiest environment but it paid well for how easy it was."
good,Fast Paced Changing environment. you have to be able to adapt quickly and learn on the fly. management varies from facility to facility. overall i enjoyed my time there and learned a lot.
good,"You cant get throughout the day without speaking to your coworkers, and thats a good thing, because the people that work there are genuinely the most caring trustworthy people you will ever get the chance to meet. But... You need to watch out for management since most of the supervisors and managers would throw you under a bus for a 10 cent promotion."
good,The work was alright the manger yelled at people all the time. very little training the hardest part of the job was putting up with mangers that would cuss people out.
good,"Very poor management.  Did not feel like management had the employees best in mind.  Co-workers were good to work with.  Always had something to do, kept busy."
good,Long hours for minimum pay. To be honest I didn't have the best experiences working at Walmart but am glad I did get to experience what I could because it di make me a better worker and showed me how to respond to different situations.
good,"Wal-Mart used to be a fantastic company to work for 15-20 years ago. Now you get to work, do your job, and leave all the headaches at the exit door. It's a new day tomorrow."
good,"This place isn't that bad to work at unless you absolutely know you can and want to be in a better work environment and have been before. The management is quick to choose favorites even if you push yourself to work harder than others, you will not be thanked or recognized for breaking more of a sweat. Advancement is given to those who show they don't want to REALLY advance in life... just stay at this store for the rest of their life."
good,Walmart is a really fast paced work environment. Stocking was a really physically demanding job. The culture is really fun and upbeat for the most part but management is really pushy about boosting sales.
good,"easily able to advance because positions come open all the time, turn over rate is high, need to be a self taught person due to lack of training. did enjoy most of my co workers and loved my customers"
good,Management out of touch with what customers and employees need.  Poor scheduling puts undue stress on employees that must cover multiple responsibilities.
good,It is a fast paced environment. The benefits are good if you are lucky enough to get full time status. A lot is expected of you and schedules are not that flexible.
good,Es un buen lugar para trabajar y creser.  Te dan buenas oportunidades.
good,Relaxed but fast paced work. Easy going management to learn from. Friendly and respectful peers to work with. Able to build your social and character skills
good,"it was an okay job, but honestly the management was terrible and rude, and completely not understanding at all. they were only concerned about the job getting done and did not care about the employees being comfortable and safe."
good,Management have their days where they can be 100% helpful and others where they no help at all. Some choices they make are kind of stupid. Some mangers will listen to your thoughts and others will swear they right just because they are a manger.
good,"A typical day at work was the same as usual, go back unload trucks, and stock all night. "
good,We were production based and were expected to meet the production given weekly. I would say the I learned the accounting aspect of freight. Management was ok although there was favoritism. The hardest part of the job was the research that was to be done. I think the best part of my job was the flexibility.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart begins with your zones AKA facing the items on the shelves to make them look more full and organized. Then whatever your assigned role may be (mine being Electronics associate) I return back to electronics and do the same thing for the rest of the day. The management is a bit of a mess. Unfair treatment to scapegoating and different rules per manager have proven ungrateful to associates. The most difficult part of the job is having to tolerate management breaking rules and lying about policies. The best part of the job are the associates I work with, not the management. One important note is the sick days or schedule flexibility. I'm currently enrolled in college and working at Wal-Mart can often conflict with your school even after reducing hours. The sick days are very little as well, so you must use them wisely or you can be terminated. I feel Wal-Marts' across the globe aren't the same as the one I work at and I don't think Wal-Mart is terrible, but the store I work at could use some improvements."
good,Walmart was great to me when I first started but when the company was sold a lot of changes effected the workers and theirs lives outside of Walmart. The work life balance did not matter and the company started to cut positions that really made a difference in the company and put a lot more work on other associates.
good,"Walmart is really not your idea job, the managers are horrible, it takes them forever to solve a problem, management does not know how to address an associate properly, sometimes very unorganized"
good,I like most of my coworkers but the managers have no idea how to run the store they make stupid decisions that have no business to change when something works fine they go and change it and screw over the employees
good,"Hello, I enjoyed the diversification of the customer service. The customers were different and I enjoyed interacting with them. The hours were unusual"
good,"Overall, I like it some day and hate it the next.  I like the people that I work with and we all get along.  My department manager has thought me a lot about the store and the duties that goes into taking her spot when she isn't there so I can be her back up if needed.  "
good,"Walmart was a good place to work at but thats how i viewed because i was still new at the time, but as more time pass by i noticed all the racial slurs and treatment by management, seems like you had to be a certain color to them for you to show any more type of importance."
good,Was working with people that did drugs at work and would then proceed to work on customers cars. A lot of mistakes would be made and the managers know its happening several times I've gone to them and nothing is ever done. very stressful working environment.
good,"working as a cashier was a very good learning experience. However there are too many ""managers."" The majority are young and have no people skills. This is why its stressful. They want to talk to you like you're an idiot. It makes it hard to hold your comments to yourself."
good,"This job is a very people oriented job. Customers come in at all hours of the day and night and must all be given the same experience with our associates. If you cannot handle multiple questions at once, helping peolpe in a timely manner, or capible of providing service with a smile then this job could be a more complicated job. With practice and getting to know your store, helping customers will become second nature as you will know where most of the items not only in the department you are working in are, but as well as where other items in surrounding departments may be located. All in all Walmart is a good company for a starting job. The pay is cosiderably good compared to other retail stores. Management on the other hand, depends on the department you are assigned into or apply for. Some managers are more of a laid back professional whereas they are not as strict about how things are done. Other managers though are very by the book. They want things done exactly like they are descibed by corprate. Most are easy to get along with and will work with you in areas that you my struggle in that need to be done a diffrent or more efficent way."
good,"A typical day at Walmart is knowing that no matter what I never know what will happen next.  I have learned how to work with many different people.  The hardest part of my job is when I have to deal with a customer who will not be satisfied no matter what I do.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help people find a reason to smile, if even just for a moment."
good,Very stressful place to work. Equipment had to stay running. Never knew from one day to the next who was going to stick a knife in your back. Lot of two faced individuals.
good,I did not like this job. While my position sounded simple it was physically harder then it seems and I did not get paid enough for my work. Some of the managers were rude and no matter how much I asked they would not give me more hours. I will not recommend this job to anyone.
good,"Time goes faster as it gets busy ! but could be stressing at times, depends mostly on the people you are working with, could be fun and stressing ! overall productive and fun place to work ."
good,I enjoyed helping the customers but frequently found myself apologizing for the lack of service due to inadequate staffing. The challenge of keeping up a brisk pace helped me develop skills I never thought possible
good,"Es un puesto que te reta a mejorar cada día, exige honestidad y responsabilidad."
good,Many days would be packed with lost of work that kept us busy but was stressful in the expectations that were set when we were understaffed and under paid.
good,I love my job but it has it's ups and downs. I have learned a lot since I been here. I have been through many managers and some was good and other not. I learned how to deal with customers and my co-worker.
good,"I loved my job but was done dirty. I enjoyed my customers and my co workers. Management is all about themselves and their buddies, even if you are the hardest worker there, at least at store 1215"
good,"A typical day at work includes unloading a truck with approximately 2,000 pieces on it. You take the pieces that come down a line and put them in their designated areas. Once that is completed it is almost break time because it takes two hours or more to get this task done. Next, The carts of grocery are taken out to the floor to be stocked. The supervisor keeps two people in the receiving room to break down the freight that comes off of the next truck on pallets. We take the grocery from these pallets and sort them on carts to be ran to the store floor later in the evening. After our second break we pull all of the freight that came off of the first truck and place it in its designated area of the floor to be stocked by the night shift. I have not learned much from this job because it is just a basic retail job. I don't see much of the retail side because I am in the back doing physical work. I also feel I do not learn much because my managers are younger than me and are very immature. The workplace culture is not great because the people I work with all seem to have a sense of entitlement, and I do not like that in people. The hardest part of the job is probably breaking down the freight that comes off of the second truck because I am always chosen to throw the grocery. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting a paycheck because this is just another job like this that I have had to do to help get me through school."
good,I liked working there. I probally would still be working there if they did not let me go. I will probably go  back to work there if i get another chance to.
good,"The opportunities with the company is unlimited. You will learn alot about the business side, retail and learn alot about yourself. It all depends on you and what you want."
good,working at Walmart sometime fun but it is not easy in dealing with customers and some of the management team. I have been in Walmart for almost fours years to date  I never have problem with any of my manager or customer.
good,You come in clock in and start working any tasks that need to be completed and check in with co-workers who may have been there before you. Then do anything a manager tells you and work until the day is over.
good,Worked well when I was attending to have set schedule so i could accomplish a work life balance. The hardest part of the job is dealing with nasty customers.
good,"When you work part time at Walmart you never know what hours or day(s) you work.  You do accrue paid time off, but it is very minimal.  The hardest part of the job is not being trained by a person on the job and Management isn't always available when you need to resolve or discuss a problem. Your training is basically done by a question and answer online about the job through personnel.  I have learned to unload freight and place for display the stock and keep it orderly and run a cash register .  The most enjoyable part of the job is serving the public."
good,I actually enjoyed and would have liked to keep working in the position i was in but having bad management makes working in a place you would potentially enjoy unbearable.
good,"Ok place of work. No career advancement. Refused to retain me after I graduated college and wanted a higher.position"
good,"I loved working here. I would work here again.I enjoy fast paced and energetic roles, and if you do too this is the place to work. Love working in customer service this is the place for you you will get to see customers every day."
good,Walmart is generally a stressful place to work and shop because of its overwhelming popularity for buying anything in its industrial-size space that causes many tired shoppers to be fussy at cashiers. Walmart is extremely high volume products and customers that can make you feel less human and more like a robot too much in a highly demanding retail business.
good,"I'm not here to bash them because they really aren't THAT bad as a company, only as specific stores. It really all depends on you management team, and the associates you work with. As a whole they expect a lot out of you now just as an associate. I remember when it was a fun place to work, but now its just stressful. I was there through the whole transition of Sam's passing and how quickly policies changed. It was no longer about the associates, just about customers and revenue. I don't fault them, why get in business if you don't plan to make money? But take care of your employees. They are part of the reason you make so much money."
good,This is a good job to start and if you want to start being an manger this is a good place to start if you have have to right attitude and motivation. when it comes to the empolyees they are good hard working people how make the work eviroment fun and productive.
good,"Fast-paced environment which is required at Retail"
good,"*  I love my Job and the people that I work with,"
good,"Although politics got in the way of my advancement, which is why I left the company...overall the retail giant is a great employer!  Optical is fun and challenging with a clinical twist...unfortunately the opportunity to grow and move into Management is limited in this field."
good,the most enjoyable part of that job was the fast paced environment the constant movement. I also enjoyed being put on special project around the store and setting goals for myself to get them done above average. and I loved being a department manager and fixing problems in my store within a store.
good,There is a lot of favoritism working at this place and it makes life stressful on the job. I also think being yelled at by customers for something that was out of your control makes it a bit stressful. A typical day at work was checking out products customers bought. You have to stand on your feet pretty much the whole shift and breaks are not fairly given and some people who have disabilities were allowed to have stools but others were not allowed even if they had proof of a physical problem. The thing I did like was that you got to meet all kinds of people and learn different things about people that you were able to maybe use in another situation. The management was nice but again there is a lot of favoritism in this company.
good,"I stocked shelves all day"
good,"Walmart is a fast paced store depending on what part of town you live it. The store management differs, they are on hiring restrictions right now. Pharmacy technicians typically just stay in the pharmacy, we do help customers find over the counter products."
good,"Working for Walmart is not as bad as many others may say, but it is also not a perfect place to work. On a daily basis, we associates have a set of roles we are expected to take on, which can vary from completing a zone (organizing a section or department), stocking, or unloading a truck (which we do in the CAP Team). However, while we may have a set of duties to complete, we are often told to go outside of our ""normal"" position to complete those of someone else's, which often causes a conflict between supervisors and managers of different departments (one manager may tell an associate not in his or her department to do something the associate's manager did not tell him or her to do, for instance). Overall, despite the stress that often comes with working for Walmart, I have found it to be often fun to work here, as every day brings something new, and it is a great opportunity to build communication and leadership skills while collaborating with fellow associates and helping customers in need."
good,Everyone I came in contact with was very unhappy with there jobs. That made for a very hostile work environment that I could no longer accept working in the place.
good,They scheduled us for 32 hours a week so we did not receive benefits. Work was very hard and pay was extremely low. Manager at this site was great. He provided lots of company dinners.
good,"I did not like the fact that they don't give you an opportunity to work overtime hours.  In addition, I did not like the pay being only $10.00/hour.  I also did not like upper management there as well."
good,Inconsistent management Walmart adopted a one best way guide for store areas however store manager market manager regional varied from the program. Assistant manager training vastly improved. Fosters a family culture. Great place to work to learn a variety of retail areas.
good,"Assigned a register"
good,"Must be able to multi-task such as cashiering, stocking, inventory, helping customers, putting away returns, writing up damaged goods, lifting heavy items"
good,Its not a horrible place to work. As long as you dont mind the cold its ok. The money is great but the management has no concern for the hourly associates. I do have to say that the new head of the D.C. is trying to turn the place around by weeding out undesirable managers and trying to turn the place around.
good,"Must work fast, efficiantly and quickly. Do what you are tasked and finish with in your time period. Sometine work was hard to finish with just a single person but wont send you help"
good,A bad store manager she was always mean to people including mean and the associates were mean also had not enough employees at night to cover certain jobs
good,"Spent the majority of the day stocking, unloading, and organizing. Learned how to prioritize tasks and how to work around poor workers. Management suffered from a lack of communication and understanding of what is necessary for each task. Very high school like workplace with a lot of gossip. Physically demanding job but was not a bad thing. Customer interaction was key to the job and typically one of the most enjoyable parts."
good,Walmart is a large company with opportunity for growth and development.  There is very little regard for work-life balance.  Unless you are full-time there is no guarantee for hours which can pose a significant problem for many people.
good,If you like to work in the retail trade. And enjoy the fast pace of working. I would say you would like wal mart. The starting pay is a lot better then when I started.
good,"You remember those photo albums titled Wal Martians, Imagine working in an environment like that  8 hrs a day 5 days a week. Employees range from competent and enjoyable to Moronic and infuriating. I don't miss many people there, I had a handful of friends who made the work tolerable. The customers are sometimes appreciative of what you do other times they feel you are being dishonest and or intentionally rude."
good,I learned that I could do a lot no matter what comes my way & how hard the job is when you put your mind to it you can get it done. I learned how to make cup cakes
good,"I did begin working at this specific Walmart when it had first opened and it wasn't as great as I can see it is now, I was aware that managers were brought in from other locations to help build this specific location however, the heart of certain managers wasn't with the employees you could tell certain ones were there just for a pay check. "
good,"easy going, plenty of associate communication, friendly environment."
good,Eu gostava de trabalhar  lá mas era muito ruim os patrao
good,"Nice people, despite the age gap. "
good,"Not able to get required hours needed. Fellow employees are helpful,  Upper level Managers totally stressed out,"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of stocking freight, building features, zoning, making bales, helping customers, binning items."
good,"Wal-Mart would definitely be a stepping stone to when you are looking for work I don't look at it as a career, it got me in the door to learn the customer service skills to move forward."
good,Walmart would be a better work place if higher member of management would provide more support toward the associates. Coverage will have a large impact on making the customer happy. Wal-Mart should be a high paying job for what the associates work the produce.
good,Customers made everything better with the jokes to the pictures of children. Bathroom breaks weren't as easily accessibly and breaks weren't always given.
good,"knowledge of hand held device. knowledge departments, able to work at a fast steady pace. Must be able to bend and lift. Must be able to lift things above head. is a lot of repetitive motion required."
good,"Its an great job to work at, the management isn't the best. Its fast and slow paced; i liked when it was fast paced made time go by faster which was nice."
good,"Good place to work for few months,it differs from each walmart store as each store has different culture.If your store manager good,you can enjoy the job."
good,I wouldn't really recommend this unless you have long-term goals of trying to go up in the company and even than the make it really difficult to do so.
good,"Walmart has good benefits and incentives for its employees. The problem I have run into is poor management and support from upper management. The job is not difficult but the lack of planning, direction, and consistency can become very frustrating."
good,The job is pretty easy and the work load is consistent. some days you will get overwhelmed by work but with dedication it can be done. They do not tolerate excess tardiness  and will terminate you if you exceed their maximum number.
good,"My experience is what should be standard. Work well, but don't expect special treatment. Praise is nice, and opportunities should be available for those who demonstrate the an aptitude to properly take them. I decided to keep my responsibilities low at the company by choice, but moving is possible. Just depends if you care about business enough to have an influence at management."
good,"stressful at times, but good place to work. you have to want to work. management can be overwhelming and sometimes unhelpful. you have to teach yourself and be okay with that."
good,"Overall inconsistent, lack of communication, lack of proper management. Excessive pressure. Overworked. Lack of employees. "
good,the only two things i did not like was getting verbal abuse by customers when i had to check their receipts  and the fact that the company does not accept doctor notes for legitimate illnesses for sick days and they add a point to your work file so if you hit your max points you get fired.
good,The best days to work there were the ones where the mangers were not there and you can get work done without getting pulled aside for doing your job then being rushed because they pulled you aside
good,"As a manager there you are expected to do hourly associates work and stay until completed.  Associates get all the rights here, managers are expected to be slaves."
good,"Even though I have my problems, It was a job. My direct manager was out to get me I think. I liked unloading more than Dairy. It was stressful everyday."
good,Poor workers slow workers I'm enough workers not many days off minimum pay no vacation time unless you are full-time in working there a long time outdated training
good,"working at Walmart was a stressful job being the customer service manager, but i enjoyed working with my co workers.   there were to many employees always calling it so we were understaffed at times."
good,a typical day working at walmart was clocking in and helping customers greeting and ringing orders ..the most hardest part of the job dealing with rude customers
good,High turnover.  Constantly hiring.  Management seems to keep themselves separated from hourly employees.  Often implement new procedures but rarely carry through.
good,Working at Walmart is like when you get your first job. You need the money so you take the first thing that comes along. The managers care more about the bottom line than the employees. As long as you do your job and go home you will be fine.
good,All depends on facility you work at. Some management is great others not so much. Work can be great fast paced at times depending on the position that you are working.
good,Wal-Mart wasn't a horrible place to work. It was a good starter job for me. I was working as much as possible. I loved that you could pick up shifts when you were able to. You could work all over the store. I was a toy associate and then later transferred up to the front and was a cashier. I loved being a cashier. It was always interesting to see what everyone was buying.
good,"Good place for a temporary job, wouldn't work long term due to poor career advancement. Not much socialization or getting out from the register. Management is helpful."
good,"The good things about working at Walmart was they allowed you to take breaks whenever you felt it was needed. The bad oh where do I begin!  Low pay, poor management, seldom get raises, lack of hours. I guess lack of hours could be a good thing or bad thing depending on how you look at it. It's basically a job to just say you have a job."
good,"was in stock associate unloaded the trucks. The job is dependant on your co-workers as its a pretty boring job. If your co-workers are always moody you will be counting down the hours till you clock out. If your co-workers are fun, energetic, happy then you can actually have a pretty good time working here. I did it for two years unloading trucks picking and binning. The hardest part was throwing the truck especially if it was 2000+ pieces. Most enjoyable part of the job is pulling merchandise to the floor with a pump truck."
good,Pay is good for the job that I do. Can be treated unfairly. Required to have open availability. Required to help in other areas even if your own isn't  100 %
good,"I worked for more than one location and each of them and each position was different. It would be better if the company didn't always have temporary employees and made sure to give benefits to their employees. I loved my supervisor at this location, but I had different managers because no one stayed in the job too long."
good,"My Wal-Mart experience has been bitter sweet. As I have always been a very motivated person and strive for excellence when it comes to my work. It is very hard to balance all of the objectives that upper management throws your way. I am usually understaffed and have to do twice as much work as usual. Which is alright on occasion, but is very draining on a weekly basis. I have a production department (bakery) meaning we set-up and bake bread as well as decorate cakes. The sales for the department have been increasing since the start of me managing it. Although our hours and staffing has decreased. The co-manager and store manager always adding more to your existing work load which would be manageable if there was proper staffing. "
good,it was acceptable but the managers were real strict. and a bit disrespectful. the hours was tolerable. the work isn't hard but the the standards are challenging.
good,Don't go to work for walmart. It isn't a fun place to work if you go there you will not like it very much. It is a stressful place to work and if you don't know what your doing you won't get much help.
good,"It's a job. It can turn into a career; I had a seasonal position. the pay is good, managers suck and also show favoritism. either you have a life during the week or during the weekday, you pick though."
good,Job is fine. The management there thought could use some work. They're never there when you need them or anything. But it's whatever. Also they play around with your hours.
good,"Es muy buen lugar para trabajar , el trabajo es muy equitativo"
good,"Empresa muy importante a nivel mundial, pero la hace falta mejorar sus prestaciones y el trato con el personal"
good,"No store manager for over 3 months."
good,I neither hate or love Walmart it was what it was in a do what I needed in order for me to make a life for myself until I graduated college I appreciate it what it did for me but I did not appreciate what you did to me I probably will not go back to this particular company but at the same time I still will shop there if I need to
good,"Keeping a clean and organized work area and interacting in a friendly and positive manner with customers and associates. Not a hard job"
good,"Walmart was a decent first job, it didnt offer much in terms of longevity. The managers were not the brightest, and some of the employees were obnoxious. Wasnt a very enjoyable job, there was a lot of drama as well."
good,I enjoyed working at walmart. I was there overnight so I didn't do much customer service. My co-workers was lazy and unassertive. I did my work and theirs.
good,They tell you what to do then inspect the quality of your work.  Nothing.   What management?   What culture?  Stay working.  Getting   lay ed off ????
good,"It has been years since I have worked here. They have increased their pay which would make my opinion massively different. From my experience, it was whoever was the teacher's pet got to advance."
good,"I worked taking out trash & cleaning bathrooms.  Their point system is nuts; that's how I got fired.  How do I say it?  It was a job, I didn't like it but I got paid."
good,I believe everyone should work in this type of environment at some point in their lives. It builds character to be able to put up with customers that really do not care for your store. They just want to get their stuff and go. There is a lot to learn from this place.
good,Management does not communicate with team enough. Hours get cut all the time. Lack of new hires. However certain managers do help associates with personal issues.
good,"This store has very high standards as far as cleanliness goes. We are required to keep the shelves well maintained and the whole building very clean. It is a stressful job , but there is also pride in your hard work."
good,Great place if you like sitting all day at a desk. A lot of office politics and backbiting. Management was rarely helpful. The lunch breaks were too short.
good,"A very work orientated company."
good,This was a typical cashier job. I checked customers out when they were finished shopping. It was fast paced and there is a certain amount of items you should be scanning per minute. The other employees were mostly friendly but there were not many hours offered and I did not make enough to support my family.
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart for a cashier involves going on your two fifteen minutes and one 30 minutes to one hour breaks very late because your fellow workers are selfish and your manager is inconsiderate.
good,"Openly culture, friendly work environment with continues work task to keep busy. Good human resources with paid time off including major holidays. Open shift availability with an employee discount."
good,"It was fast past place to work, that I enjoyed. I liked to work with the public and get to know people that were in my community. I enjoyed working in different areas of the store as well. I always liked to stay busy ."
good,"Walmart has a productive working environment. It has opportunities to advance as a Walmart associate. However, it does not offer financial support or stability. I constantly worry that I will not meet my financial responsibilities and I feel as though I will soon end up in debt and with poor credit due to the insignificant amount of money I make working for this company."
good,"Direct customer service helping customers decide whether quality and certain choices would suit their needs. Cash handling, doing multiple transactions especially during the holiday seasons."
good,"Great environment to work in but also depends what dept you work for to truly enjoy your job "
good,Management was inconsistent therefore getting my coworkers and I mixed up instructions. Typical day consisted of me being thrown around between two departments according to my managers even though on schedule I was listed as something else.
good,Very easy job that did not require a lot of thinking or skill. There were multiple occasions where they would send you home early because they had too many people working.
good,"12 hr work days, three breaks, steady paced job always on your feet. No ventilation always dusty, break room was never cleaned I’ve machine always broke"
good,"For this store, its too new to have an extablished culture> i enjoyed the work for the most part and the shifts. Hardest part could be either getting up at 330am or the drive in bad weather"
good,Hard work with little reward.  Heavy lifting required along with unreasonable time tables to complete required duties.  Workplace was fine with lots of nice people.  Good job for a young person.
good,"I enjoy working for the company, they give me benefits and they are very flexible with hours. A typical day at work for me was to simply ensure the cleanliness of the store and to report to supervisors of my work and to ask if any extra tasks I can perform to help the team out.I feel the hardest part of the job was communication. Which is important in both management and associates alike. The most enjoyable part of the job is I always had something to do."
good,"This was a very stressful job. Late hours. Rude managers.Constant issue between employees, I do not ever see myself working for this company again. Impossible to get your breaks"
good,Walmart is a good company to work for when you want career advancement they will help you get there if your don’t need a set schedule because it is retail and they are open everyday of the week but if you need stability Walmart would not be a good fit
good,I really have much to say other then I liked my coworkers and the customers were what you would expect overnight Walmart shoppers to be like. I just didn't like the time that I worked and tried to move to days but the management was kiddie poo and wouldn't let you move so yeah. It's really not as bad as people think.
good,Overall unloading a truck and stocking the shelf sounded easy enough but when it came to reality it was insanely stressfull certain mangers will pick on the ones that stood up for them self and keep at it until they get reasons to fire then with me I had a back problem and I couldn't come in a couple of times so the let me go
good,Worked on all 3 shifts.  The work itself is nice and the day to day 8 hours goes by super quick because you are always busy.  Overall Walmart #1175 was a great environment.
good,"You tend to stay in one position for around 4 years before a higher position is offered. I have been in the same position now for 8 years now and have yet been asked or offered a higher position. I have trained vigorously to obtain some type of advancement and still to this day, no luck."
good,I been work there for 3 years I was happy that because hiring me for second chances interview hiring me I was like it until no good place for me I am not happy
good,it was ok i dont have much to say good place to work is safe and the people that work there are very divers.  starting pay is good and was within a resonable distance from my home
good,Anyone who's worked or knows someone who's worked at Walmart knows how the place can be. They fired people to replace them with temporary workers from agencies.
good,the overnight managers are amazing people and will help you if you have any issues or don't understand something. I wouldn't recommend this job to somebody under 25 only because it will be extremely hard to make plans with your friends & Walmart can and will try to make you stay past 7
good,Overall I enjoy many things working for a company like Walmart. I worked many different positions and never felt bored. I did feel like they appreciated my hardworking. I feel like that my ideas about how to make work more productive we're ignored.  I feel like I have advanced as far as I would want in the company. Management seems like they are just there to collect a check. That isn't what I want for myself.
good,Local indicado a pessoas que buscam uma oportunidade para emergir no mercado de trabalho.
good,I like to work there and a typical day was to replenish the store and work as a team to help do so all while giving good customer service for the next business day
good,Did the job of 2 or 3 people yourself.  The manager at the time would not help certain people.  I heard it is better now that that manager is gone.  Just make sure if you have issues to document and document to protect yourself.  Good luck!
good,"Great place to work. Since we have new store manager the store is different more changes, firing great workers  other than that it's easy to move to different positions. I went from maintenance to shop back/ cashier to a stocker"
good,no review do not have a review. The hardest part of job is the stress because you can never do enough. The more you do the more they want. A typical day at work Stressful!
good,"It was okay. Our head cashier was so slow. I worked in the evenings and as it got later, only a few registers were open which was frustrating. Walmart as a whole need more evening cashers and more than one head cashier working at a super Walmart."
good,"Order filler environment cold, fast-paced, & work quota has to be  filled each day before you leave. Employees call in on holidays which makes workload harder for workers that come to work & receive no consequences."
good,"The pay is good and that's about all. No holiday pay. No Lunch breaks, Don't care about associates. Always looking to coach associates for something. Always taking away benefits from associates. Good place to work to pay off bills quick but not for a career."
good,"A typical day a WAL-MART  was waiting on customers, this is a fast-pace environment. The work culture needs to be improved. They need to treat their employees as good as they treat their customers. The hardest part about working their not my manager but the other managers that overseed the store. They would talk about their employees in public."
good,A typical shoot day. Dad is made his wife drag him him mom is stressed out  to get the perfect shot the teen age boy is like dad and dose not want to smile the baby is crying cause he just woke up and you have to make every one smile need I say more .
good,"Walmart was a draining work environment, physically and mentally. While the pay was well above average, the company felt unorganized. However, Walmart is a good company in the sense that they provide many advancement opportunities, and are willing to work with their employees to create a schedule that works for their schedule outside of their work life."
good,"I recently work at Wal-Mart. I enjoy my job and being a manager. However, if you are not apart of the Wal-Mart clicks than it is hard for you to advance in this company. I do not consider myself apart of any click, but I am a hard worker and do what I'm suppose to do as a manager. The benefits are great and if you get with a great assistant then you are sure to succeed. I've only had 2 and I've been with Wal-Mart for 4 years."
good,"I will keep my opinions of the stressful magnitude people are put under.. New management didn't know how to treat or communicate properly with employees or customers. From my experience and knowledge from being there she should not of been management of anywhere. That local business in that area, has went to a worse situation since prior with no actual store manager or previous store manger."
good,Some workers are friendly. Managers are ok an understanding. Job I had was easy.  .      i loved helping people when they would ask where something was
good,"Working at Walmart was okay, nothing to special. They were flexible with your schedule and had good pay. Most of the managers would expect you to finish more work than you could handle and some would passive-aggressively insult employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers. My personal favorite part of the job was getting free donuts on Fridays ;)"
good,Working here is quite difficult. It is a cutthroat environment as anyone trying to advance must step on everyone else. While you are trying to get your job done asset protection prowls around looking for a reason to reprimand you then fire you. Try not to work here if possible and if you have to keep looking for another job.
good,"Environment composed of 3 pharmacists, an excellent team lead, 4 technicians and 2 cashiers.  Two of the Pharmacists  which I work are very willing to assist with training,.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the workload and what has become a bit chaotic with lack of enough staff to handle increased work load.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the diversity of the work."
good,Being a cashier was enjoyable although at times we did not have enough cashiers and customers got annoyed. I did not like it it when I transferred to a sales associate because they expect to spend all your time putting away stock and customer returns instead of helping customers
good,"Although Walmart serves a great service to the community by offering things at a lower price than their competitors, it is a poor work environment when the managers do not communicate with the employees are not friendly and DO NOT TRAIN."
good,"I have seen in many cases, that there are employees at Walmart that are under-paid for a job that they are more than qualified to do. Although Walmart is a billion dollar company, they are more than capable of paying their employees enough to be able to live off of."
good,"good place to work I loved it there you will love it to, good managers as well as good people. fast moving job never bored and you always recive all of your hours"
good,Whatever your task or job function that day stay focused keep a steady pace work safely. You need good people skills and and be able to work well together as a group or by yourself
good,"My job duties included unloading trucks, stocking/facing shelves, and helping customers as needed. It was a fast-paced working. I enjoyed working with all my coworkers."
good,"Walmart has a lot of great things going for it as a company. Its frontline when it comes to innovation, and leading its way to  the future. However Walmart does not take good care of their employees. As a salaried manager you are told your job is the only thing that should matter, not your personal life not your family. It is really sad since family is what Walmart was built on."
good,This company will provide many work hours. This job is good for anyone seeking an opportunity to be employed. Make sure to advocate for yourself and you should be fine.
good,"at first, i had my schedule with the hours i would work. not even a week into working and my schedule was changed. the manager always told me to start a career with them when in reality i just wanted to work for the money (save up for college). they would make me leave the register just to translate someone or do other things that did not involve the register. i was never given my breaks/ lunch on time."
good,"A typical day was non stop and productive.   Some management teams were very involved, and some let you manage your business.   The culture was very good and involved depending on the team you were on.   The hardest part of the job was providing results to all management levels.   The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you were providing a service that help so many customers."
good,There were many time where I had to multitask as for the customer service desk was always busy. My co-workers and I would come up with different ways to split the responsibilities to be able to get it all done in between helping customers
good,People can learn a lot by working there. How to deal a work with costumers and also how to work in there position. working here was a great place to meet people.
good,"Was a great company and felt I could make a difference. Transfered to Ft Mac upon a promotion. Was great till they brought in a new store manager who liked to threaten jobs over positive affirmation to get results. Broke all rules in regards to stocking, rotating and saftey practices. Many racial slurs behing office doors. And a overzealous jealousy toward any other staff and management appreciated more by the staff. What went from a dream job making it a better place. Became its own reflection of the video ""Walmart High Cost of Low prices"""
good,"Walmart was a good paying job, but had a bad work/life balance. They tried to suck the life out of you as for as energy level. Not much time or energy left for your family. Poor management-Grocery store type management-not educated and very reactive"
good,"Es una de las empresas donde puedes comenzar a desarrollar tu estabilidad y récord laboral, al igual que no ven las capacidades del personal, contratan personal con poca experiencia o sin idea para puestos de mayor jerarquía que ver la capacidad y desempeño en uno perteneciente a la empresa, es una de las empresas que menos respetan sus políticas y en la mayoría de los casos el favoritismo a ciertas personas que otras."
good,"very stressful work place, you can barely get a break and the work load is unbearable. There are no room for ad advancement and you put that on certain days you are not able to work and they over ride your availability"
good,"I have mixed views on Walmart , it is a very fast paced environment as cashier especially on weekends. As cashier you learn to be more responsible with money and handling cash. My con is on this specific location is that management needs to do a better job at protecting and respecting the values of their workers and their safety."
good,"This is a place to be if married, starting as a working stepping stone in a teenagers life, or you are retired from another profession. Not all stores are run the same some are much better than others; it just depends on the stores management staff."
good,"Relaxed place to work with typical work day of 9 hours. Learned to take project ownership here. "
good,"A typical day at Walmart is not bad.   I would go in and work freight, finish early, and help out others where ever needed.  I would take my time to train other associates whenever they had a question, and was often relied upon with difficult tasks."
good,good place to get job experience. would recommend for someone looking for a long term career. pay isnt all that great but good people to work for.worked with really good people
good,"Management was not good, but it was a good job depending on your position and financial desire. I worked the deli, had to be fast and pay attention. Still a good experience"
good,i would recommend if needed job and cash. The work load was outrageous for the low pay. It was unloading trucks and stock. I personally didn't like it.
good,I leaned  to work on the register and I enjoy working with all my coworker the fronts end supervisor was great to work with and help when needed the work culture was fast and the customer was great the hardest part of my job was when we needed more cashier' the most enjoyable part of my day was when we all get along to make the day better
good,A typical day at Walmart for me was checking out customers. Asking them if they found everything okay. Occasionally I would do carryouts for customers if items were too heavy.I wouldn't say there was a hard part of the job because it's basic responsibilities but seeing how customers react nicely to you was the most enjoyable part of my job
good,Working at Walmart was a good experience but you do not have a personal life. Walmart does pay well but you have to have good shoes and thick skin in order to work thwere because the customers are demanding and rude.
good,"decent job. fast paced, got to move around, help customers. guaranteed your breaks. pay could have been better! management had terrible communication."
good,"Walmart has good benefits and a nice work environment. I enjoyed working at Walmart,  I love working with the public.  My job as customer host was easy for me because im always smiling, being attentive to customers and making them feel welcome. Being polite ,curtiuos, and energetic comes natural for me.  I do my best at whatever job i am working at."
good,"Not a terrible place to work initially, but the job becomes mundane and soul sucking very quickly. Very Anti Union culture. Rigid policies, unorganized. Back stabbing coworkers"
good,A typical day at Walmart consists of Balancing the cash flow and researching the shortages from the day before. And maintaining the customer service desk for returns.
good,The typical day can be quite busy.There is a lot to learn and a supportive team.The hours can be quite variable.The hardest part was learning all the products.
good,Wal-Mart was trying to keep all associates to part time in order to not have to offer benefits. Hard to move up due to the amount of people already waiting for position openings to come available.
good,"Working at Walmart isn't bad if you don't care about how people treat you. Working throughout the day, managers will treat you like nothing, and not care."
good,days were 14 hours plus and many incompetent personnel occupied the floor. A day would involve morning meetings with managers and then with your group. Start up meetings were quick. I learned to work well with others and to trouble shoot on my own without waiting on others. I learned how to maximize my presense on the floor and manage my time in the office doing paperwork. The management were tightly knit and demanding. Results were sometimes unreasonably expected and the building was well beyond its capacity which was unsafe but not focused on. The hardest part of the job was the 14 plus hour days. I loved the group I had the pleasure of working with. Well mannered good spirited and competent.
good,"Not a bad place to work, but too little is paid for the expected work load.The managers are fond of just using employees, no real concern or care for the associates."
good,"A typical day is helping cashiers with anything that need such as price checks, exchanging change. "
good,when I worked here it was through the holiday season so it was stressful and fun all at the same time.. met some really great people and had an overall good time working here
good,Wal-mart is a great place to work . The smiles and laughs that come from customers & workers are the best. But they should really enforce discrimination and retaliation from managers & co - workers because employees don't mind working just how much u put on one person then expect them to be done by a certain time. And yes I was Sexaully Harassed. This one guy was like 60+ calling me baby and trying to mess with me but I talk to a supervisor and he did not care. So I left .
good,"Can be a hard place to work, very very physical lots of very heavy lifting, the annual Evaluation's are not fair, everyone receives a 2% raise, no matter how hard you work, even the less productive employees."
good,working at walmart was a very hostile and stressful workplace. They do not care for you or your familys problems. (Ex. kids getting sick). my hours were never consistent
good,"There are definitely some good people. Except the odd snarky coworker. Especially during a afternoon rush, always be on guard for the long lines of people rushing in. Also that one angry coworker who tries to get literally everyone fired. 😂"
good,"The biggest problem I had was they kept throwing me around. They hired me on as an overnight cashier but I told them since I was in school I wasn’t able to do overnights and the interviewer told me they would get it fixed they just needed to hire new people, they never fixed it at all and was throwing me around everywhere doing different tasks and it just wasn’t working for me. No one was willing to help find a set position after many time a of me asking, even during my days off."
good,"Management is for the majority primarily concerned with things non-related to their employees. Very little hands on job training is provided, and frequently new policies and procedures are not communicated to the full staff.  This results in a chaotic, unsuccessful workplace."
good,"Although the pay is nice and there is room to grow from the start you are given so little in terms of callouts that you will be punished for even trying to get time off for an injury or illness. Having to wait 6 months to be given some breathing room is frustrating, and if your management is bad then it can lead to volatile job security. Don't expect any leeway if you have sudden medical complications."
good,Management is disrespectful at Walmart. Most of the employees are pretty easy going and helpful. It can be a very fun place to work at times. Can be very stressful to work here.
good,Typical day at work was pretty laid back which I enjoyed.  The hardest part of my job was performing the same tasks over and over again.  The best part of this job was the flexibility of hours and working time.
good,"Wonderful work place, bad management, unprofessional workers, strict on policies.. Love the customer and the energy every day brought working at Walmart"
good,"I learned a lot and did it for 15 years but it was more about family and helping people in the beginning, but changed over the years and only cared about numbers in the end and could  care less about the associates now"
good,I learned a lot about what I needed to do for my job. The main thing I did not like about my job was the management. Sometimes they were the nicest people and other times they were the worst.
good,All the people that work for this company do not hold its values to hear. Everyone is in it for themselves and no one truly has anyone interest in mind.
good,depending on the department is what decides whether you'll keep the job or not. the pick mod location is very strict and requires you to run but are not allowed to run. They have favoritism.
good,"Walmart on TV is nothing like the actual store. Maybe it could've been just the one I worked at. Too many managers and Assistant managers trying to fight for overall authority. As a truck unloader I was lied to about starting pay. I was making the same amount as a cash register associate but worked 4x harder than anyone on the floor. Not to toot my own horn but theres no way anybody should work that hard and receive no recognition, a raise, or even a simple balanced work schedule without all of the managers complaining or threatening to fire you. One more thing. The store owner supposedly was a nice guy that you can come and talk to yet he was hardly in the store. No one including other managers could ever reach him. I honestly felt that i had no one to go to talk about the extreme working conditions. I wouldn't recommend making Walmart a career. Maybe just a job for a quick check."
good,"Not very flexible on decisions or work hours"
good,"Wal-Mart was a great opportunity for me. It was just a seasonal position for the holiday season, but I definitely met some great managers and employees during my stay."
good,"Very stressful job within this corporation. Most workers do not apply the Walmart statement or actions as their employee, most are rude and do things their Own way not Walmarts way."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart is definitely an experience, as with any other job, it has its highs and lows. You basically interact with a plethora of personalities. There are little incentives, such as employee appreciation celebrations. Specific managers do take time to guide you when necessary.You make the experience what it is."
good,If you are not amount “the click” you don’t get treated fair. No chance of advancement if you you are in The Click. There are worthy employees but they are held back because of assistants
good,"Fast pace with many tasks.  Very poor areas of rest.  Short breaks.  More diverse food.  Uniform and shoes should be provided by company....They do not  want to recognize that it is very tiring, exausting job dutiesand it is a requirement to be always at your best customer service behavior regardless of the very nasty customers words ...It is also important to have a lounge at almost every where for employees with comfortable massaging chairs."
good,Walmart is no longer a company for the blue collar work. It cares more for profit than those of us that are not perfect. If your not perfect your not wanted.
good,"For me in my department, the workload was heavy but adhered to a task list.  Certain deliveries would come in around the same times and we would work the rest of the stock depending on that schedule. We would also do other tasks that most regular associates would not be doing, such as setting up stock displays and ordering merchandise. I learned how to work in a team and how to teach others how to carry out their duties.  Management was very lax at this location and the blame would more than often fall on the associates rather than the management.  The hardest part of the job, in my opinion, was trying to get everything done within the workday.  There were even times where I would willingly skip my breaks in order to get more work completed.  However, most of the time, that would prompt me to leave work earlier to make up for the lost break.  The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people.  The return customers who know you and are familiar with the store, as well as the associates who you share the workplace with.  Their friendliness helped me stay in that job for over five years."
good,Walmart is a good job to get started if you just a beginner in working while more and helps you get communication skills customer service talking listening skills confidence it's a good job to start off with.
good,Staffing is just bad the managers dont care about there empolyee . We was always short staffed and sometime  hours got cut due to it. There was never any thank you for staying over to help with being short ect...
good,All the leadership is now out in California for the Technology organization.  There is minimal opportunity for those in NWA.  JK an ML are rapidly changing the culture of Walmart in Technology
good,"Walmart is what it is! Start here dont finish here!! Use walmart for what it is and move on to your life goals if you have any. At the end of the day leave walmart at Walmart and last but not least have fun every day, customers on top of management will take your insanity!"
good,"The job was ok, spent a lot of time speaking to clients and handling money. Would not have given up my position had I not gotten diagnosed with breast cancer. I wasn't there long enough to really get a feel of the company work culture but from what I did experience the employees were happy for the most part."
good,I worked at Walmart during my high school years after school and on the weekends.  I did not think that it was a very professionally run place and the management were not supportive.
good,"A typical day consisted of running the register for several hours, interacting with hundreds of customers, and carefully conducting transactions. The management was decent, though I don't believe that there were always enough managers on duty. I quickly learned to be patient with customers, and I mastered the 'customer service' voice and facial expressions. I perceived the workplace culture as tense, but somewhat positive. The most difficult part of the job were the long hours on my feet, rude customers, and frequently finding myself covered in mysterious sticky substances. On the other hand, the most enjoyable parts of the job were the pay, and frequent interactions with my coworkers. There was a sense of solidarity between workers."
good,Very hectic. Too much drama between employees. VERY unprofessional. Disrespectful employees/ managers. Lack of communication. VERY unorganized. Not enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at Walmart was to get the store in good condition, take care of the customers and work freight. Keep the department area you work in looking good and shop clean for the customers experience."
good,"More or less Walmart is a stressful experience, at least mine was. We were always understaffed. It was a fun environment to work in, but some associates try and get you in trouble as much as they can."
good,"I learned a lot about business and myself even during my time of working for Walmart. It's a great place to work if you want to learn about the business world and how cut throat it can be. However, if you're looking for a job where the pros out weigh the cons, then this is not the place. If you're looking for a job that will support a family, don't bother with this place. Not to mention, if you're a parent, there is so much you end up missing with your kids because of the demand the expect from you. I would suggest working at any retail store only for students that are trying to work while starting their life. Or for elderly that just need something to do."
good,"Fast paced , up to date work technology, always room for advancement. The company provided good benefits and various work schedules to provide associates a variety of options to fit around life schedules."
good,Contrato de 3 meses ( primeros pasos ) muy buena experiencia laboral
good,Decent place but would not recommend it. Very unhappy employees and understaffed. Poor communication within the warehouse. Disorganized and unkept work area. Timekeeping is too strict and almost impossible.
good,"I love my job, because I love people and interacting with customers. However, Management is grumpy and show favoritism. I can not work late anymore because of a change in my personal life and it is like pulling teeth to get a change in my schedule. And yet, they hire new cashiers and they are day and weekends off. My Manager, has been great when I was sick or have a Dr. Appt, but the scheduling is where I have issues."
good,Fast pace and stressful in every way lots of staying late and finishing other peoples work unreal expectation and needs more help qith little payrolll
good,I loved working for walmart I have always enjoyed retail just some of the management took nothing in consideration whether u had children or were very ill
good,It is an easy job. The people you may work with may be a hassle but overall there were good employees. My work schedule didn't correlate with my school schedule very well.
good,"Job advancement should be based on experience not popularity. The hardest part of the job was being in the coolers, I enjoyed the daily routine not being the same."
good,"Every year I worked for this company they took more and more from the employees and put more work on them with less help. It is definitely getting worse. Inconsistent scheduling and hours lead to lacking Paid Time off time, which is only vacation days and personal days. Not sick days."
good,Walmart was a good job at first.  But after a year into the job i started to see how overwhelming i can be to work here.  i woke up on work days dreading the job.  wish i could say good stuff.
good,"I enjoyed working here with all customers and most employees....The customers are what kept me coming back I enjoyed being able to help them."
good,Very quick paced work I learned many different things to aid in work related advancement if possible.   Management was poor and needed more education on ways to treat employees. Nice culture.  Hardest part was short staffing everyday and not enough time.  Most enjoyable was other associates and knowing you did your best to help customers in the time you had.
good,"I'm needing different hours so I can be home at night with my 3 kids.."
good,Walmart will have you up at all times of day. From early morning to early morning. Children don't matter to management. Your life needs to stay out of Walmart. Management does not appreciate hard working associates.  Focuses on the bad. Don't close your availability. You will receive little to no hours.  Most days Management will have you up and down all day. Will except you to complete daily routines to a tee even if you are schedule alone.  Managers will promote the most unqualified associate for supervisor / lead.
good,"the only problem i had with wal mart was that i requested to work later hours on the days my son had football games. i really enjoyed working there, and wished i could have kept my job. i pointed out after i was told i could come in at one in the afternoon."
good,One of the best company's to develop skills in Asset protection. Workplace and workload varies from store to store depending on management and support staff.
good,Wal Mart is a good work environment but the managers don’t really work and make a lot of money doing nothing the associates should make more especially tire and line techs because we work on cars which in other places the make a lot more than we do we are responsible for the lives and safety of people
good,Pay is good. Job is stressful. Disability company they work with completely sucks. Managers are not great. Most associates are friendly. Job is fairly easy and not hard to do if trained properly.
good,"look elsewhere for a career, good as a stepping stone only. Management wants no responsibility. People are good to work with. it's getting worse by the day to work here. It's easier to get in and out of a prison than getting in and out of here. As the old saying goes ""He who trusts no one can't be trusted"" applies here"
good,decent work place but break room was shabby and the hours were decent. the employees were nice but management wasn't the most effective for the cashiers.
good,If you want a job then apply but it wasn’t the right job for me. I just want to work at a place where I can be trained and just do my job and Walmart wasn’t the place for me
good,"Job is interesting and fun, work colleagues are great and fun to work with. salary is pretty low, not many benefits, job sometimes is slow and lacks work."
good,"Walmart is a hard company to work for.  They put a lot on the department managers to complete daily.  On top of that you hardly get any help from management, so everything falls on you.  They also do not allow overtime, so every week you have to rush to finish on time."
good,"There isn't really much I can say that was good about working at Wal Mart. There are some really good people that work for Wal Mart, but unfortunately they don't have much of a chance to succeed."
good,"Job was constantly demanding tasks performed outside of the job description. Personally, the amount of waste the company tosses is crazy. The manager would say shoes are worth more as trash than as an affordable $1 and would cut up perfectly usable shoes with a box cutter, hundreds of them."
good,"La empresa funciona gracias a la gestión de múltiples áreas lo cual permite y ofrece que quien trabaje en ella sea una persona multidisciplinada, le imparte el conocimiento de cada área y mantienen al personal en constante labor de distintas índole brindándoles la oportunidad de hacer carrera en ella."
good,"is an ok job lots of favoritism among management.. schedule shifts are working late till 11:30pm then have you schedule for 6:00am start. "
good,I have experienced a great deal of challenges since I have worked at Walmart.  I now have the knowledge to know what I want in my future career.  A position where I am challenged everyday.
good,"It wasn't bad but I wouldn't go back. Always non-stop, and management always watching. Not alot of choice when it comes to hours and impossible to ask for a change, at least for me."
good,"fast paced work place, a lot of work nightly. friendly workers and well respected employees. Friendly environment."
good,It is nice working at Walmart.  They have everything you need in the store.  I was proud to say that everything was in stock and organized at the Walmart I worked at.
good,"Friendly, good place to work. Never bored, lots of variety. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping and interacting with the customers. The worst part of the job was the hours."
good,"Greet customers as they arrive at the deli counter / section and inquire into their purpose of visit"
good,Great company to work for if you have the right management if not prepare to work your butt off. In my time I've been with walmart they have made great strides in training but still lack enforcement of the new ways as it seems like a power struggle over old and new are happening.
good,The people made the environment better then it really was. Could never get enough hours and they are always changing things that never had any problems
good,"This was my first job as an overnight stocker showing me how the real world works. At Walmart it was hard balancing life, school and work throughout my one year there. I had learned a lot during my time there and believe for those coming into the working environment should start with Walmart first to learn how to work in retail. I was a part time stocker for majority of my stay as an overnight associate for schooling purposes."
good,"I loved working there because of the public people were friendly and some employees. One boss was helping me get an AM position which made me extremely happy. However, can not eat on the floor even when you need a snack like a snickers which got me in trouble then got mad which lead to termination. That manager should of just looked away and stop brown noising to get ahead, later on she got fired."
good,"The co-workers of the shift prior to mine didn't do their jobs, instead of cleaning up a bodily fluid mess in the restrooms as we were trained, they left the mess to dry and closed the restroom until our shift had begun. The co-worker assigned to me was lazy, and thought he was the boss and acted like it, made no sense at all."
good,"The work pace was super fast, the management team expected a lot with little in return.  I liked it when we did fundraisers.  I learned as a manager how to appreciate associates."
good,"I started with Walmart as a Sale associate and promoted 6 months to a Department Manager. "
good,"My average work day I go in at 5am and leave at 3pm."
good,"Vendedor de piso, acomodo de mercancia , planogramas"
good,I really like working at Walmart but when I transfered from Cleveland to Toledo it was very weird. Cleveland was very professional and Toledo really don't care about the costumers.
good,It was a very upbeat and pleasant  work place I would  recommend this place to work for young kids to work or older people  that need a easy paced place to work
good,"A typical day in the pharmacy is really busy. we have to answer phones while we look for patients information on the computer. input information in the system constantly. Answer question for the patients or regular customers. Fill prescriptions, talk to insurance call doctor offices."
good,"Pues es depende de la administración cuando yo entre  me gustaba mucho mi trabajo pero con forme pasaba el tiempo te exigían más por menos"
good,"It was a tough job with a lot of stress and a lot of yelling. The schedule was fixed, and the hours were intimidating. It paid well, but the tolerance for error was low. I didn't like the yelling from other employees, and it happened daily."
good,"It is a high stress and fast paced environment where competition is encouraged and an open schedule is required. You never know your schedule until the week before. However, in house promotions are encouraged and training is great and mandatory."
good,"Bons colegas de trabalho, sempre me deram suporte no que eu tinha dúvidas, gerente arrogante sem paciência"
good,Working at walmart you have an inconsistent work schedule which makes it difficult to know exactly how much you make each month for bills. You also don't get paid enough money for the amount of work they expect you to do. It is a good job overall if you don't really mind the money but they could DEFINITELY improve.
good,I did enjoy working for Walmart the place was stressful and walart is not as congllamerent as you would think the manegent played a lot of favoritism but there some good people
good,"Walmart of Guntersville Management was at a crisis while i was there with our store manager gone and everyone rushing it was chaotic, but good people there who will help you out when needed."
good,I would not go back to walmart because the mangment was not very good even when you have a medical emergency. I also didnt think it was enough pay for everything you had to do
good,"Low salary wages, good workplace, bad management, good co-workers. "
good,"Work wasn't hard or complicated and pay is about even with the work you do. The management team however was lazy, unhelpful, and played favorites, praised incompetence and ignored anyone else"
good,"Walmart is an average place. When I had my experience working with Walmart, it could be very unorganized at times. The workplace had a great amount of benefits."
good,"management is in different directions causing confusion upon all their workers, there is no work/family times, only work. I had to teach and train myself as well as my associates. I did not attend any training for my position and felt like no one knew what they were doing."
good,"I was a cashier at Wal-Mart until I found something new they was a great company at first, but they don't care about the employees at all. I would recommend everyone work here if they would like to but its better jobs out there"
good,"Too much drama and disrespectful management majority of the managers on my team are new so they don’t know what they’re doing which makes our jobs more stressful , and they’re very rude when It comes to addressing their workers"
good,Depending on who the store manager is is how the store is run. The store I am in has a store manager that is demeaning and retaliates against anyone who challenges him.
good,Its ok for a part time job with low pay. No benefits for part time and do not hire full time often. Very busy work and very stressful. Some opportunity for advancement.
good,Wanted you to work full time hours on a part time basis. Meaning no benefits but you're working 40 hours a week. Then they want you to take an extended lunch when you pass 40 hours so they don't have to pay you overtime
good,walmart is a big company so youll always have abjob but they pay was pretty low. i did not like working third shift people i worked with were ok short breaks
good,"Very high-paced, continuously on the go. Semi-relaxed/competitive workplace culture. Over all good management within the department. Opportunity for advancement in allowing work among the different departments."
good,its work if you needed but dont make a career out of it. cutomers belive their right like always and managers have no idea what their talking about. the store is not like a family as they portrait its a company so keep your head down and work and youll be just fine
good,"A typical day at work, could go from fine to chaotic quickly. I learned how to deal with angry customers and to remain positive in the face of a challenge. The management was okay, i mean it could definitely use some work, but they are very kind and understanding. I've made many life long friends at Walmart, and it is a positive work environment most of the time, However, the opportunity for advancement was slim to none. No one seemed to care about my interest in a CSM position and my job was quickly getting boring. I didn't know how to apply for the position and I was left in the dark. I felt rather underappreciated, but I still love working at Walmart no matter what."
good,Great place to get job training and help. Lots of neat jobs available. Helpful staff and opportunities.I'm done writing reviews. This shouldn't be required in order to submit any job applications.
good,"Working at Walmart was a nice place to work but it was a little stressful working in he freezer in a very cold place to be geting paid only 9.00 an hour ,but other than than that walmart is a nice place to work friendly customers and assiciates"
good,"Scan customers items out while making conversation."
good,"Overall, the job at Walmart is fine.  I enjoy what I do and do my best to achieve customer satisfaction. However, the way that the management treats their employees is horrible.  The changes that the company has gone through in the past few years has also been terrible."
good,Managment slow when it comes too customer service some managers dont like to help at all there are some assosiates who dont do anything and the ones that do get pulled to work else where
good,"management needs more training and interpersonal skills"
good,I had fun working for them.  I got to know my regular customers and it was great seeing them and I still see some of them when I am shopping there and we talk to one another.
good,Walmart is a good job if you don't have any other career plans in the future that deals with going to school. Sometimes the schedule is flexible and sometimes its fixed depending on management.
good,"Working at walmart was super fast pace and quite confusing at first, but once I learned what I was doing, it was a pretty good job. would work there again."
good,I enjoyed my employment at Walmart. Meet alot of nice people. The management doesnt like cashiers conversations during down time.My chances for advancement never came along after working there for 2 1/2 years.
good,"Management is a bit hard to handle and so are customers, the only enjoyable part of it was when you had those few customers that were actually a nice to you"
good,Pay was great for 3 day of work but management was poor. Beacause of manager 12 hrs became 14 hrs and i was spected to pick up the slack of multiple people. No one was held accountable for anything. At the end i was going to work with zero motivation.
good,Working at Wal-Mart can be a great experience if your store is run correctly. The store i worked for wasn't run as well as it could have been. There would be several managers telling me different things than the other managers and it got confusing. Also we were always short staffed so it was stressful trying to get everything done in a timely matter because overtime was only allowed if approved by management before hand.
good,Very stressful fast-paced work environment. Hard work with barely any compensation. Although most of the people i worked with were friendly and helpful which is one very positive aspect of the Wal-Mart i worked at.
good,"I liked the location where I worked.  There was a comfortable variety of co-workers and customers."
good,This could be a very rewarding career but the policies make it very difficult. I enjoyed a lot about my job especially my customers. I love helping people so this was a very good fit for me.
good,Standard work environment. Very unprofessional work setting. Management was not good and clear on what they expected workers to do. Job was very stressful at times.
good,continually checking peoples good out at a cash register. doing price checks and price overrides if the pricing is wrong. can either be busy or slow either way if you are a cashier you are at the register or zoning your isle or area.
good,The job wasn't the worst thing I have ever done. It was a typical factory job in a way. Everyday was extremely routine. On the plus side you were always busy so time went at a faster pace.
good,"Wal-Mart has been a love-hate work relationship with me. You get to develop your skills at the largest retailer in the world. There are plenty of resources to develop yourself. Fixing a systemic issue can result in millions of dollars for the company so you really see the impact of what you are doing. The culture can be described as follows: Work from 7am to 530pm. Plenty of meetings, most resulting in no results. There is a wide gap in pay from the lower level associates to the higher level. Directors and above make a good amount of money, have good stock incentives, and a nice bonus. Lower level employees can make more money at other companies. Many people leave the company to get a raise, then come back in a couple years at a much higher level, doing the same job they did before they left. There is also a wide gap between the directors and lower level employees with technical skills. If you are a technical person, don't expect your boss to know more than how to use pivot tables in excel."
good,"Well compensated and good benefits. Very strong Culture. Difficult work - life balance. Sometimes unsure of who your supervisor was. "
good,"It a good place if your starting or trying to re-establish work history. I learned multiple work skills that we're beneficial to not only the work place but also everyday life. Management is a roll of the dice, some are helpful and other are not. Just like anywhere else. Hour go up and down and that's the bad thing."
good,"walmart management knows it has a serious issue, i.e. ramp up in T.V. adds. I enjoyed my job, Customer service/ employee moral is at at an all time low. I don't think I'am wrong. I would go back ....but...."
good,Walmart’s a great place to work and offers great benefits. If you love a challenge this is the place for you. Walmart developed opportunity are here and always available through the yesr
good,Walmart is a good place to work. The best part is when helping the customers and each satisfied customer makes you feel accomplished and happy. The instore discount is great too.
good,"Walmart was just a place for me to work and earn money so that I could go to a better job to had a greater future. The employees that I worked with were not the problem it was management. "
good,"no denying Walmart is the largest and most sophisticated retail machine on the planet - with just one store as an example the $ generated and employee base size is what most outside businesses envy - Walmart's are state of art  the education both on the job and internal training is outstanding and highly recommended for any younger highly motivated and energetic person wanting to gain retail and people management skills"
good,"Most of the public wouldn't know, but last year Walmart head office contracted out ALL Maintenance department work to a private contract. Thus ALL maintenance workers with Walmart Canada lost our jobs, benefits etc. Some experienced members in the department were offered jobs with new franchisee, Modern Cleaning Concept of Montreal. I worked for Modern for a few months, but was unhappy with the whole setup, specially the franchisee where my job was ""Transitioned"", and after 3 months I quit. I miss the Inhouse maintenance department coworkers, and the managers at my store.. I know of one or two former Walmart guys who moved to Modern, but have not heard of anyone who is pleased with the new deal [we were promised matching pay and benefits, but management with new company was totally incompetent and difficult to work with.]"
good,"customer service everyday, I learned a lot on front end cashier, office, service desk, sales clerk, was never asked to go to train for Mgt. workplace culture has great values, good work environment, positive workplace, managers friendly. Nothing hard is you are a good worker, customer satisfaction is the most enjoyable part of work because without customers business is nothing."
good,"It's lovely, but the managers have their days, where they want you to do this person job and also yours. But then you have to make sure your area is straight and have to do it fast in order to go to somebody else department and work cause they let them off"
good,"Job is pretty straight forward, but it can be a little fast paced around holidays. Coworkers are fun and supportive. The co-managers are great, but the direct supervisors are a little hit and miss."
good,wall-mart isn't a bad place but it isn't a good place either its fast and their policies are outrageous and sometimes the managers would treat workers unfairly.
good,"Not the worst place to work at, but nowhere near a good one either. Walmart does not provide decent compensation to its workers despite the long hours and stressful work."
good,"Wal-Mart is an alright establishment but in my opinion you're under payed and work entirely to hard for the lil bit of money that you do make. Not to sound like I'm complaining or anything but managers even act funny there, for example showing favoritism to other's."
good,"Really enjoyed working for the cocmpany, just remember that you are here to work. Some people tend to forget that this is the real world and that some of us are here to provide for our familiters mio"
good,It wasn't a bad job. It definitely paid better than most retailers. The downfall is that the managers will put you on an endless loop of temp-hire so that they don't have to give you benefits.
good,Definitely interesting to interact with people daily. Must be patient and have a good demeanor. Lots of work to be done daily and in a fast paced environment.
good,"Most days the good outweighed the bad, but there are a lot of management and communication issues, there is also favoritism and lack of care for employees."
good,I didn’t like management they wouldn’t communicate as needed my jobs as a sales associate was very fun I liked working with people and making new friends
good,when i first started out working at walmart i loved it had the most understanding manger there was but as the years went be we started loosing all the good manger and that's when things started going down hills
good,Very inconsistent work day on a daily basis.  Depending on the previous days activities.  Management team worked together. The hardest part of the job was terminating associates for theft.
good,"The mangement is horrible, their routine is horrible, but they are flexable with scheduling, they are strict on their schedules and you must have a dr.note if you call in, but at least they work you so hard and you get okay pay."
good,"being a cashier for Walmart is stressful, you hear all complaints from customers and they tend to blame you. Cashiers get the brunt of blame for the costumers not being happy yet we have no control on how the store is run."
good,Not the best job but you can deal with it until you have something else to go to. Management likes suckups. That is the only way you get promoted. Hard work doesn't move you up in this place.
good,"Good pay, Most mangers were great, Taxes were terrible. When i first got the job the pay seemed amazing because of how much overtime was needed, worked there for 2 years and it got old quick, they decided to add another shift to the weekend to reduce the amount of OT, so therefor the paychecks started to suck. pretty strict about production, how much freight you load or receive in an hour throughout the day. I hate their discipline system, you get so many Occurrences before you get a Step ""3 steps and you are out"" or you don't make a mistake for 6! Months and they all fall off, Very stressful part about job."
good,the pay is great but the management ehh  not so great so I wouldn't give it to high a rating unless its  based on the pay then 5 stars all the way for a non collage acquired job
good,"The job is good for gaining experience in basic car maintenance. They will pair you up with one of their certified technicians for a few weeks before having you work on anything alone. The management could do better, any disputes brought up would be brushed aside for months before anything was resolved. The tools there were out dated and most were broken. I had to spend a good amount of time figuring out makeshift fixes to keep the shop operating at times. You can get by here but I wouldn't recommend staying too long."
good,"I learned, Fraud Mitigation- investigations,theft management, and  facility security. Process Improvement- operations audit, inventory audits, financial research and compliance., and People Investment- safety, Apa and customer host leadership, operations and event management"
good,Walmart was a fun place to work.  The people were amazing.  Some of the managers were not  associate friendly.  Room for advancement. Front end supervisor played favorites.
good,"Can vary to slow paced to quick, depending on the time, day and if the holidays are around. I learned how to read upc/sku numbers and most of the produce numbers by memory. Management at the beginning of my work term there was okay but it soon turned overboard and it was frustrating. The most hardest thing I had to deal with there was a few customers that yelled at me for making a simple mistake and affected my health greatly. I didn't have too much enjoyable parts of the job but I did had a few good hearted customers that would always like to pay a visit to me."
good,"Job is fairly easy and good pay for the area allows you to be flexible.  Don't agree mostly with the attendance policy, basically if you have some planned, family emergency or get into accident; try not to. They don't care, everything is counted against you."
good,depending on the shift you work you may or may not have a decent manager. I was there for about two years and was promised over and over that i would get a management position but they never followed through. The hardest part about working there was not going off on rude customers. You have to be prepared to not get recognized for all the hard work you do. The most enjoyable part was seeing you're regular customers faces light up when they see that you are working. Or having a customer only go to you because no one else can help them the way you do.
good,this was a learning experience.  ordering paper goods and cleaning supplies and keeping your shelves stocked with product.  keeping your department clean and orderly
good,As long as you show up on time you should do well at Walmart.  Walmart does not have a sick policy.  You are fired at 9 absences in a rolling 6 month period.  It doesn't matter what the reason is and they don't take doctors notes or if you were in the ER.
good,Management has to be more proactive and encourage the associates to be motivated and not afraid to call it like it is. This would benefit both parties
good,"No communication by management. Being short staffed every day. The first Wal Mart I worked at was wonderful, I moved 400 miles and the store that I transferred to is not the environment/atmosphere I want to work in."
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you are in need of a job. They can be flexible with time off. They can be a good crew to work with.If you long enough you can advance.
good,"Being a cashier here is a lot more stressful than one would think. It gets pretty busy and there are never enough lanes open, so the lines back up and it's all on us. The benefits are okay if you take advantage of them, the hours can be flexible which is good if you're a student. You just have to be prepared for people to be rude and get ready for it to be busy."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart but what I didn't enjoy was they were not willing to work with you Also they would give you a raise but then they would cut your hours so that you would lose your health insurance They did this to me on several occasions This is why I had to leave They had cut me down from a 40 hour job that I finally had earned in 2016 to 15 hours a week  "
good,"I thought I was gonna like it, but I didn't. The managers were lazy and were very easy to throw you under the bus to make themselves look good. I don't recommend anyone working here."
good,"walmart can be a fair place to work. you can learn a lot working there, if you can work for walmart you can work for any retail company. you can work at a location that has some of the same old values, the "" family value"" and that comes mostly from the associates and customers, if your able to work in that type of store you have a good one"
good,"Varejo é maravilhoso, experiência rica. oportunidade de aprender bastante."
good,I thought I would retire with Wal-Mart. The company changed so much. They use to work around family. There focus changed from family company to making the bottom line.
good,"ringing up transactions for customers,"
good,"At the time I worked there, they only provided life insurance and this was the main reason I left. It seemed like there was always some kind of drama going on with the other employees, which I didn't care to be hearing about."
good,Aprendizado em conhecimento técnicos e processuais.
good,I gained knowledge of how grocery inventory works. It was a hectic and stressful environment. The hardest part of the job was the lack of teamwork with some of the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I worked with the employees that acted like a team and got things done.
good,I worked in the lawn and garden section. I was responsible to stock shelves and zone the shelves through out the store. During the lawn and garden season I was also responsible for checking people out from our area. The hardest part of the job was dealing with stubborn customers.
good,"From hourly to management, you will work hard and be rewarded for your efforts.  The benefits are competitive.  You need to be self driven and have alot of initiative to get ahead.  No one is going to hand you a promotion, you need to work for it everyday."
good,"What I learned at this job was you have to kind of move at a fast paste. Working Night Shifts at Walmart wasn't easy it was kind of stressful only because some days the Daytime Employee's would leave us to do their work before we can actually do ours. The kind of position I had was Temporary but it was fun except dealing with the kind of managers we had to work with we had more then one manager so it was kind of stressful one manager would tell us to do one thing then the other one would make us stop and do something else. The hardest part of working at Walmart was trying to do a good job, they wanted everything perfect and done right. The most enjoyable part about working there was getting to know everyone and being able to come to work actually excited to work smiling and everything i enjoyed working there I loved when we had BBQ's out of nowhere."
good,"When going  into work nothing is never in order. The managers blame everything on Human Resources. Most of the time when they are handling certain situation they don't know the answer. Also they cut hours like  crazy, even when we are under staff."
good,It's alright because of hours are not to what I expected assume a full time job wasn't working for my schedule but cool at a regular pace job but not the  type for my description .
good,It was ok. The pay could be better.  Management is ok. No real complaints just too bad that working retail is not valued more. It's work that someone hast to do.
good,"Provide exceptional service that ensure customers satisfaction.  Proven ability to increase sales through credit card store applications."
good,"greeted customer installed tires and or oil changes,kept a clean work environment, tried to please customers to the best of my ability,upper management was terrible,don't care about you advancing,don't care about your needs or wants"
good,"Nice company to work for. Diverse in its approach. Direct Line Management positive, effective, supportive and efficient. Strives for a positive workplace culture."
good,The thing is everyone is doing their best to please the customers that come in and you just can't please everyone that comes in. So some days your manager may be upset or your upset because you just dealt with a rude customer and still have a mountain of work to do sometimes.
good,Walmart had education programs as well as a good health insurance program. For some advancement is quick and easy but some have to wait to be considered for higher positions.
good,"A Typical day working by myself"
good,"Walmart is ok for those who can't find anywhere else to work. The Wal-Mart I worked at plated favorites, wasn't helpful when putting you into a new job or area."
good,Management expected to much out of each employ.Wanted you in 3 different places at one time .Was very understaffed and management didn't care how they treated you .
good,"typical day balanced, had an understanding for the company, management was ok. the culture was fun, hard part was trying to get the trucks unloaded on time sometimes."
good,It all depends on what your expecting in a work enviornment. Me personally I didnt enjoy working at Walmart. Honestly it was very simple but on my end the mnagement and atmosphere just werent adequate
good,"Working here taught me alot. It had its ups and downs but there's never enough employees or people to please the demand for help by needy customers. Alot of the times the entire store is un-coordinated and half the employees do not even know what their own stores policies or inventories are like, often resulting in frustration with the customer and rude customer interaction. The managers (outside of a few) constantly beat the idea of ""customer first and is always right"" despite not ad-hearing to this agenda when they themselves must deal with a customer's issue."
good,"Stock personnel would unload the trucks and then stock shelves as quickly as possible.   They expected you to finish everything no matter what, like not having enough workers to properly do the work."
good,Loved it when I first started and grew to hate working at Crosby/Walmart. Management is not appreciative for all you do. And they are very rude and mean.
good,"I can't speak on every Walmart Dc, but this DC is not organize. To much favoritism and result driven. No steady pay raises for every year after 2.5 years is a killer also. Some good coworkers but Management is a mess."
good,"- It is a good place to start especially if you're starting your first job."
good,Good opportunity in rural area where higher paying jobs are limited without substantial travel. Advancement opportunities are available for those who have the ability and desire to do so.
good,"No skills are required to work at Walmart. The people are generally nice, but if you stand out in appearance, you will find some hateful people, even in management. The work is easy & redundant to the point of being mind numbing."
good,"Fun place to work, can not have a career as my background is Information Technology- Telecommunications."
good,"my experience at Walmart changed dramatically throughout the 3 years I was there. the work life balance became terrible because I am not a night person, thus everything in my personal life was sacrificed to achieve the goals of the store. Moving to a different shift or store is harder than promoted. "
good,"Easy but tedious work"
good,I planned on working here to end highschool and then to start college. I was getting 24 hours while in highschool(the maximum i could get) i graduated highschool and was waiting for college to start and i suddenly was only getting 8 hours per week. I talked to personnel about this and they said they'd do something about it so i waited 2 weeks and nothing so i had to leave and find aomewhere else
good,"Eu fazia serviço que não estava na minha carteira,como contar mercadorias da loja , ajustar estoque e financeiro,e muitas vezes fiquei no lugar do líder imediato sem nenhum reconhecimento."
good,I enjoy the people I work with and the environment. The hours were inconvenient for planning around the rest of my life. There are next to no opportunities for advancements.
good,"Working for Walmart can be amazing, or it can be your worst nightmare. It all depends on your management team and coworkers. No two stores are going to be the same, so make sure you look into the specific store you apply to."
good,Always had someone breathing down your neck even if you were doing your job. Had to finish every thing at a certain time then most likely they'd send you off somewhere to help in other departments.
good,"Good place overall,  needs management ,  and flexible hours days worked is ridiculous , instead of shift change like i asked for my days were cut to three days a week"
good,"I was very young when i started working at walmart, 19 to be exact. I worked there for 6 years. I really enjoyed the people for the most part as well as my schedule. I worked in jewelry, as a cashier, as well as a receiving and sales associate. It was okay for the time being but i just didn't feel that it was the job for me and I wanted to advance."
good,"the company in itself is a good place to work."
good,There was a lot of problems with the mangers not being on the same page with how to run the store. Almost everyday not knowing what would the next day be like or what you would be doing wrong do to every manager wanting different things done a different way instead of having it done the way it should  be
good,a typical day at work is pretty stressful. the position is understaffed most of the time. the management is selfish. the hardest part of the job is dealing with the supervisors and their demands. the most enjoyable part is interacting with customers and co workers
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to work for someone entering the job field for the first time. The company doesn't discriminate anyone from working there. This can be good or bad. It seems Wal-Mart can do a better job in hiring more organized and dependable working employees. The benefits are alright and it does offer competitive pay for the type of work available. However, the job culture is unsatisfactory in my opinion. The people are not friendly and it makes it a challenge to come to work everyday with a positive attitude."
good,"Training wasn't very good. The overall structure of things to do is poorly setup. The higher management teams were amazing and great leaders, but lower management didn't care too much about the associates."
good,The sales position I had was in jewelry dept..managers changed often..overall I do believe they are trying to make the job experience better...I helped with Inventory..I helped with Fitting room..I was a cashier and. set up displays..I worked from 5p to 10p..I answered switchboard..I worked in shoe department and accessories department...overall I liked the store and store manager
good,I didn't want to work nights and takea lower paying position. Didn't  feel like thatwas fair. I worked as a office associate for 12years morning shift. Offered cashier position  which would be workingup to midnight some days.
good,Walmart was stressful place to work. Treated unkindly by customers and management. Management had favorites. Customers were rude. Was treated with disrespect on daily basis.
good,"you have to make sure that you stay on you job, do your job, keep up with the time on your own personal time, and keep to yourself unless you are needed."
good,"I've only been with Walmart for 5 months. Day of interview i was offered a cashier positions and that wasn't what I applied for, so i took the position. The ASM that hired me said I can transfer out of cashering after 90 day. I spoke with the Store Manager and the same ASM both made excuses to keep me in the front in. Other than that a few of my coworkers are fun."
good,Terrible  place to work but good for a starter job and some customer service experience. I lasted three years but couldn't handle the rude customers any more so I left.
good,"I really liked working here for the most part, if I hadn't gotten very sick I would still be there. But they do not care why you miss work. Someone who skips work is given the same points as someone who is ill in the hospital."
good,"Depending on what your job title is you can be out on the sales floor folding clothes, cleaning spills, stocking shelves or you can be on register helping customers purchase their goods. I learned how hazmat works and how to claim out merchandise that was broken or tampered with. The management really was horrible. They would schedule very few people to work in certain areas and then call them to go to another area to work and when it came to the end of their shifts they would get in trouble because nothing was done in their departments. Also if you somehow got injured on the job they would write you up saying that you were the one at fault even when it wasn't your fault. Associates were nice but then you have some getting in relationships with others and causing problems, way to much gossip, not the best place to work. Good work experience for people who are just starting out. Hardest part of the job is trying to make sure you and other associates aren't in harms way in some way or another so no one gets in trouble. Most enjoyable part is getting to meet new people who are nice and considerate."
good,I left because management was horrible they tell you one thing and then it never happens. Also you were never backed when having to deal with a difficult customer.
good,"Sometimes this job can be very rewarding but depending on who and how your assistant manager, co-manager, and store manager are you may or may not have it made."
good,"A job is a job. I liked customer service better than cashiering. The more that you can learn and having various jobs to do the better I liked it. "
good,"Buen lugar, con deficiencias administrativas, salariales y de desarrollo de personal"
good,"Handling customer prescriptions, inputting prescriptions, answering multi-lined phone system, filing prescriptions, completing customer transactions.  Fast paced work environment."
good,"Great part time job "
good,Not bad to work for. You work hard and dont get paid enough. You do get a discount and you do get an hour long lunch break. You get shuffled around to different departments alot.
good,Good pay but the constant going back and forth between morning/mid/night shift from day to day was extremely difficult to keep up with and manage a life outside of work. Also the company does not accept doctor excuses no matter what.
good,"Pretty standard retail work. The management was kind of poor at the store I worked at, not to say others are the same. Hours were getting less and less before I left, like a full-time employee was only getting about 32 hours a week which is actually part-time because they didn't want to pay benefits. Store manager was rude to employees when I worked there."
good,"I was a single mom and wanted what was best for my kids. I worked hard every day. I enjoyed everyday knowing that I would be sharing a smile with multiple people trying to brighten their day. "
good,"The company is falling apart internally. They do nothing to motivate employees, the morale is almost gone within the walls, and the managers can't do anything to really assist you. Most people hate it, and only go for what they require. They offer both mandatory and optional overtime."
good,Working as a meat clerk for Walmart Supercenter was overall a good experience for me. They hardly paid me any money but I can't complain because they kept my lights. Met some cool people and learned a lot about meat from a senior worker.
good,I am an employee working days. I like the people but the pay is rather on the low end it would be nice if they paid more and some of the customers look at you like your crazy when you go and say hi to them.
good,"great place for a fist time job."
good,The team members make the work fun! Plenty of opportunity to move up. Not really good with working with your schedules. Stressful very stressful. Good discounts
good,"I worked there for only a few months"
good,"enjoyable part- my teammates "
good,Wal-Mart did not have a lot of hours and also the co worker was not dedicated as a team player. I wanted to advance myself in the workplace but there was not an opportunity available unless you knew the manager.
good,I worked there for several years and wasn't treated the best the whole time. I stuck through it because I wanted to prove everyone wrong and had a family to support. They burn you out and the advances aren't there! I was training a couple people that had been with the company alot less time than me and they had a higher salary! The company made me feel very unappreciated all while I worked my hardest. Got complements from customers and other employees on a weekly basis but was never acknowledged by the staff!!
good,"I really do like my job. I'm just ready for a change. "
good,"Very fast paced always on the go go go!  Was always busy with stocking shelves, cashing out customers, assisting customers with finding items, helping other workers finishing with their tasks after I was finished with my tasks. Always worked rather well with management and gotten along with others."
good,Tasks are given to each employee. Times are attached to the tasks given. Finish before your shift is over. One has to have patients with management and customers. It is very difficult to put my energy into finishing my work and others work every night. Management sees me as someone they can turn to who will get the job done correctly and efficiently. The associates are the best part of the job.
good,"ok place to work.many jobs to do, however not all managers know their job.can be frustrating to work in a chaotic environment where some associates are not in their departments where customer service is needed"
good,A typical day at Walmart is a very busy day. one or two cashiers a lot of customers. You learn how to communicate with different cultures. Management are all on different pages when it comes to Walmart polices. The hardest part of working at Walmart is being very few cashiers.
good,"I liked working at Walmart. Most customers were nice. I had one supervisor that needed to go back to communication school or something because she always talked to me as I were a child and not as her equal. There is a lot of gossip and people like to skip out on work to take unscheduled breaks. "
good,"A typical work day is answering the phone, preparing prescriptions for people, billing and troubleshooting insurance, and preforming actions as a cashier. The hardest part of the job and trying to make sure co workers stay on task and work effectively as a team. Working in the pharmacy with Walmart has no room for advancement."
good,Your just another number in a corporate company where the customers treat you like dirt. There is never enough coverage so its a constant up hill battle to get any job done.
good,fast pace. several task must be preformed on a time limit. cap 1 is a 4 am to 1 pm shift . alot is put on the 1st cap team . 2 others come after  but only cap 1 is responsible for counting of inventory. other shifts do not count the inventory.
good,"Walmart offers many career opportunities; and can be a great place to work.  However, I feel employee loyalty is very low.  "
good,"I over seen cashiers, front end, ran register. I done change overs, gave change to cashiers, put up freight. I helped customers with their problems and help them find items they needed."
good,the job was never bad it was always the people there there attitudes and behavior was uncalled for and the pay wasn't what it could be. the management was very stricked
good,"the management could defintily use improvement, the co-workers could also use some improvement. the environment isn't sressfull itself, it is definitely the management."
good,"It was ok at Walmart as far as binifits just feel I can do better when it comes to employment and my pay rate, nice people nice eviorment and a pretty cool place to work"
good,"There isn't much room for advancement, but it's possible to work your way up. A typical night for overnight stockers is attending the meeting to discuss what needs to be done around the store before proceeding to the backroom to get items needed to carry out your task. It's an easy job. Stock the shelves and put away your cardboard. Management varies depending on a person's personality, but overall they are there to help you as long as you do your job. The coworkers were supportive and friendly. The hardest part of the job was making sure all tasks were done on time. It is fast paced. The most enjoyable parts were the coworkers, interacting with a few customers at night, and knowing what to expect with your tasks once you become accustomed to the job."
good,"The schedules tend to be wrong. they'll have you work 8+ hours if needed and tell you to cut the time before the end of the week even if you short staff. I saw people with job experience in certain departments in other departments that they didn't have any."
good,Rabais employer intéressant nous avions un bonus à chaque année selon le vente et les pertes horaire de travail était bien
good,Was a good place to work if I had to do it again I would the people at the store I was in were very helpful and passionate with me I loved the hours I worked 10:00pm to 7:00am
good,It was good at first until you see what really goes on because I've seen a lot of favortisem around.For the most part you do get a chance to work and get paid for the things you do.
good,It's ok is a living but some times Is hard work.yuo have to go to work with a positive attitude.the pay is decen.pays more than a lot of jobs in texas
good,"I answer phone calls in a professional manner.  I input prescriptions via fax or original copies into the computer. I translate diagnosis codes and figure out days supply by what the doctor has prescribed. I count the pills accurately and efficiently and keep control of inventory as I'm filling. I order the correct amounts needed of the drugs as needed . I check in the drugs in and properly store them. I provide excellent customer service. I also check people out at the cash register and I handle insurance claims. It's a fast paced environment. You must be able to multi task and be able to stand for long periods of time. The down fall is it's usually too busy to take breaks, so at times you become very overwhelmed."
good,A typical day working at Wal-Mart would be fast pace and there is always something to do and learn! I learned how to use the register within a week and being on the floor putting up re-shop was kind of a challenge when i first started but it helped me learn where a lot of merchandise was located around the entire store. Management was the only problem I had because they worked on their own time! I always had to wait for change to give back to the customers making the customers impatient and frustrated.... The hardest part of the job for me was mostly nothing!!! Everything was basic common sense. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying customers and how fast time went by when you were very busy the whole shift.
good,No começo foi bom mas houve insatisfação no decorrer da segunda recontratação
good,"Working for Walmart is fast paced, and they work with you on scheduling AFTER you fight them on it. The supervisors are overworked which then creates hostile environments. The co-workers are nice for the most part. They don't allow holidays off, the only holiday you get off is Christmas day. They don't understand medical problems, so if you have a disability, they most likely won't care. They don't accept dr. notes, so even if you have a reason to miss they still dock it against you."
good,I asked for a schedule change for college they changed for one week and they put me on schedule without me knowing. After that they fired me on the same day I quit
good,"The work demands a lot but pays better than most. While not enough for financial stability, more than minimum. But the job requires a lot of patience and critical thinking."
good,Walmart is fine but it is not a lifetime career.   My co-workers are good but some of the managers have negative attitudes and poor management.  The good managers are very supportive and i enjoy working with them.
good,"The overall store was nice. The associates kept their drama among themselves, most often didn't interfere with working habits/shifts. Different management now, but had a great group of managers when I worked there."
good,"Willing to work with schedules if part time"
good,Working at Walmart was okay. It was just very slow-paced which made me feel like I was working longer than what I actually was. I didn't like standing in one spot all day.
good,"Wal-Mart's wages aren't as competitive as they could be and the work can be fast pace, but generally speaking co-workers are good people. They are very anti union and their training is actually pretty good."
good,"my time at Walmart was pretty decent, i have no complains other than the stress put on employees, especially when supervisors or managers make mistakes or have deadline. employees are pushed rather hard."
good,As long as management let you do your job without constantly breathing down your neck. Then it was okay. Often management would ignore you if needed help.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart because I had a good group of people to work with. The were fun and we all worked hard as a team. I did find that the promises of helping to advance in the company short lived. They weren't eager to give advancement to those good at working in produce, I believe, because it's hard to find good workers willing to work in that department."
good,Working as a cashier means moving to different cash registers all day long. Giving the costumer the best costumer satisfaction is always the first thing to do.
good,"I definitely enjoyed working at Walmart although I felt as if there was a sense of ""I'm better than you because I get paid more"" kind of atmosphere. Mostly, it'd be managers talking down to a new associate who hadn't learned the ropes yet."
good,"A typical evening at work would be to clean the entire store, work on average 4000 pieces of freight, clear the parking lot of all carts, make sure pallets where organized out back, reset all cash registers and atm, wax, scrubbed, and buff entire sales floor and backroom. Backrooms had to be cleaned and organized. This all had to be done with an understaffed 10 to 12 associates. Normally the sales floor and backroom would be totally destroyed. Every night was a challenge."
good,fast paced working environment that can be stressful at times. Typical retail environment that can allow for work place advancement. Management is often not supportive.
good,". Mayormente los de día se dedican a atender clientes y quitar cartones en  el área."
good,"Walmart is actually an ok place to work for. Great benefits. But high turnover. Not much room for advancement and bad management. They bend rules for some associates but are ""by the book"" with others. No one really knows what ""policy"" is but yet it gets thrown around to justify certain actions. Just sloppy. Not a tight ship."
good,"Walmart was an okay place to work at, it was sorta slow paced. They kinda ask you to do things that you shouldn't do, like they would make you unload trucks even though that wasn't your position. But overall, it would recommend the job if you really really needed to work."
good,Not a bad place to work at if in the middle of a life transition. I was a  young student at the time and I was able to balance my lifestyle with this balanced job.
good,"The people are great the mngmt suxed.  The people we're good people for the most part but the upper mgmt would throw you under the bus. I really liked my job, made a few friends. But upper mgmt still sux."
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-workers, having a good time and made lots of laughs. Great place to work with poor management, Worked in clothing which wasn't bad had great customers and did well as a associate."
good,Grande empresa mas pouca oportunidade de crescimento e desenvolvimento do potencial. Falta valorização dos funcionários.
good,"If your one of the favorites good for you your going somewhere. For the actual hard working people they don't even get a thanks. Management is just messed up one manager says on thing and another manager says another, the favorites get all the perks days requested off, weekends off, morning shifts, and tasks they want. Favoritism at this store is a huge problem. Also discount employees get sucks it doesn't apply for everyday necessities like food which is the thing that most employees buy."
good,"Always work limited budgets cookie cutter retail room for advancement fast learning environment. Follow the rules, however, no friends only competitors."
good,Did not like working there managers was rough on employees did not want to give raises did not want to be fair to other people would love to see Walmart change
good,It was difficult when having a new baby to pump at work on breaks. There were accommodations that were made for that to happen. I didn't feel as if my well being was cared for there. I was just another person. I enjoyed how fast pace being in the pharmacy was but not the inflexibility of being in there.
good,Walmart is sometimes stressful. There's a lot going on at one time. Sometimes it's in organized. Walmart pays good but isn't very flexible with scheduling.
good,I had intended on retiring from Walmart but the manager says don't expect to earn a living  there. Ok I have been there almost 13 years now you tell me this! People who have been accustomed to living a certain way and you constantly cut hours and bonuses are getting lower and lower each time but you get the big bucks and bonuses while cursing out your assistants! I just don't understand where respect for the individual is in all of this. I just go in and do my job and try not to come in contact with any management.I have ten more years until retirement and I pray that I make it but I am looking for a part time job. You gotta have a plan B! Walmart is a good place to work if you plan on moving up and I guess it could depend on what store you are in as to how managers treat the employees.
good,Decent place to work..nice atmosphere very fast paced nice vacations as well as good health and dental insurance overall a decent job to have in this area
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart to me was fun, exciting and enjoyable I loved my customers. I learned had to be a good customer service worker, be patient, professional, smile and learn as much as I could about the products in the Electronics Department. Management changed all the time and some were nice and some were not so nice and understanding to the employees needs. Workplace culture is what we the employees made it the Electronic Department was very diverse and we made the best of it in spite of our race, color and/or religious beliefs. The hardest part of my job was not knowing why an item was no longer available in the store, why the customer was so upset when an item wasn't available for them to purchase but was available on line, explaining to a customer what happened and calming them down. Speaking with a customer who didn't speak English I learned a little Spanish and was able to resolve the issues for most of my customers. The most enjoyable part of my job at Wal-Mart was seeing a customer happy about a product they had just purchased and was satisfied with my assistant"
good,"Overall my experience at Walmart was average. Because I was part-time, I received no benefits, but I do know my full-time co-workers did. There is at least tuition help, vision, medical,  and paid vacation time as far as I know. It does take a while to earn vacation time, though. "
good,Working with scanners and Label maker. Cleaning aisles. Replacing merchandise when aisle is out. Stocking shelves when new merchandise comes in . Cleaning and maintaing back stock. Assisting Customers when needed.
good,We had to load 5 trailers  a night by yourself  from front to back by hand no forklift  no help everyone  of then with no help u have to to keep the line from backing up with freight
good,Over worked and way under paid no room for advancement unless some one quits there noon very poor pay would never work for Walmart again...............
good,"Upper management was good, supervisors weren't so much. Associates were rude, they had their own cliques and weren't open to new people. Hours were all over the place unless you worked graveyard."
good,This is a good job as well. it keeps you busy nonstop. Walmart is a very good job that helps you with your career. They have a very nice management as well. Everything went well everyday you have a set schedule. the co workers are just amazing you make a family there. they are flexible with your schedule that's of course with telling them at a reasonable time
good,"You would clock in wait for the meeting, you would then work in your isle until break.Some of the mangers were good others were very poor managers. The only real issue I had with the job was working third shift, it was not good for me, Other than that I didn't mind working there."
good,bom ambiente  eselentes pessoas grau de exigência alto
good,Management throw you into the dogs to figure things out on your own with no help and just barking. You get in more trouble than you are noticed even learning
good,"It's a nice first job to start at, they work with you any way they can. I loved working there for 2 years but the day management had a problem with overnight management which made things hard because we wouldn't know whose plans to follow which would get us in trouble with higher up management. The best part of working for Walmart are the coworkers. The worst part is management they seem like they don't really care for the job they have. overall it's a great job if you can put up with management."
good,"Erratic scheduling from closing one night and being scheduled to open the next morning on a continual basis, which varied each week made it difficult to maintain any routine, because there was no routine."
good,they pay you fair and health insurance and vacation pay but some of the managers aren't really truthful or reliable in Leesville LA walmart and they have favorites and they fire you if you dont complete everything when they give you 10 things on your list when there are other people to list them on those tasks
good,"Good day at work, there's no hard of the job, great environment, enjoyable work place. Always learn something new. Great workers. Flexible working hours."
good,"management very unprofessional, lots of gossip, sabotage, but was a lot of hours work and at least Wal Mart position had our own equipment, so didn't have to carry demo cart and equipment in and out of store"
good,I did not like how the management handled certain situations. I feel like the employees worked harder than what they were been paid for and that they were extremely strict.
good,"Management will pick favorites over those who may do their jobs well. Flexible hours with good reason however, most members of management tend to think that having a family is not a good reason to have restricted hours."
good,I enjoy the shift and most people I work with but the work is very difficult and they expect a lot out of their associates.  They are taking away positive benefits for associates and not replacing them with any positivity to be employed there other than the benefits you pay for.
good,it was very stressful sometimes and also the manager would get angry if you were sick or even had to call out for personal reasons and he will take it out of you.
good,Try to run a big store like this on as few associates as possible. Getting yelled at for not getting things done elsewhere when getting pulled to other departments. Getting pulled to other places even when there is no staff in your department. The list goes on and on.
good,Working the freight staying Productive. Downstacking the freight making sure your work is done.there are days that are slow and other days that we are very busy
good,"The job itself was easy. I would stand and watch the door on self checkout and zone candy. then after lunch myself and the other cashier would switch spots and id take the only register open with the cigarettes. Normally we weren't busy. so to be busy we would have to zone candy and make sure everything looked nice for the big boss.The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management. Very poor management, all the ones in there had a favorite didn't really care about the ones who had been there for anthing less than a year. would always complain to me about their mishaps and it was just a bad experience. The most enjoyable part was being able to talk to my normal coworkers they were fun to talk to, just not management."
good,ive worked at may Walmart stores  and this one was the best. the helped me and encouraged me to be a better leader and they didst discriminate  against my personal back ground. the staff were kind and funny
good,"Typical day at work, requires doing freight, checking in jewelry, paper work and inventory, and dealing with customers. I've learned problem solving, and multitasking. When it came to management, that was kind of in the air... some managers, were very helpful and understanding, when others were just there for a paycheck, and seemed unhappy with their jobs, and showed little to no care for some associates. Hardest part about the job was dealing with some difficult customers, overloading tasks, when they expected one associate to do too many things all at once with lack of help from others at times.However, on the other hand... I enjoyed meeting and helping different people despite some of the hard work and struggles, I also found some of the customers intriguing sometimes."
good,"Management needs to improve, not everyone there care about the employees unless they are liked. There is sure favoritism. but there is opportunity for growth..mostly everyone is very nice and easy to get along with."
good,I have enjoyed working as a cashier for 2 months before being promoted to customer service manager.  I have learned a lot of skills in this position that it will be an asset anywhere I go in the future.
good,Some walmarts are better than others. The first one I worked at was great. The one I transferred to wasn't so great. It's a mix bag and you never know what you're going to get until you get it.
good,"Workers falling under the job title of sales associate take responsibility for greeting customers, locating products, price-checking items, and organizing store shelves and displays. Sales associates also answer customer questions about policies, services, and products."""
good,"Overall working environment is pleasant and training is encouraged. Management sometimes seems more focused on profit than anything else. Employees are sometimes treated the same as any other asset, including merchandise. Some individual managers are very good at times, but seem to be easily influenced by other managers. Most managers seem to be over tasked and often forget to follow up on questions and concerns from employees Full time employees are often not given 40 hours per week. Most employees are friendly and easy to work with."
good,"I did not work here long due to move to Des Moines. "
good,"During my time as a Pharmacist in Wal-Mart I generally would work at different stores (about 15 stores) and normally was the sole Pharmacist on duty with a decent size pharmacy staff to direct throughout the day. This job required multitasking, teamwork, and an abundance of interpersonal skills, self control and stress tolerance."
good,I didn't enjoy my time at Walmart. Lots of standing and doing nothing. Communication was poor. Mountains are made of molehills if anything goes wrong.
good,"I am amazed that anything ever gets accomplished there, get conflicting sets of instructions daily. No real effort to grow someone into their responsibilities just throw you in and hope you learn to swim."
good,Agradável para trabalhar. Gerência eficiente e segue as regras da empresa.
good,This was just a work while I was in college job. It was a cashier position but showing initiative gave me the opportunity to move up quickly and learn different departments.
good,Hard work love all the people that are  in the store  and love working in a store you your good day and your bad ones that are in doing your job and being  good at it to
good,This is a decent workplace. Loved the people i worked with. Could pay their employees better. And make sure they give you your breaks on time. Overall ok.
good,"Very poor management if you got sick you couldn't even talk to a manager, which in my belief communication is one of the biggest skills that needs to happen. Other than that, the co-workers  were extremely friendly and easy to work with. I loved working with the customers and being able to put a smile on their faces."
good,"Worked here for quite awhile, I definitely loved the place and people but management over time started changing rapidly.  New store manager would fire associates and hire more than he fired.  It was a great job then turned miserable in end."
good,Empresa era agradável mais porém benefícios insatisfatório para maioria !
good,People tend to be hostile here at the beginning of every shift but to give them the benefit of the doubt as the work day tends to improve later after stressful parts are done.
good,If the employees would be on the same track then it would be a great work place. Managers tell people different things so work is always being redone or changed.
good,Just like my summary says its a huge company and policies can get misinterpreted management can abuse power and the new hires all get the short end of any stick.  Its what i expect from a company of this magnitude.
good,"Great atmosphere to work in but the management picked favorites and need less to say if you were not one of them you were giving then worst treatment. They would say they were going to help you move up in the company you do everything they ask and everything you needed to, then they would throw you out like you weren't good enough and move on to someone else. Even if you were the only one in your area that did your job."
good,"I liked working at Wal-mart for the most part. It wasn't too bad. I was offered a full time position after less than a month. HOWEVER, I was I wasn't given a raise when I signed my full time employee paper. I was given a raise about 3 months later, but it was a nationwide raise for all basic Walmart  employees. "
good,It was okay far as getting to know people and working long hours the hardest part was working in the rain an snow other then that it was an okay job ..
good,"Walmart is one busy company. You would spend hours in a day trying to place items, fix things and always making sure your store is clean and shopable for customers. I hardest part about the job is keeping the staff and employees all on the right track when the holiday season starts to get here. I love working for Walmart helping others, making sure its clean. My favorite time of years at Walmart of the seasons from fall into the winter time its keeps me busy and looking foward to working each day."
good,"The management at this job was extremely difficult to work with and was not very considerate of my schedule. The customers were always nice, as well as some of my associates. However, the hardest part about this job was maintaining a good relationship with the management staff."
good,"If your desperate go for it. Its mostly management that doesn't know what the heck they are doing, I personally had a department by myself and my assistant manager had no idea how to run it."
good,"Walmart is not too bad for a starting job for people as opposed to something like fast food.  The hours can be a little all over the map, but the job is not super hard for the most part and the people are actually usually quite enjoyable to be around."
good,"Working at Wal/mart is productive , it is like being in a big family . The work is easy some days are challenging and some days are slow. You get an hour lunch."
good,"The main thing I would like to say concerns the manner in which the place was managed. There were so many times when policies changed at the drop of a hat. Also, many policies were not enforced for a long time until employees had gotten accustomed to getting away with certain things. Then management would start to enforce certain policies tighter but only for a very limited time."
good,It was horrible overall they would make you do more then what they would be paying you and if you didn't show enough work ethnic they would pressure you to do more then what you were already doing .
good,Walmart is an great company but they people you have to deal with as far as management team and associates working for retail things has to be complete and done managed also organized you have to be dedicated determined also love what you do retail is an challenge
good,"More managers than people to do the job correctly."
good,"When I worked for this company it got to a low point where I was working the job of three people. I was a cake decorator and they had demands that they wanted me to do, but I also had customer orders that were due. So I told them they needed to bring someone in to help with a few things and it turned into they had someone come in to do my job while I did the bakery associate job. I was not ok with that."
good,Although working for Walmart was well. The Managers are very helpful. The Co-Workers never came together as one to help out each other. I would like to be in an environment where i can count on my fellow co-worker to help me if needed.
good,"Stocking is a daily and repeated routine."
good,"While I loved the managers and early experiences I had with the company upon first reporting as their employee, over the years it became less and less fun.  After they decided to restructure some areas of the company, my job was eliminated.  I didn't stay too long after that.  If I was in need of a job, I would apply but I would have to be very desperate."
good,Cashier everyday is challenge daily with customers and management     Managers are hard to work with a times  managers always have their favorites which isn't the best for any job in my view
good,"Pay isn't too bad especially since  I only have a HS diploma.  Didn't like that it was a fight to try to get you any hours"
good,"- Opportunities to learn across organization"
good,Either than my awesome boss I did not enjoy my work. I would come in and have to ask for receipts and to look into people's bags. I would also be ask to tell people to leave the property but my words really didn't have power due to the fact Wal-mart had us back off and call higher management if anything looks iffy. I believed I could have done what they did more efficiently and better.
good,Its an interesting place to work. you are exposed to a wide variety of people and are told the most interesting things. it is a fast paced environment and is easy to get used to. Good Luck
good,Il demande beaucoup trop pour pas un gros salaire par compte très bon pour étudiant et personne sans enfant pour les parent mono parentale pratiquement impossible pour le genre d'horaire
good,Positive environment but don't get paid enough wages. It's nice and cool in there. We get good breaks. They don't have a set schedule. In my opinion the job sucks and I would not recommend working there unless u enjoy getting a low pay. You do not get paid enough to have to deal with lifting heavy objects for hours at end.
good,"Like any other retail environment, Wal*Mart has a high turnover rate. There are also too many managers and not enough employees on the floor. If you work there for too long you may be forced out by management. If you need a job it is an okay place to work."
good,"Not a bad place to work, advancement is possible but being understaffed constantly puts a strain on your work. You will most likely feel overworked if you are above a normal associate position."
good,It was a nice place to work.  You always had something to do and actually felt like you were accomplishing something everyday you went to work.  I enjoyed to people and the work.
good,"As a past Walmart employee, I enjoyed working with the general publc, helping and assisting customers. Managers need more training on firing employees"
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart when the management actually treated me right.  I was once told to choose between Walmart and school, because my manager wanted me to work more often."
good,"We had same store manager for 16 years, he was forced out, and every manager there has left or is leaving. Don't fix what's not broke. I had one customer whom told me she had called home office to praise me, never heard a word from upper management."
good,"Me hicieron un curso de cajera de supermercado, pero aparte de eso trabaje como polifuncional, es decir, trabaje también como reponedora, aprendi bastante en estos dos cargos, y tuve buena relación con mis compañeros."
good,"Good hourly wage and benefits and a very good work/life balance are positives.  Not a bad job if you expect to be on the bottom rung in your career.  If you are looking for advancement, I wouldn't hold my breath."
good,"Although it can get rough at times, the salary is worth it. Managers were almost to strict. To explain, they were very picky and unclear at times with scheduling, allowing work-life balance, how we did our work, rules of the company seem hard to grasp. I did like that I could go at my own pace and had some independence yet we were still working as a team. Most enjoyable part of my job was obviously payday. So the job is very hard work but I think there is a balance with the great salary."
good,The organization is too large and surprisingly disorganized.  Continuous change is the only constant and the pace in which change is implemented is so fast it makes your head spin. Management is often times on a power trip.
good,"most of the time it was non stop"
good,"when I srarted here, I loved the place, it really lived by the family experience and appreciation for job well done, but over years changed and management and upper management as well, now it is all about the money and could care less about the employees and no respect anymore or appreciation. I would not recommend this place to anyone, and will not even shop there anymore, I have grown to dislike this place very much."
good,Job goes well with my daily schedule. I learned to skillfully operate a fork lift. Management is below average. Management only cares about other members of management and do not care any for employees or their families. The most enjoyable part of the job is driving my fork lift
good,I would never work there again. They gave me all 8 hour days but one so they didn't have to give me benefits. they fired me because i had the flu due to me watering plants at 5am in winter and was not allowed to wear a sweatshirt.
good,Overall Walmart is a good place to work. I learned a lot about customer service in the years that I worked for them.Morale of the employees could be better.
good,"Over all when I worked in the back room my team was nice and understanding, the work was tedious but not hard, and the conditions were fine. However Management was everywhere, they were the reason I left..."
good,"I am a little anti Walmart because it's size, aggressiveness against competition and reputation for poor pay with employees but I actually really enjoyed my job. Good guys, good work, good hours, good experience."
good,"To many chiefs and not enough Indians mentality."
good,"I worked for this company for five years. It had many ups and downs. Cons:"
good,They dont care about there workers. My girl friend was pregnant and they yold e if I valuedy job I would come to work instead of being there fot y kid to be born..
good,walmart company would not be a bad place to work if the employees were compensated for the amount of work involved. not a job i would want to do again unless was part time only.
good,"Co-workers were too childish to work with.Management had favortism,and if you were not considered to be in there click they gave you a hard time.Management would place you where you couldn't make production.They write you up even if your getting trained.training was not training you suppose to have up to three weeks, they give you like a week and throw you to the wolves."
good,Too much favoritism in the cuero pharmacy dept workplace too many young pharmacists makin racial remarks making fun of customers not very professional at all!
good,The best part of the job is working with the customers.  Management can do better and give us the right tools to do our job. Overworked n understaffed
good,"Es una empresa con beneficios en los horario para estudiar, tiene viáticos de alimentación,  un incentivo anual como bonificación por resultados, y una asociación solidarista."
good,"Walmart is a very busy job, you have to stay on your toes. Making sure shelves are stocked, and you have the supplies needed to perform your job duties during the day."
good,They did not know how to work with the employees when they had something important like an appointment they would not work with u with the schedule. They have their favorites and they do more for them then anyone else.
good,"Adquiri um grande conhecimento de varejo, marcas e produtos na empresa. Tive colegas de trabalho excelentes, mas a direção e gerencia não eram tão eficientes. Pouca autonomia e dificuldade de expressão."
good,Bounced around from schedule to schedule.  Doing different things was fine until I was placed under a new supervisor who made a job change for me without my authorization.
good,it was not a bad job. i enjoyed working their meet a lot of good people while i was their. thinking bout going back. management was not bad at all. my day was just normal nothing out the ordinary
good,Customers would be the hardest people to deal with. Managers were sometimes hard to get a hold of when an issue with a customer arose. Scheduling conflicts were something that happened frequently
good,"It sucks. It's pretty bad. Managers suck. They win't fire people who need to be fired. People get away with not doing their jobs, and I have to pick up the slack. I break my back every day there, and we still fall behind because of my co-workers."
good,"It's a really hectic workplace where you can expand your customer service skills. What I like the most was sharing conversations and helping the customer. There is no specific shift, every week will change."
good,I think this job taught me more about retail more than any other job and also you can also move up in this company very quickly if you want to advance in a short time.
good,Management are rude and disrespectful. Besides that it is an good place to work. Pay is good for a beginning family or college student just starting out in life.
good,"Had I worked days, it may have been okay. But, working nights has given my extreme insomnia. People that start working there get same pay as people that have been there for 10 years. Not fair if you are a hard worker."
good,"I loved the people I worked with and the job helped me get over most of my social anxiety. However, the job was terribly boring and the day seemed to drag regardless of how busy it was."
good,"La empresa es bastante buena pero falta una mejor administración y ser un poco mas accesible con el lema de ""el cliente siempre tiene la razón"" , Esto debido a que a veces menosprecian a los trabajadores por darle la razon al cliente cuando realmente no debería de ser así"
good,Gives great job advancement opportunities. Can work with associate's schedules. Company's new policies do not tolerate absences and will be held accountable and fired if you miss work  more than 9 times within a year period.
good,Would assist clients in there finally purchase by casing them out and properly bagging their items. also making sure they had an excellence experience by shopping at our store.
good,"This place can treat their associates a little better, If you aren't one of the managers favorites then you will be treated differently. Some managers there are payed back and will work with you and they need more people like that. The store manager there now seems pretty layed back.  If they don't like you they try to find any reason to get rid of you, plus they watch you like a hawk! If they treat their cashiers tile they treat some of theirs customers it will be a lot better place to work."
good,"Management was decent, work load was fairly steady, a very physically demanding workplace, very clean environment, and an EXTREMELY thorough training program."
good,unorganized. had some good things but more bad than good. i would suggest a friend to work there only if they really needed the money. in the department i was in it was too stressful.
good,"It was a monotonous job.  You do the same thing every day, day after day, week after week, month after month.  Management can care less about you as an individual, only that you get the job done.  Some are friendly, most are not."
good,With the scheduling have very little time for family and personal life. Discount card is nice but only 10%.  Management teams have lack of communication and not team up to accomplish.  When in management don't receive full meals or break periods to offset the time worked at 10 hour shifts. Always called in from rest periods for small things that another manager could take care of.  Overall good associates throughout the company.   There is discounts through other companies working for Walmart that include car rentals family fun parks and cruises.  There is 401k and benefits but are pricey if needing entire family.
good,"I was employed for walmart for four years, i at times felt unappreciated. Management is not what it used to be. It's a great experience overall. In my personal experience i was harassed and mistreated but its not the same for everyone."
good,"Been there 13 years with no advancement. Applied for other areas, got interviewed for it, always given to someone else. Would get my yearly evaluation with great marks, no pay raise tho. Work hard, get along with everyone, but no appreciation"
good,"It was very stressful, little to no help . But i loved the customers. Great place to meet people and i love the store it self. I would work here again most definitely."
good,"I enjoyed working as a cashier at Walmart because it gave me plenty of opportunity to interact with customers. A typical day would consist of nonstop interaction with people which made for good conversation along with learning opportunities. I learned how to effectively manage a Point of Sale System. Had I not joined the military, I probably would have stayed and progressed at Walmart."
good,"Was a great job while attending college, very flexible, I was put in the electronics department with a fairly good pay. However, management issues and other conflicts make this job dim and can put departments on edge. Communication between management needs to improve as well as with their associates. Loved this job for the 2 years I have worked here, however, it has recently gone down hill, at least for my store. Lots of good people left, and lazy people got hired. Too many changes/expectations and lazy upper management who seem bugged to help their fellow associates with simple things like unlocking an area or part of the backroom. This may not be true for all Walmart's but I'm sure this isn't the first Walmart that has had management issues."
good,"Worked long term and was well compensated.  Coworker's were really great people, however leadership spoke a lot to ""Family"" but made decisions daily that demonstrated you were really just an employee.  Take the talk with a grain of salt, leadership feels no guilt in laying off talented experienced associates to achieve their goals and bonuses."
good,walmart was a good job enjoyed working at walmart did management positions as well loved meeting new problem loved solving problems and helping customers
good,Very Fast paced environment.  Requires attention to providing stock items to please customers.  Overall the company tries every effort to meet the customer satisfaction.
good,"Always behind, can never catch up"
good,"Not my best experience. It couldve been how shorthanded we were, but management would have unrealistic expectations of us some nights, and the harder the work got the more they expected us to take on the burden left behind by other employees who left which was frequent."
good,"The hardest part of the job wasn't dealing with irritated customers or frustrated co workers, but in the that was spent away from my family. As a newly married woman I was trying to balance work life and home life and it became difficult because of the hours worked and at the time there was no way for me to get insured."
good,It's a company striving valiantly to win in eCommerce but it leaves some people drowning in the intensity of the battle.  Managers need to be more empathetic and senior leadership needs to be more transparent.  Not for the faint-hearted.
good,"Well since I enjoy working under pressure because I like a challenge, I didnt mind a very busy, face paced job. For me it was a good job for you to get on your feet."
good,"Be ready for long hours and hard work.  As a manager, your day starts about an hour before your associates and ends at least an hour or two after theirs.  At the DC I was at, management training is pretty much on the job, learn as you go, sink or swim.  I have had the opportunity to work with some great people and others, well, you know!"
good,"Stocking, customer service, merchandiser, I learned retail inside and out. Management has little to desire. The hardest part of the job is things change from day to day."
good,when I worked there yrs. ago it was fun and like a family. We all got along and new our work duties. I was fun helping the customers print their photos. I was fun helping them find the right camera for their needs to take certain pictures.
good,Customer service comes first. That's the motto and is very obvious when they put that in front of employee's well being. Management talks down to those under them like everyone else but them are stupid while everyone else is seeing them as coming up with terrible ideas that are counter intuitive or clearly shouldn't work.
good,"Management treated employee as numbers, no loyalty.  Friends would take care of friends in management.  People were unable and going threw the motions."
good,Management at Grovetown Walmart cares about nothing but themselves and what effects them. If you work hard you will get hours. Promotions are given to whoever can kiss the most butt and has little to nothing to do with years working for Walmart or education level. The pay is better than minimum wage which is the largest and maybe the only plus of working for Walmart.
good,They do not care about their employees they see them as replaceable they do not care about your health they wanted me to come in an hour after i had my tooth taken out after being under anesthesia and on heavy pain medication and do not work with your hours that you can work and can't
good,Its an ok place to work its better than working in a fast food resturant. And there are some good days at work then there are some very hard days at work. As long as you are ready to work you can get the job done.
good,"Work was great but management could have been better organized, friendly co-workers who train you correctly and efficiently. Work hours are fair and decent"
good,"Stocking shelves is not a difficult job, but Wal Mart makes it harder than it needs to be. Management is not supportive of employee's. The hardest part was stocking according to a timeline. Skids were not organized according to aisle."
good,"Great place to work at and gives you a lot of experience with the customers. They are very flexable with the schedules, which is very good. The salary is decent."
good,"the job stressed me out too much to be able to hold on to it unfortunately. Very fast paced and busy. Lots of people, too much pressure. Understanding staff"
good,"es una empresa con una gran visión,solo que la falta de personal a veces te limita a realizar todas las actividades y llegar a los objetivos en el tiempo establecido."
good,"Wal-mart is strict on the amount of days you miss, there wasn't a whole lot of teamwork and several times I could not go home sick or I would be fired"
good,Worked during the busiest time of the year.I was only there a short time . people were friendly and warm enough. I was always busy working the front line
good,Managers here have unrealistic expectations they expect a new employee to have the same knowledge and experience as employees that's been there for years.
good,"Worked with great people. Pay wasn't so great. Hours of work were all over the place, not a steady schedule. Also, I didn't receive any benefits. Very limited full time positions."
good,"The work environment is very competitive.Most associate do not last very long. It is very hard to move around in the company, but there is enormous chances for advancement."
good,"Not everyone at Walmart is awful, but for most of the part from what I've experienced is most are poorly trained/ready, there are cvery rude people who let power go to their head, ad nobody want to take the time to help each other."
good,"theres no set structure, the managers are lazy and uptight, and the hours are rediculous. but with cons come pros.. like the employees are super sweet and down to earth and its a safe environment to work in"
good,"Starting Hourly pay rate just around national average."
good,The manager of the store is rude and then new assistant manager he brought it for overnights was condescending and tried to humiliate associates to get more work out of them. The other managers were nice and friendly.
good,Management was bad and most of them made ppl quit by cutting hour. didn't learn very much but what walmart management was like and it was sad for them to cut hours to 2 four hour shifts for 1 week.
good,Walmart distribution pays well and has great benefit options. You work long shifts in a building that does not have climate control. This job is a physically laborious job.
good,"The job paid the bills. Unless you are a cashier or management, you will be moved around from one section to the next in the first few months. This will cause a headache inevitably."
good,Walmart was an amazing company to work for at first. But then as you start to work there longer you realize how many skeletons are hiding in their closets. The most enjoyable part of working there is most of your fellow associates are pretty cool. Management sucks and they never seem to have any clear communication between each other.
good,"Worked 10 hour days five days a week, half an hour for lunch, very stressfull job, called doctors to confirm customer can get a refill on their prescriptions, inventory had to be exact every day, I would do atleast 300 prescriptions a day. Swamped with ringing telephones and customers all day, I had to do the cash register sometimes also, and drop off all the money the Pharmacy made that day to the cash office."
good,"Compensation stinks. I have years of cashiering experience, but I was started at the same rate as others. Managers preach opportunity for advancement, but unless you are super friendly with management, you will not be advanced. Lunch breaks are usually 30 to 60 minutes late. They are really good at being flexible with your  schedule."
good,"I would come into work greet our customers, pull freight to the floor and stock the shelves. The hardest part of the job was the competitiveness, getting compared to other workers was a terrible thing. But the most enjoyable part was being around customers and helping them find everything they needed."
good,i always booked my time off and was never given to me. workers were bossy but work wasn't to bad. no one wanted to stick around because no one liked each other not a friendly environment
good,Being with a company for ten years is a great accomplishment. Although there isn't many positions for advancement it is a rewarding job working with the public and the benefits we provide for the community.
good,"Wal-Mart isn't the best place to work. I don't want to work for another Wal-Mart in my life. they don't treat their employees right, and the pay sucks."
good,Over rated under paid for over night went out of my way to learn and get certified on all equipment and all courses available to go from remodel to over night stocker for no raise. Management failed to see workers slack off over night and im a hard honest worker so i just tryed to pick up the slack only to have some overnight management play favouritism.
good,I was just a seasonal worker but they treated us like we were nothing.  They promised that most of us would get hired on to the store full time when the seasonal work was done but this was not the case. Luckily I was just doing it as a job while I was taking summer classes.
good,"Walmart es una empresa, en la cual comence mi carrera laboral, y me enseño la tolerancia a la frustracion, asi que decidi emprender mi vuelo hacia algo mejor."
good,Some days it's fine some days it's stressful especially especially when you have a nasty managers but other than that is finesometimes they play ball with all the Walmarts we walk for breast cancer and I like to do that
good,Overall a great place to work. Walmart Distribution Centers offer opportunities to earn bonuses each week. They have excellent work schedules to fit every associates needs.
good,Working for Walmart on and off for 23 years. Walmart changed and it became more about money than taking care of the associates. At times management did not care and that made for uncomfortable situations.
good,while i worked for Walmart the hours was good and i learned how to communicate with the customers and do my job tasks at hand. it gave me responsibility.
good,Walmart has an excellent Management Training program.  The individuals are cross trained in every aspect of the store.  The program consisted of 12 weeks in which you needed to oversee each department and then are tested on the knowledge you gained.
good,they do nothing for the employees I was there for a year and ahalf have big turn over I was a cashier who liked the job have nothing else to say about Walmart
good,"I'm in the retail pharmacy and the bottom line is the dollar figures, not the personable touch given to the patients.  Sad to say that they care more about figures on paper that the customers that are making that figure for them.  Doing more work getting less pay, not fair by any means."
good,Loved working at company until it was no longer about taking care of the employees or families. It became more about making money. No longer had a personal life due to working extremely long hours.
good,since I have worked at Walmart I always have something to do I learn many things since I been there the managers are not to bad once you do your job the hardest part of work at
good,"High Stress environment, lots of opportunity for advancement. not much work/life balance. Issues with upper management and constant change of expectations"
good,"for the most part I enjoy working here, most of the staff is nice but theres a training program you have to complete and its hard to when you're called up front every time you sit down to work on it. I make great pay and bi-weekly paychecks are wonderful! One of the negatives is they forget your breaks on occasion and can also be kinda rude to cashiers."
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho: Ótimo"
good,The people and co-workers that you interact with are fun and enjoyable. Scheduling and customer service are poor. Walmart also relies on a small point system that is difficult to maintain.
good,the management team made me feel unwelcomed and made me uncomfortable ninety percent of the time. when I first started I felt harassed by some of the management team here.
good,I liked working here. Fun fast paced I think they should really find new management. Also believe they need better customer service reps I loved the fact that you had a quota to meet while ringing people out so it was a challenge.
good,the management  was unprofessional. The pay was too low. I learned how to use the hand held computers. The hardest part was working in the freezer and on the trunk. The easiest part is stocking merchandise.
good,under rated poor communication skills fast pasted no acknowledgement for going above and beyond your job title love associates i work with and directed how to go about daily assignments
good,"You have the opportunity to have different shifts, and bonus on your performance. However, if you are very efficient, you may get a bonus, but then you are sent home, so the bonus just barely covers the wages you are losing for leaving early. One shift is said they do 33 hours at least, but there are many weeks that you might only work 25-27 if you are scoring above 100% for efficiency, so the incentive doesn't really help."
good,Good pay. Great support managers.  Terrible upper management. Overnight people have to do whatever 2nd shift didn't finish and whatever 1st shift should be doing as well as what over nights is meant to do. It is one of those job s that in the end you wish you never had. The people i worked with and the support manager were the only reasons i stayed as long as i did.
good,"As an overnight produce associate my day started with dating our product to assure quality and culling all fruits and vegetables. I then checked through everything I culled for any food that was still donatable so and placed all acceptable food in containers to be donated. Any refuse food I was to weigh, record, and then discard in our compost bins.  After this process I would take inventory of what is left on the floor and replenish what I could while arranging all merchandise in a neat and appealing manner. My next and most difficult responsibility was to remove produce from the wet wall in order to clean and sanitize the storage shelves and inner parts of the wall and then replace all moved merchandise. Finally I would be required to organize the cooler in a date specific manner before freight arrived."
good,"Good Company"
good,I love Walmart and I do love shopping there but working at Walmart was never a good experience as I found out on the ground. The top management is good but at the department level the supervision I would say is very poor and lacks carrying out responsibilities without partiality. The top management needs to tackle this as the end result would be loosing all the talented personnel  that Walmart as a company would have tapped in to. No body likes working at a place where your feel sidelined because of your of ethnicity.
good,Wal-mart is always busy and fast paced. i loved the fast paced environment.  always something to do and keep the employees busy.I learned to do interviews when asked. the workplace is very friendly with other co-workers.
good,"I know in many cases people my are not thrilled to enter work. Throughout my work day it's very rushed and hard. My job usually requires a lot of running around the store and to the parking lot. In all I learned many different qualities that I am entirely grateful for. The management their as a whole isn't really great. In all the managers there, there was only about 2 or 3 exceptional managers. The store manager was forced to step down and move locations. I would request for days off in the proper about of time and did not receive them because my manager looked at them too late."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is helping families and making people happy . Seeing little kids get so excited when I assist in getting them a pet fish with all the pretty colors overjoys me
good,"A typical day for cashier:"
good,"Is a good place to work and provide excellent customer service. I learned to adapt to different work areas and willing to learn new things everyday. The hardest part of the job is not being full time which is bad for me, i've been in the company for five years and i don't have any health benefits at all. The most enjoyable part of my job is finishing what i have been told to do, and meet new people from different countries."
good,"Very safety conscious and very aware of having an inclusive work culture. Pay not very good, but you get profit sharing after a while and have the opportunity to buy stock. Lots of food wasted in the produce department. You are made to throw it out if past due date, even if it's still good."
good,"I only worked at Walmart for about seven months, but the time I spent there was not bad. I enjoyed helping customers and had a great time working with other associates. The only problem I had, however, was the terrible scheduling system. I am a student, and therefore require a flexible schedule. This is not something Walmart could provide; I would submit a time change two months in advance and still receive shifts that were not part of my availability four months later. I do not know if it is the computer or the management, but either way, something needs to change."
good,"Walmart is a decent company, but very political, favoritism runs rampant. No real life after long hours and horrible customers. Associates can be childish, but they do offer good benefits, and incentives to upper management."
good,Overall a decent place to work but can be very stressful at times. Turn over rate is very high. But a good place to advance your customer service skills.
good,"THIS JOB IS NOT FOR THE WEAK. The job is very high in demand, but the work you put in pays off! There are many opportunities for bonuses and raises. I worked in freezer, but have a metal ankle which did not allow me to work with out being in pain, was transferred to store and I hated it!"
good,Working at Walmart was a good experience for me. I was able to learn how to manage supply and demand by stocking and ordering merchandise. The team attitude was hit and miss depending on the management at the time. Which helped me see how working at any level as a team player can improve the whole work environment.
good,I worked there for almost a year and it had its up and downs. a lot of stuff there do to laziness was messed up. freight was in wrong places and began to get stressful but if you can get past that its a cool job to make a check.
good,"a typical day at work."
good,I would go into the day not knowing what I was going to be doing. If one department was short they would put you there not knowing anything about that specific area.
good,"I like working in the Walmart store in Quartertown, PA, but I started working in August of 2012 and never met my Crossmark supervisor until October 31st - very poor in my opinion. Thank goodness I had prior experience in Knoxville, TN beforehand. "
good,"We were always busy and never had enough cashiers, causing me to always stay late, never enough managers to be there on the floor when you need them, everything was scattered and unorganized"
good,"Moving around in walmart gets you alot of experience, but the managers are horrible. Only care about numbers instead of helping their employees. Pay is horrible, only good for kids in school or part time job."
good,good workers some managers are nice some don't care about their workers at all you get great hours but the amount of work doesn't match with the money
good,I liked  working there when I was there .the only problem  I had was when i had a car accident  and was out for a while they acted like didn't  want to give me any hours .so my husband  told me to stay home with th children
good,Being a cashier is extremely simple with cash handling being the most stressful part. Daily tasks and responsibilities are easily accomplished. Management is usually very accommodating.
good,empresa enfocada en sus clientes y el comercio aprendes a hacer inventarios como mantener en orden una bodega y al alcanza los productoss
good,"although my time with the company was not enjoyable, I like the fact they promote within the company....if you want to grow, they make it easy for you to advance"
good,Really enjoyed working at this company. You get to meet new people different environment the staff was pretty much ok. We had a lot of different managers a lot as well
good,"While working at Walmart I learned a great deal more about retail and how it works than in previous years. Very team oriented, fast paced in the department I worked in. Always on your feet, and constantly moving."
good,Manage is overall ok. work place culture is familiar. being engage with customer and help them resolve their problem is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"I enjoyed this job because I started out as a cashier and quickly advanced into a Customer Service Manager. Yeah there were some grumpy customers to deal with but hey that's the challenge you get when you deal with customers. It makes you think about the best possible outcome where both you and your customer walk away happy. It's rewarding. So, working at Walmart, you get these interactions to build experience. Plus you get the extra responsibility."
good,"When i worked at walmart, things were a mess. Management didn't really care, and the culture was of people who wanted to get out of there. I did enjoy the people, but that was about it."
good,"Worked as a First Shift In-Stock associate. Not a bad job, just not stellar. Generally speaking the middle management of the store isn't bad, but upper management is a bit too close to corporate to care all that much about the individual. Nobody is mean there or anything. Just jaded from the corporate retail life."
good,A typical day at work includes fighting to hit your rate. There's no such thing as working together as a team. There's a bunch of favoritism and the only advancement isn't moving up but moving to another department.
good,Working at Walmart was mediocre. The work was easy and the pay reflected the work. I did how ever learn a lot about cars from the people I worked with. Made the experience an enjoyable one.
good,Walmart is an ok company to work for. It's difficult to advance unless you are well liked by management. There are many skills you can learn at walmart
good,"I enjoy working with my fellow associates in the departments I am in. As a team we try to make our workdays go as fun and smoothly as possible. We are able to have a good time as well as get our jobs and tasks completed in a timely manner. In respect to management, things could be better. Many on the management team are about the money and not the family environment that used to exist."
good,"I loved working for Walmart, but they didn't offer full-time employment, didn't receive the raises we were told, and they definitely didn't work with the home life..."
good,worst managment ever they treat you like a slave. They have no care for any human beings other than them selves . the only good thing is the flexible hours and friendly associates.
good,Working here isn't great. You get bad hours for low pay. Most of the associates act like children and when asked to do their job they complain and usually dont end up doing it.
good,"This job is for children who is just starting college and need money. Main Manager didn't like taking calls, Management talk to you however they wanted to."
good,"For a individual just staring out, WalMart provides income. Tthere is not much room for advancement. There is a lot of job politics, but that's the nature of different personalities working together."
good,"was not a bad work environment, some of the associates were just very uneasy and negative. the manager was new but was doing a very good job. but i was not training how i was needed to be. cashier supervisor was never around to see if everyone was doing their job."
good,This is a launching pad to find a better job. There really is nothing else to say. High turn over rate and never enough hours. Always new people. Lack of consistent management.
good,"Relatively easy work with mostly nice people around. Most times I was given something to do then left with plenty of time to finish at my own pace. Management was disorganized and didn't seem to communicate with each other or resolve employee issues. I was given a discount card which was %5 off of anything in the store, except for food items, which I personally find a bit low-bar for a corporation the size of Walmart, but was a discount nonetheless. Relatively flexible scheduling and decent pay for the level of difficulty of the job."
good,"Walmart was okay to work for. Busy most of the time especially around the holidays. Most associates were friendly, job was enjoyable at times. Varied shifts, made it hard to plan anything. You have to be careful of your mistakes, three and you no longer work there. Started out with excellent benefits but the company got rid of most of them throughout the years (I was there for 11 years)"
good,"Walmart offered a friendly environment. A typical day at work consisted of picking up frate and checking it in and than restocking the walls; while attending to customers and maintaining a cleanly space. I learned how to multitasks very well and handle being thrown into new situations. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers,the right customers can make a persons day. The hardest part of the job was trying to efficiently attend to  daily task as well as attend to the impromptu task given everyday as well."
good,Fast paced work environment not much for study hours pay fluctuates high management turn over as well and presently has a low morale within the store I'm on employees
good,"Some managers does not like us coworkers helping each other doing certain jobs, managers have their favorite employee and give them credit for things they did not do, but overall I love my job I just believe I can improve my life, I have a great relationship with most of my coworkers that actually do their jobs."
good,"The job itself, honestly, wasn't difficult. However, the management overcomplicated the day-to-day tasks and employee structure. This prevented many employees from both doing their jobs adequately, as well as moving any direction on any career path within Walmart."
good,walmart is a job with nothing to special about it. management is alright. scheduling sucks unless you work the overnight shift. its fair pay for fair work.
good,Great place to work and get experience in general merchandise. I think that with better management practices they could be a better fit for future employees.
good,"If you understand the culture then you will advance.  They have their own language, goals, and issues.  They try to promote from within and encourage it. It worked well with the classes I am taking in accounting.  Management was willing to give me insights on what the different reports meant. Insightful."
good,If I would work there again I would work as an engineer when I graduate. It was okay but there are long hours of standing on your feet doing pretty much nothing as a cashier.
good,"Good first job place-- willing to work out a schedule, and demanding of results. Prepares for bigger jobs down the line, and able to transfer to new locations as needed."
good,I enjoyed working with the ppl at walmart. I did not like working for walmart tho. They do not care about their employees. I was let go due the absences caused by being pregnant I had doctors notes and that still wasnt good enough.
good,"It's what you make of it. It has its ups and downs. Your coworkers are the only reason why this job would be fun, or tolerable. Just make the best of it and do not let the customers get to you."
good,Too much emphasis on the bottom line. Needs to better care for employees. Too many scheduled work days in a row. Too much required away from the job ie. weekly conference calls from home
good,Some days were harder than others. I have no complaints when it comes to my paycheck. We were understaffed so we had to work harder most nights just to get our work done.
good,"Foi muito bom, aprendi a trabalhar em equipe pena que nao sao muitos profissionais"
good,I was back office support when I gave my notice.  I was moving and would no longer be able to full fill my position.  I was the invoicing associate in back office.  I worked in con-operation with receiving.  I tracked inventory and completed work requests from head office daily.  I had good managers.   I liked every part of my position.  I love working with people.
good,I would love to work there again. I really miss the residents and how we all would brighten each others day. Being a care giver allowed me to express the love I have to care for others loved ones.
good,You'll never be rewarded for the work you do. Use to be a good company to work for but has really gone down hill in recent years. Management seems clueless about the workings of the company.
good,It would have been a better experience if coworkers we're more inviting to the new hires. Also if coworkers left their bad attitudes and rudeness at home toward other coworkers. Now as a cashier I would have to have some customers that didn't have a very good day and they were upset and rude which that's okay there the customer I put a smile on my face greet them check them out and try to be as positive as I can because they are who pay us.
good,"Not the best environment with upset customers and management, schedule around school and go by your availability, may change your career preference to suit your needs or work towards promotion."
good,Management doesn't listen to employees or address issues. I was supposed to be moved to another department and they kept putting it off.kept asking manager when they would move me and never got a real answer
good,Can be a great place to work. When you choose what part of the store to work.... don't choose customer service or cashier. You will rip your hair out!
good,"Treat their employee's bad. The pay its not worth it for all the work that's applied for their working to do. Walmart is a well payed company that doesn't care bit about their employee's, only their money."
good,Typically most days are busy. When the stores have visits from district managers and above the stores are almost like chaos because the managers are frantically trying to get everything up to standard.
good,"Es una buena empresa para agarrar experiencia en atención al cliente, inventarios, pero no te dan oportunidad de crecimiento."
good,"Typical as a cashier your always busy, but some days if its slow your just staying around doing nothing. I learned that you have to recognize that everyone doesn't have the same morals and values as you. Some of the managers are okay, but when it comes to making sure you have hours everyone acts like they can't help you. They hire new people and they get all the hours and your lucky if you can get at least 20 hours every two weeks. I enjoy the people I have met and the opportunity to meet new people that I check out, and make better connections to people in different fields in the world."
good,"It was a fun great time to work at Walmart it was a hard working experience for me, the task where crazy challenges but I was able to deal with them, with the team I had."
good,"Walmart wasn't a bad place to work at the time, it was fun at times and other times it was like they had to many people wanting to be the boss so it was lacking structure at the time."
good,"You have to have a hard shell to work at this store, the management shows favoritism and doesn't treat their employees equally. The benefits are great but it isn't worth the everyday headache from the management team."
good,"una empresa muy comoda para trabajar! el empleo me gusto mucho. el unico problema es el pago, me parece muy bajo y con retraso. tengo que aclarar que yo dependia de la empresa de recursos humanos man power."
good,This will be the job for you if you love to be helping the community. You have to know how to communicate with others and remember to always have a smile on your face!
good,"If you apply for this job be sure to ask about all the new changes!!!!! There in the process of taking away anything good they had to offer very stressful job you are held to a very high standard and accountable for everything there's one way to get hired and a 1,000 was to get fired. Your first year you will work every weekend every holiday and change trucks 2-3 times a week the pay is good but you will earn every dime of it also there getting ready to put cameras in the trucks out and in facing also hooked to gps to see if your speeding or tailgating"
good,My peers at Wal-Mart were great friendly people but the hours the company asked us to work were poor as well as the conditions. I could work the closing shift one night and the opening shift the next or work six to seven days in a row.
good,Hardworking job great with great pay. You will get your butt kicked every single day. But the pay is good and benefits are decent. Be ready to sweat and run at all times
good,i used walmart as a stepping stone and kinda got to comfortable. they are good with working around your life schedule. they are always cutting hours or hire alot of people so you cant get alot of hours. they benefits it not worth anything you have to work there for at least a year just to get any type of benefits.
good,"Demanding position, minimal training with immediate placement on the floor. I felt ill prepared and the expectations were very high. I did enjoy many of my co-workers and feel that with adequate training I would have been more successful in my position."
good,"Amazing systems allow Walmart to move merchandise from suppliers to consumer. Always looking for ways to imrove the company. Expwerincing the sheer volume of sales at Wamart is amazAmazing systems Fast paced, 24/7 operation."
good,Buen ambiente peeo en mi opinion la forma de pago no es la correcga
good,"I started at one Walmart and transferred to another. Completely different work environments. No matter where you're at it has a fast paced environment and always something to do. This is if you do your job well. Otherwise you can slack off, stand around, and management wont do anything. One location was very easy going and the managers stuck in their positions, the other location had managers that jumped around departments. It's really hard to keep track of who you need to talk to sometimes."
good,"The management was horrible, rude, and not all on the same page. They had executives come through and they spoke to me like i was a dog. only good thing is the 1 hour lunch."
good,Management could learn to communicate store policies to associates better. Customers mainly try to work the system to get their way and many managers would break policy to keep them happy.
good,"Got scolded by one of the CSMs for smiling at a customer saying "" you are smiling because you haven't worked here long enough"". Miscommunication everywhere. When I was hired was told one thing and then a week later told another."
good,"Good job, met a lot of interesting people. I was given a lot of advancement opportunities of 10 years, some I made use of some I didn't, but they were there."
good,"This place will either help you out of a financial rut, or it will keep you locked in a world of stress and head ache. Management does their best, but with so many people above them breathing down their necks, It seems like they're always on top of the workers to do more with less. All I can say is, keep a sharp mind and do your best. If they say its not good enough, be prepared to find another job or transfer within  the company."
good,"Always Be on time, Be In Dress Code, Its very easy to move up, but hard at the same time"
good,"The work was easy, but the management had some issues. I was let go over a sick day so they view people as pretty much expendable unfortunately that was the worst part."
good,They consistently had too little staffing and would run everyone ragged. Always had an overwhelming amount of responsibilities to do and very unrealistic and unreasonable deadlines to do things. Upper management was very unfriendly and it was a very negative feeling work environment to be in.
good,"Minha avaliação pelo Walmart sempre foi um pensamento bom "
good,"The only thing I agreed with at Walmart was the pay rate. Other than that the mangers didn't take pride or care in their employees. Also, other employees would try and work less so that others could do all the work."
good,"The first 8 years were amazing in terms of personal and career growth.  Compensation for the long hours and sacrifices of family are the best in the business.  I really enjoyed my assignments to the point of calling it ""fun.""  The last three years were not as enjoyable.  It felt like there was an agenda to push out all managers, regardless of performance, that did not fit a specific profile.  Very sad to see some of the best managers I've ever had the privilege of working with pushed out of the company."
good,Walmart's Asset Protection Associate job is one of the best with the company but the job security is really low. APAs could be terminated at any moment as long as a customer complains loudly enough (or if someone from management has anything against them. I've seen it happen).
good,"working at walmart was a lot of hard work you wre on the go multitasking from start to finish, I had really great managers. the hardest part of the job there were 3 managers above me and none of them actually new what the other was doing so it could get a little confusing at times. the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be my coworkers great personalities and special orders on cakes I got to think outside of the box."
good,"While working at Walmart, I was able to adavance fairly quickly due to my work ethic but did experience a lot of favoritism from many managers, laziness from associates and an overall lack of accountability."
good,I have not major complaints honestly.  management would listen to concerns or issues.  whether or not they chose to find them actionable is another question.  If you want a set schedule this isn't the place for you.
good,Walmart is a good company to work for and there is room to move up in the company. The only bad thing is that you really have to know someone to move up in the company and I worked there for nine years and was only at a pay rate of 10.50 an hour. People just starting out came thought the door making right at what I was making or more.
good,It's ok but not the best place  to be at. I like the fact that I could work at different schedules. The managers have their picks of people in life...
good,"You start work in the back,then you gestate to the front and have to balance your mobile commanding officers, the needs of customers and your own duties."
good,This isn't a career. This is a job while your in school or currently home from the military. Also maybe if your retired and are in need of extra cash.
good,I like the people that I worked with until upper management started getting rid of people that been there for a long time. The morale of the store went down and I relocated. The store I moved to was terrible everybody was rude and half of the front and didn't do their job.
good,"Walmart offers great opportunities for its associate.  Benefits are decent, and when becoming salary, the pay is promising. One can learn so much, profit, paperwork, payroll, policies etc. "
good,"Showing hard work pays off, but working here you feel like you are expected  to do the work of 10 people. And you expected to learn many jobs, and get pulled from one job to other some days."
good,"I really hated being a cashier. I learned here that I am not good at dealing with people all day long, they are very rude. I didn't mind my coworkers too much, but I didn't really know anyone."
good,"Walmart isn't going anywhere as long as you can show up to work with a sense of urgency there is job security. It's a good place to work, and you can make a decent living. If you want to move up within the company it's all politics though. A lot of interviews are done but before you ever get there they know who they plan to promote. They go ""through the motions"". I have been on both ends of this, and it's frustrating to witness. Now they have a new promotion process and it's even worse than before."
good,unfortunately although they say you can advance to other departments it's not as easy as that> have been requesting to be transferred to fashion or health and beauty where my experience of over 12 years justifies they always have an excuse why they cant! The girls at the front end all know its because they dont wont to lose me on cash since I'm in the top 10% for scans per hours
good,There was always a lot of stress put on everyone because of having so much to get done. sometime there were not enough associates in the dept. and sometimes management would request thing and not be specific.
good,"I work the midnight shift. I stock shelves, manager duties, loading money into the self checkouts, running the money machine in the cash office and face the store to make it look clean for when we open."
good,"typial day at work: slow... a lot of cleaning "
good,As a cashier it got very boring. Conworkers were easy to get along with. They give you a break every two hours almost. Four hour shifts are common to get.
good,"It's a lot of work for little pay and the management was pretty bad. It started out good, but after they changed supervisors it down. Working nights is hard. If you don't have a kid then it might not be so hard, but with a kid in school, it's just insane."
good,You meet alot of people working at wal mart. The problem is you have to know someone to advance. You can not become manager unless you are close to another manager.
good,Started out as an inventory control specialist responsible for receiving the general merchants trucks and staging them and building the ad displays weekly.
good,"Walmart was a good and stable job. I worked in the fitting room department so I helped with sales, put clothes back and let people in fitting rooms. I also organized the clothes in my section of the store."
good,"I have worked for Wal-mart for 15 years now, and feel the workplace culture has only worsened.  Walmart was once a decent place to work.  Now, I would not advise anyone to work there for more than 3 years (if they don't like retail).  Pharmacy can be one of the more stressful areas to work.  Sometimes I feel like the retail setting and pharmacy are like oil and water.  From customer complaints to the more rigorous requirement being set from home office, it has become a place that is definitely not worth the  pay.  But in spite of this, I have been blessed over the years to have very good managers.  It just disappoints me that upper management continues to roll out all of these ridiculous, technical rules that are sometimes strangling.  There are many surrounding locations that can barely keep good technicians, let alone good pharmacy managers.  I often hear many managers say that unless you REALLY love your job, it's now not worth having the position of pharmacy managers.  I hate to type a mostly pessimistic review, but the truth is prevalent.  If you like retail and love being a pharmacy technician, by all means go for a career at Walmart.  But if not, don't work there unless it is truly short-term (3-5 yrs.) or you are desperate."
good,"I wasn't there long. It's not somewhere you want to work forever(poor pay and not much advancement), but it could be worse. You show up, do your time, and get out of there as fast as you can. Customers are the worst part just like any retail job."
good,"management sucks. turnover tare is very high because of this. i only lasted a year because of the way the place is so poorly run. work environment with coworkers is awesome, but management made me HATE going in every night."
good,"Good overall. Work basically was average. No one was ever mean, everyone was always understanding. The only problem was it was far away from my home. Besides that it was enjoyable."
good,Customers and staff upset because there are never enough lanes open. The pay is good but it was just too much for me too deal with. Sometimes you are required to stay past your sceduled hours and work departments you know nothing about. Management never wanted to help out.
good,Very goal driven company that always requires more from its people while at the same time cutting hours and the number of people to carry out work duties.
good,"Good company to work for ,only if they hire the right people.I was surrounded by great customers and that's one of the reason I stayed with the company."
good,"Worlds largest retailer is a great place to learn the foundation of retail. It is a difficult environment to develop and be promoted within, but there are so many areas to work in."
good,It's always a busy day at walmart. You stock items every now and then. The management is okay. Coworkers are fun to be with. You do a lot.The best thing about working here is that your coworkers are really helpful and kind.
good,"Worked here for 3 years as part time, It was ok for just goin through school. I like the flexible hours and how we could switch days with one another if we had to,"
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with while there, the only problems I had was their ability to be flexible with a demanding schedule. I have two children 1 is 6 years old and the other is 2 and I was at the time a single mom, so I needed to have flexibility in order to meet the demands of my children. I understand that it's hard to make a schedule that works for everyone, but there was some serious favoritism that was shown when the managers there worked with the repeatedly changed schedule of one associate and not another, was willing to look over absences of one associate that had no note, just a verbal explanation, and not another who had notes explaining their absences was due to their sick children. I do not agree with the treatment there at all but the actual department I worked in, there was amazing people and I loved every bit of what I did."
good,A typical day at work stayed busy and that's what I liked I didn't get bored. Management never helped. The most enjoyable was meeting new people and helping out the customers knowing they left happy.
good,"If you want to dedicate your whole life to climbing a ladder to achieve the next ""promotion"" to some oddly titled position only available inside Walmart culture, this is the place for you."
good,"It's Walmart. What do you expect? 9 hour shifts, and there is no such thing as a part time worker. Don't work with your schedule if you're in school. Managers don't care about employees, only that work gets done so they look good. Good money and good people other than managers, so that's a plus."
good,"Decent place to work starting out.  Chance to learn life skills like inventory control, money handling (as in cashiering), and heavy duty skills like running a forklift."
good,"I enjoyed working here for the most part. The management was getting a little to aggressive with the timing they wanted everything done, but overall was a good job."
good,they work you like a slave. you're just a number t them. thy don't care about anyone. they change rules when they want to and the turn over rate is high
good,"Very friendly staff members, but some management could use some better people skills, work is average what they tell you when you start working is what you do while you work there."
good,"Managers were very poor with scheduling, and had bad attitudes and would threaten to let you go. Even was threatened to be fired for taking bathroom breaks because of medical conditions."
good,Its a good place to learn about working with a team and how to treat and deal with customers.There are some advancement oppourtnites dependigng on the store your in.
good,Its a good company dont get me wrong but the manager that I had would schedule me crazy hours when I still was in school and traveling for my sport(hockey) I couldnt balance all three at once
good,"I enjoyed working there, but feel they expected alot for what they paid.  Management was poor.  It was hard to get a steady schedual ,and that made it hard to plan a life around."
good,"Stocking shelves, running the register, handling money and customer service. It wasn't a bad job I just worked the wrong hours for being a single mom. I loved meeting the people and learning new things."
good,The work is as expected. Faced-paced and to the point. I get along with my coworkers and enjoy the commodity. I enjoy working with the public and I have many customers that are elderly or disabled who come down my lane because I take extra measures to help them.
good,They were very rude and disrespectful. Always telling me im to slow. Yelled. Never talked to me or showed me different ways. The co workers were very nice though. Its just management. I didnt feel like part of the teem and very unwelcomed.
good,"Loyalty is a one way street. You are told how important you are as long as you are willing to give up any attachment to your own development. If you are in a store with a great team, then it is a great experience. Home office does not care about the store management you just don't matter and there is a type of freedom in that."
good,"Walmart is a good place to start a customer service career. You develop customer service skills there at a fairly rapid place, and also the challenges of working there will also develop you some handy problem solving skills. Overall my time at Walmart was something I value greatly as it has partially shaped me into the worker that I am today."
good,"Walmart was a great place to work at,  but management was poor. Vision & dental insurance is really good but health insurance not so great. I learned how to decorate cakes and ended up loving it."
good,"The workload was light but stressful when it was busy."
good,It is a good place to work if you need just a part time job. Some management was good and others were not as good. Customers are not a joy to deal with most of the time.
good,I enjoyed working with the Walmart family however management is the worst. Employees aren't respected as such and are often over worked. The customers are generally friendly and the job pisistions are pretty straight forward.
good,"Some of the associates are very immature and like to spread rumors and start drama. I was okay for a while. When some new associates came in, the drama started. You cannot even trust management. You can tell them something in confidence and they will tell someone else. It is too much of a headache. So do not go to Geneva Walmart to work."
good,"The work is hard and moves quickly, but employees are compensated fairly. Managers are required to complete many tasks at a time, but the associates are always willing to help out where needed."
good,Management does not communicate well. Management treats associates poorly. Benefits are fair for full-time workers. Pay could be better. Store manager of Daphne store is a tyrant.
good,I worked there for about 9 months and I would have to say I enjoyed the job for most of the time. The Management was decent and for most part very fair.
good,"Managers were treating lower employees bad other then that it's an easy first good. Good pay for what you do, a lot of customer service. Decent amount of hours"
good,"Walmart is a very competitive company with a lack of leadership from higher levels, Structure and change are not communicated properly to those responsible for the result of the changes."
good,Early morning shifts great hours great pay sometimes it was frustrating management wasn't all that great really rude and disrespectful but all in all it was a good job.
good,"Working at Walmart was okay. The work was easy, but working there made it seem like I wasn't getting anything free time for myself. The management was descent, it seem like they were always to busy to talk to the employees with issues."
good,"It's a great place to work for some, frustrating for others. Management pushes on those that work hardest and plays favorites. Micromanagement is abundant. Pay is decent for the job description. Room for advancement is endless."
good,"I liked the job itself, I just didn't like the way management played favorites and there were a lot of double standards.  Hardest part of the job was finding enough time to get all your work done, most enjoyable part was being busy enough where the night would go by quickly.  Working with my coworkers was enjoyable too."
good,"There was no room for growth. "
good,"fácil operación laboral, compañerismo y reconocimiento de actividades."
good,"It was once again just very bad experience. The people were rude. They always snatched money and debit cards and when asked nicely to place their card in the right direction to swipe, they rudely got upset and offended me."
good,"Walmart is definitely a job for those who are able to deal with rough customers. The job isn't super difficult, but it isn't always the most enjoyable."
good,"Very good job to learn customer service, but the management is horrible. Took me about 6 months to realize how bad the management was when it came to running things, schedules were always messed up, they'd leave us short handed, they make a mistake and try to blame the employee."
good,"I was not properly trained for my position as optician, and the supervisor was unreasonably judgmental of my performance-instead of trying to help me succeed, she assumed I was doing my own thing and didn't pay enough attention to my training. I gained valuable experience and liked interacting with customers and providing for their needs, but it was an overall difficult experience."
good,"I liked assisting the customers in getting what need, but I did not like being assigned to an area that I was unfamiliar with; such as the plant and garden section. There was no proper training given in order for me to give the customer the correct information about a product."
good,job pays good but I only work like 15 to 20 hours a week fast past but not enough work I need a job with more hours got vto a lot and it was very stressful
good,Walmart overall is not the best place to work at all. The people I work with all act like children and always pick in the new guys or anyone they feel like. The pay isn't that good either all though it has gone up a lot since I first started working there. Everyone who works here seems to have an attitude issue including the managers.
good,"There is no chance to move up in the company unless you are friends with the managers. They have unrealistic views on how store should be run as well as understaff every department, and they suffer greatly for it."
good,"Come to work get the job done just right and on time."
good,Management is horrible and you're limited on success.i wouldn't recommend working here unless it's the last resort.other than that they offer barely above minimum wage and isn't flexible
good,I'd got back if I had to. Rather not. Could have been worse though. Most of the bad stuff happened because of horrible customers. Most of the people were nice though
good,We were always under staffed at the Wal-Mart that I worked at and the management was not great at all.  We couldn't get everything done on time on some days due to the lack of employees.
good,"trabajo diario llegar limpiar area de trabajo, actualizar dos bases, enviar correos a todas las tiendas y hablaer con ellas, elaborar plan de descarga, de igual manera elaborar formatos de demoras."
good,U work alone and at a medium paste. The people are friendly because u have to have good customer service. The environment was busy because we are open 24/7.
good,"they can only hire you as part time for the first year, and they are very strict about hours. other than that, thats about it, management was alright."
good,It was an overall just to do it. i did not enjoy it. the managers required too much. it was not organized at all. work place was always dirty. it was only good because i got paid.
good,"I was responsible for customer service, stocking, inventory & closing duties of the Deli."
good,"Usually working alone or with one other guy to clear the parking lot of all the shopping carts. Exhausting in the heat. The Wal-Mart I worked at was understaffed and unorganized, we were constantly scrambling to try and get things done without the proper resources."
good,"Empresa organizada e dinâmica,chances de crescimento profissional."
good,Wlamart is an ok place To Work. The pay is not to good. I feel the workers should get paid more than what they get. The hour i worked were not to good.
good,"I was hired as renovation worker 1st, then transferred to overnight stocker when store reno completed, and then transferred to maintenance, nightshift"
good,"This is a place that will work you to the bone. They have pretty good compensation; such as awards, lunches, good pay, and good health benefits. It is easy to get fired though."
good,I did not really enjoy my time at Wal-Mart. Unfortunately most associates are not professional. Many have a poor work ethic and it was never a fun place to work.
good,I served the food. Made the food. Cleaned. Cooked. Did dishes. The hard part of the job was closeing by your self when someone would not show up and dis not have the help. The fun part of the job was the customers and working with good people. I also stocked the frezzer and the refrigerator
good,"I work as  claims assoc.  receiving assoc.  dept. manager. I had a good management team. I enjoyed helping the customer.  As the dept. manager, I make the schedule for 10 assoc. Order items for the dept."
good,"As a manager we come in and walk our areas to make sure side counters are fill and faced, take a look at features to ensure that they are fill and on order.  Then we make sure we talk to our associates to ensure they have everything they need."
good,If you want something for now it's a good job. The pay is decent for the work.  Mainly stocking the shelfs. Checking out customers.  Zone ing. And helping people find things.
good,"After working there for six years I love the place. However its not that great, very low morale, promotion chances are ok but you need to either be liked by someone (being the best for the job will not get you it), or willing to take a bad position no one wants. The management team when I was there was horrible at communication and didn't care about their employees at all. The management team has changed quite a bit since I left though so that may have changed. All in all if you need a job its stable and will pay the bills, but don't expect to move up fast or make a lot of money."
good,"Falta equilibrio entre vida personal y laboral, jornadas de 14 a 16 hrs diarias."
good,A lot of favoritism and pity. Been there long enough to advance and they keep skipping over me.  I'm tired of it. It's better working for a supercenter
good,Its a job. I learned how rude and crazy people can really get working here. I worked in a brand new store so there were many complications at first. They also changed management while I was there so it was a little hectic.
good,i liked the people i worked with. i didnt ask to do this review. I liked working on the Mod team better than stocking. I liked stocking infants and the pharmacy.
good,"There was always room to improve at Walmart, I personally moved up in position at least 3 times in the year I worked there which could be said is uncommon in reality if you put forth the best you can and put in for stuff you can go far."
good,nothing to talk about. they change rules when they want too. They tell you how and to report anything out of place or over shelf count. Than tell you not to worry about it. Just stock .
good,I feel over worked for the pay but i learned a lot of valuable skills. I dont feel like the work load is very fair to hard workers. I feel used because im willing to work but some people get to do no work and get away with it.
good,"I felt that Walmart had a very strict working environment. The management and corporate supervisors were always coming up with new rules that associates were required to follow, and everything that employees did was closely monitored either by security camera or our cash register logins."
good,"Walmart has it's up and down depending on the management. Has an individual who wants more out of life I don't like companies who limits me to only working for them. My whole available in my day cannot be devoted to only one place. I have a child, and I go to school. Then if not for these things I try to increase my income by having another job."
good,Enjoyable with alot of slf reliance in many of the positions. Usually left alone in most stocking areas and departments to your own devices and completions of daily routine and work.
good,Walmart is definitely a great place to shop but not a good place to work there be if it's the workers and all are not good for me when I found another place to work  I felt so much better
good,Walmart is a great place to work but the pay is very low. The customer are nice and the mangers are helpful. I would love to go back only if they bump the pay up a little bit.
good,"A typical day at work was slow. I learned a lot about customer service and how to resolve conflicts. Management was confusing to say the least, never really knew exactly what they wanted (they didn't even know what they wanted). Workplace was great, all the associates were friendly. Hardest part was having to redo certain projects due to management changing their minds. Most enjoyable part was helping everyone that needed it."
good,Las buenas practicas son las cuales mantienen en lo alto a Walmart aunque a veces hace falta que su persona como gerentes de tienda tengan más madures emocional y sepan tratar de mejor manera el capital humano ya que con ello es con lo que la empresa sale adelante.
good,The thing with walmart  is that you have to be customer  oriented. If  you do not enjoy  serving people than it may not be the place for you. Good people are employed there and do a very good job.
good,"working at Walmart was a great experience, and a good opportunity to learn and adapt to the workplace. The work is simple and the staff are friendly and provide assistance to others."
good,"As a Cashier I would say its probably like any other cashiering job, only difference is if you didn't price match. I think that is the only down side. They're strict on cashiers on ""not to give out price matches without AD"" yet, a customer will ask for a supervisor and a supervisor will just let them have it, which continues that cycle of customers not taking us serious. So then you just allow the customers to get those matches (if fairly priced) and you get in trouble. So management, supervisors, and cashiers need to be there for each other. Other than that its a good place to work. Possible to move up if you want which is really great,"
good,"Primary roles include scanning coupons, applying discounts, processing payments, and ringing up sales on computerized cash register cleanliness, customer services"
good,"Working at Walmart was okay I did learn a lot,and the online grocery was something exticing and new to learn.Walmart really need to focus on there mangers and how they treat there associates,also provide better pay and more hours for the multiple positions the mangers expect you to do.would love if Walmart offered more full time position !"
good,"This was a great place to work, the management at my store was just not as good as the job so it didn't make it as fun. I worked in Lawn and Garden starting off so I liked my position and my co-workers."
good,"Wasn't a bad place to work, a lot of nice people but working with 3 children to take care of with them not being as flexible and understanding I had no choice but to leave the company."
good,"Very easy but unorganized. Can be fast pace and very crowded when stocking. The management team is very unorganized and unfair, making the work place harder than it should be."
good,average experience with said company but working conditions were less than favorable all I did was oil changes & tires batteries wiper & bulb installation.
good,"Its okay. Somedays are good and some days are not so good. Its like any other typical job. Most of all its what you put into work and how you deal with the work environment. I like the environment, i was just bothered by the short hours and always coming home after 10:00 to my small kids."
good,Wal-Mart is very diverse. It is a great place to learn new abilities to help you go further. I have learned a great deal from my time there. The most difficult part of working there is being thanked for always going above and beyond your normal job duties and the lack of respect from co-workers and management.
good,"While working at Walmart I displayed great customer service skills."
good,"It is a decently easy job. But management can really be a hand full and customers can get to be a lot.  But for the wage and requirements to get in, it is a decent job."
good,I didn't enjoy my time at the location. It seemed to be constant confusion and not enough communication. Although I got provided the opportunity for promotion pretty quickly; Once in the position my job description was never clearly projected to me which caused for confusion in the workplace.
good,"Walmart Technology has much potential, however there is a need for radical change if they are going to beat the competition.  They're in that process of change right now."
good,"Walmart does not value their employees. Pay and health insurance are not very good. The 10% employee discount does not count towards food items. No overtime ever, and many hour cuts. Hardwork is not recognized."
good,This is a starting job. That allows to build strong work ethics. In order to prepare a person for future jobs. It teaches you to be dependable and different traits.
good,A typical day at Dairy Queen was usually very fast pace with little room for breaks considering that I always worked during the lunch rush. Overall the environment was friendly and the employees got along.
good,"A quick-paced and demanding environment that's great for those who like to work under pressure. But be wary, management will always come out so poorly"
good,"As far as hours and wages, Walmart is fantastic place to work. If you need hours, as a cashier, you will most likely get them. You are eligible for yearly salary increases based on your performance. However, the work environment at my location, is not good, to say the least."
good,its walmart. it is what it is its a job to help you get to your next job. it doesnt pay much and usually the managers expect you to do three peoples jobs by yourself (stocker). but co workers are fun sometimes and you meet really everyone because everyone goes to walmart.
good,I unloaded freight from semi trailers. I learned how to drive 4 different types of forklifts. the management team was lacking. they were given free range and not held accountable for poor decisions. the workplace culture was fun. lots of laughter on the dock. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people who didn't want to do their job. The most enjoyable part was making new friends and getting to work with them daily.
good,The only bad thing that i can say is that the pay was below par. Other than that it was great to work there and i miss the people i worked with and worked for
good,"don't really take the time to explain tasks "
good,"the managers require you to do things that do not even fall under your job description. I hated my time there because the managers would not be willing to adjust schedule due to extracurricular activities that were going on at school. Some customers were really bad, and that is why I decided to resign after spending one year working at Walmart."
good,I didn't have a pleasant experience working here. I had a couple managers spreading rumors about me. I also found out i was pregnant while working here and they decided they'd put me into a heavier lifting section. Although my experience was bad my husband has been there almost a year now and he loves it.
good,"Um bom lugar para se trabalhar, onde se aprende várias funções e novos conhecimentos, há oportunidades internas mas são pouco aproveitadas,muitas vezes por conta da própria politica da empresa."
good,hours are not dependable this is not a good place if you have responsibilities the managers need classes on how to communicate with employees respectfully
good,I loved my job working at Walmart.  The management however was a mess.  The rules and regulations were being changed every night so the employees were confused as to how we were going to do our work and not get into trouble if the rules kept changing.
good,It was  fun job. But its not what I could do forever .... It started getting harder for me when I ended up working in meat department things were to heavy...I started getting sick
good,typical work day would be being told to stock an unrealistic amount of pallets before lunch. while having lunch they would hurry us to finish and told us to get back to work as soon as possible and push another unrealistic amount of pallets.
good,Great company just got to get in to it use to fast food environment...Wish the manager was available when I need them to be ...Great job just got to get use to the retail environment
good,"You are pulled all over the store to every department, even without proper training in those areas. You are continually given more and more work without the proper resources or people to accomplish the job, while others stand around and talk. Poor management abilities from management."
good,"Wal-Mart was a decent job, but position I worked at wasn't particularly the position that would help my employment maturity. Me being a College Student and the profession I am wanting to get in, the position was a bit of distraction to personal interest. The environment was cool place to work nonetheless."
good,"they ask more from you then they are willing to pay, they want you to be safe but it is near to impossible to do it safely in the time they give you. Besides that it ain't the worst place to work."
good,"A job that teaches you the ins and outs of customer wellness, and allowing you to provide your service to the best of your ability. Encouraging that Walmart is a great start."
good,A typical day at walmart would be greeting customers. Making sure they were satisfied. Having conversation with customers. Keeping our isles clean and neat.
good,I like the hours I work. It is stressful and management doesn't always understand all the job codes and what they involve to get the jobs done. Most of the old incentives have been changed last year and they took away a lot.
good,"Has a great selection of hours, Very fast paced work environment, Needs Training improvements, Wage is low for the work load expected. Ongoing obstacle of staff shortage"
good,"Very busy, high volume products moving in/out, leadership needs improvement, very physical, friendly atmosphere(mostly), company needs more family time, always working stat holidays"
good,This fast paced environment is not for the faint of heart. They have a can do approach will not stop at anything to meet there goals. They are quick to replace full time experienced workers  with part time workers with less knowledge to meet timelines.
good,"Although building up the store from the ground up was very uplifting. It was not so when the store was running. The typical day was actually productive and also builds communication skills. But the management that I had did not particularly take a liking to me, nor other male workers. We all had no idea why this was so, but for this reason, the workplace did not pose as a bright and happy work environment for me. the most enjoyable part was being able to serve customers and build relationships with the local shoppers."
good,This was my very first job and overall it was a pretty okay experience.  Earned close to minimum wage due to a lack of experience but the management was extremely gracious in trying their best to let me earn as much as possible. Coworkers and general environment were friendly though the customers and work were occasionally tedious.
good,"A fun place to work overall, however if you have any mental disabilities i wouldnt recommend it. The managers do not tend to be understanding in that respect but otherwise its a nice workplace."
good,You only get anywhere if you kiss butt. The best workers don't necessarily get the opportunities. Many of the policies are subjective and managers will bend them to get rid of people they do not want.
good,"I saw very different management styles and it showed me how I do not want to be but it was a learning experience. I know that I want to be a manager that is for the people not against them. That is what I faced at Walmart, managers that did not care for their employees."
good,"What i have learned working at Wal-Mart us that  you"
good,I work as a seasonal department when I start working for 3 month and they change me to the front till. so my experience is god and bud but I would say it is good place to work in general.
good,"Not a bad place to work, good pay, lunch break for pharmacists, over all not a bad job. The rules were strict and they did an average job of training you for what was needed to be done."
good,My work as a cart pusher was fast paced and social as well as physically taxing. I very much enjoyed doing the work but the management had a habit of changing the schedule without telling you and calling you in last possible second.
good,"I had a lot of fun working for Walmart but when my daughter was sick, she had seizures, asthma's problems they told me to take a lead for a month and when I came back my management position was taking from me without my knowledge."
good,Una empresa buena económicamente pero esclavizante con sus empleados ya que no autorizan horas extras y hay que quedarse más tiempo
good,I have worked for walmart for altogether 4 years and I love the benefits. I sometimes dislike the hours given and my job security wasn't stable due to me having a special needs child and being unable to apply for FMLA or LOA because I was part-time and those benefits were not available to me.
good,"My job was really busy but ive allways liked staying busy all the time anyway. I did like what I did from day to day, but I do think things should of been a lot better."
good,Constant customer interaction which I enjoy.  Management can improve on communications skills with associates. I learned to manage with one to two cashiers per day for an 8 hour shift at this highly-pace grocery store.
good,Most of the time the management was only fair to some of the workers. You follow the rules and most of the time it would not get you anywhere. Customers notice more of how the employees are treated. Your CSM are push to the limits and not rewarded only get in trouble for things that are not in their control.
good,I have really enjoyed working for the Wal-Mart DC. I enjoy my job and enjoy all the people that I work with! I have been with this company for 17 years and feel that it is time to move on.
good,I enjoyed being around some of the people but some were rude. I didn't enjoy the hours they would give me. I never understood why i would need to stay until midnight when I was only a day cashier.
good,"Although I was old enough to sell alcohol, since I was in high school they still demanded that I call on a CSM to check out alcohol. It would always take a CSM 10-20 minutes to arrive at my station, by that time the customer either did not want the product anymore or was irritated. There was a CSM who checked alcohol out on my account anyway which could have gotten me arrested."
good,The pay was okay but the hours for overnight stockers at my particular store were a bit too much. The co-workers were easy to get along with and everyone knew everyone. It's not a job that allows you to do much of anything else outside of it.
good,The company it not bad to work for in general the problem most of the time is staffing an poor leadership plenty of work to keep you busy customers are hit an miss as to nice or rude
good,"Although working at Walmart is time consuming,the company does provide benefits such as PTO and health care for part time/full time employees. The company also offers and employee discount after 3 months"
good,Working  overnight at Wal-Mart is a tough task but it turns you in to a hard worker cause of the work load you have to do in a certain amount of time. But I stock the store at night
good,It was alright for awile until hours got cut short and they started firing people. It was kinda hard when hours got cut short and made us stay over but the higher ups didnt want us to stay over
good,Good company but several employees do not embrace Company values. I enjoy customer service but Walmart made treating customers special cut their bottom line.
good,"As a cashier you can make a difference in the experience of peoples shopping choices."
good,Walmart was nice to keep me when I was their but 7.25 too low back then. Although job was easy. They turned my unemployment down. Also gov wont give disability due to it.
good,"A good starter job,I worked as a cashier for 2 years then was moved to the deli,I really wasn't given much choice cause my step daughter was a CSM and family can't work in the same department together"
good,"I did not enjoy being in this department, there was alot of backlash due to alot of misunderstanding of what was going on.  I did learn alot about the stuff that was on the racks and helped customers get to what they needed to get."
good,"The hiring process was a bit overwhelming and unprofessional being that there was multiple people in orientation at once, felt rushed and not fully trained the right way."
good,"The job itself wasn't bad or even hard however, the way management treats you will make you debate weather or not the job is worth keeping. Pay and benefits aren't bad but, I don't recommend staying long"
good,"Me encargo de ver que mi área este limpia, que los productos en exposición estén adecuados para su venta. Me encargo del control de entradas y salidas del producto (PEPS) y en ocasiones preparo ciertos alimentos como sushi. Durante mi horario de trabajo laboro solo."
good,In the Tire Lube  Express the rules are constantly changing and does not always abbide by what policy is and when asked about the change we are told it's always something new
good,"Many positions fall under ""customer first scheduling"" meaning your hours change from week to week. The pay is good compared to similar positions in other companies. There are numerous positions in the company so advancement is available. Management only shows up when they want to assign blame for some failure but then they disappear until the next screw up."
good,"as far as benefits and chances of growth, Wal-Mart is a good job. however management and staff can be terrible at times. the company is very demanding and not so understanding."
good,Walmart Walmart Walmart it's all about the roll back baby this is a good place to work for you just have to be able to deal with a diverse group of people that's not including the customers met some good people there
good,"Walmart was a very fun place to work, but the management was horrible and they left me weeks without work. I was a frozen dairy stocker and I was not getting the respect that I should have."
good,Works well with college and my daily life for the most part though other employees tend to fight.  Many times they were very willing to work with me to help to better achieve my educational goals though management may sometimes be difficult with other subjects.
good,"the job was for the most part i consider easy, but my co-workers were not enjoyable to work with, the people who were supposed to train me rarely showed up, and there was no one to take over to teach me what to do. After a couple weeks I learned how to do everything myself, working alone most of the time."
good,"Very boring, but great pay and benefits........ The managers are a little rude but I pray they will do better. Believe in god and everything will fall into place"
good,"Good place to work. Sometimes management can make job very stressful. Trying to advance at all is a big joke, as an hourly associate, I have interviews multiple times for multiple positions that are bare minimum management. They do not promote within store half the time. It's discouraging."
good,"Not a bad place to work, just slot of favoritism, cut hours short staff st times, you get free lunches sometimes, some managers have big heads, you get a bonus after 6 months of employment, okay healthcare if you go a lot, life insurance stock plan and a lot of other benefits Walmart offers. Good company if you don't mind working on weekends or holidays not for a family person."
good,"Customer service manager"
good,"I enjoyed my position here in the vision center. However, ,I feel like it was managed poorly and it affected the way I was able to help our customers. It was severely understaffed on most days and made for a very stressful and overwhelming workday with dissatisfied customers/patients."
good,my drive to work is far and sometimes dangerous as my car veers in winds..I do enjoy working for Walmart...but the hours are all over the place...feel like there is no family time. They pay very well. We do fun events for our associates which they seem to enjoy. Walmart use to be all about family...not so much any more...very sad.
good,There really wasn't any type of leadership or real advancement within the company unless you knew this person who knew this person so on and so forth.
good,"I love everyone I work with. Management is awful. Varies with each store. I love the area I work in also (fitting room). If you have issues, you can call this ethics number and get things fixed within work and be anonymous."
good,"The team is primarily comprised of fresh out of college students in their mid-early twenties. Lead by ""Big Brother"" fraternity types.  Typical 9-5, and in need of diversity among their employees."
good,"Walmart is no longer a sure thing. The company is too big, too bureaucratic, too conservative, and too stubborn to make the changes it needs to survive."
good,A company that will always be around and is maintaining their low cost leadership throughout all the market changes that continue to happen over the years.
good,The co management team was very disrespectful and clueless.  Never knew if i was gonna be able to be put in a department and finish before they would yank me out and do some one elses work.
good,"A typical working day, taking care of Business requirements related to ongoing Projects.  "
good,"On a typical day business was very steady and hectic at times without enough help. I learned there was not enough time in the day to get all the MTMs, IMZs and other forms and reports done that had to be done each day while trying to fill scripts and counsel patients and answer phone calls.The hardest part of the job was having to work with hostile employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing and speaking with customers who really appreciated what we did for them."
good,I work even it was good store to work at people where nice to work with the manger where nice to talk if you need anything that would help you with it
good,"This was an overnight position to which I am not a big fan, you usually worked any where from 8-10 hours a night and there was no overtime allowed. If you were to reach close to 40 by weeks end they would ask that you come in later for your shift which usually meant you left later the following morning."
good,I liked working there but i didnt like managers they way they treated people. wasn't a good enviroment to work in if you cant handle critism . Ita a great place to start off teaches you responsbility and how to earn your money.
good,I loved working for Walmart. It was a great place to advance and to learn many departments. I loved the idea of them cross training us so we could eventually advance to other areas.
good,"Its ok but if you want to move up . Do not  just move up because they need help   make sure they pay you the pay first, and give in writing that you are moving up. So they cant say go work here and we will move you up in a week because if they need help some where else and you go there they never put you back to the position they said you was going to get so you work all they work for nothing to make the store look good AND  you get nothing in return ."
good,When I started out for Walmart. I didn't have the slightest clue of what I was doing. The management just put me in the electronics department. I don't feel like I got the proper training I needed. I felt like they expected me to know what I was doing.
good,Some managers were ok some were not so ok. I did not like being required to work in other depts. half the day then having to work playing catch up to get my duties done in my dept.
good,Pay is low and hours can vary. Some employees are great while others just get by. Benefits will eat up most of the paycheck. Moral is low and suffers.
good,"- Réceptions de marchandises"
good,A typical day is about 10 hours with very little work life balance.  There seems to be no security and trust in the workplace. People with many years and experience let go.
good,"On the overnight shift, the job became more stressful as they implemented a time stamp where had X amount of to complete the task. It would lead to a high rate of employee burnout, resulting in firings, increased injuries, or employees resigning."
good,"A typical days was going to the back and start breaking down truck, I learned how to stock very well, hardest part was the managers, for holidays they had candies and food!"
good,"OK job to work."
good,"Eu gostava,era agradável  num ponto de vista era perto de casa,alguns pessoas eram ótimos  colegas é uma empresa  agradável"
good,"The salary was good for me and that I appreciate. HOWEVER....when I wanted to be trained for the front office (due to all my banking experience) I was put on the back burner! No time to train me (I could have trained them!)."
good,Wal-Mart has its opportunities but it really is what you make.  Great attitude is a requirement!  The better your attitude the better day you will have!
good,"You meet some geat, hardworking people, just dont trust the company personell to keep thier word, and they will try to find ways to keep from giving you a descent raise."
good,"It is a cool job sometimes, it is stressful also. the best part is going to lunch or laughing with a customer.It does need better management. Stay to yourself."
good,"A typical day included checking customers out at the register and helping them with their items. I learned the basics of how to run a cash register effectively. Management was not great. Most other associates were ok, some CSM's or CSS' were not pleasant to work with. The hardest part of the job was getting price checks or assistance in a timely fashion. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with pleasant customers and associates."
good,Wal-Mart was a really great place to work to learn skills needed for a better job. Basically its a stepping stone and many opportunities for advancement.
good,i liked working at Walmart because the employees were very nice but the management was not so there are pros and cons to this establishment so its up to you
good,Wal-Mart is no longer concerned about the customer or associates. The only concern is how much of a bonus the upper management can receive. Not a place I would recommend anyone to work.
good,I get to work unload truck inventory and stock. I've learned how department stores work. Management was cool just wasn't no backroom management really. Workplace was pretty cool nice working environment and peers. Hardest part was not besides unloading the truck having pacific jobs. Most enjoyable was the people
good,Overall it's a decent job if your in need of money. I cant say that for every walmart but for me personally i would'nt recommened it for anyone unless your in need for money
good,"Schedule was always changing, management was nice, Workplace culture was very diverse. The hardest part of the job was not having enough staff on front end."
good,Working the front end is difficult because you have to deal with customers who aren't pleasant when they don't get their way. Though once in a while you do get wonderful customers.
good,"I liked the people I worked with, but three of the managers just didn't like me.  they constantly judged my work as bad when I did the same thing as everyone else.  I never made Customer Service Manager but trained all of them in that position because the front end manager didn't like me."
good,Its a nice place to work at you meet new people everyday. Some good some bad but the experience is wonderful. The mangers are nice and your emplyees are great to work with.
good,Uma excelente empresa para trabalhar uma grande escola desenvolve o associado na vida pessoal e profissional.
good,"Job security threatened often,Unrealistic expectations, un predictable hours,but pay is great.Coworkers have to be competitive. Life/work is unsatisfactory."
good,Its easy to get a job. Management does not hold people accountable when they are slow. They make the fast people stick up for the lazy people. Mpst pf the people are alright to work with
good,Things could be better. Manegers expect crazy work goals with limited staff. Hours are horrible and you wont have a home life. But they do pay ten a hour.
good,"Unloading 53' containers was fun working with people you know that will put in the effort to get the job done in an efficient manner,"
good,Casi no hay comunicación y les falta más estabilidad
good,Best job to have full benefits after a year have to be a hard worker. Focus an ready to move fast an keep up management can be a pain but over all great job
good,Management acted like children. Hired anyone that applied. To many sloppy workers. Not enough training provided for new managers. Managers do not listen to employees.
good,i love Walmart and i loved my customers as well it was never a dull moment in the Walmart i use to work at. As long as you have good customer service then you wouldn't have to worry about yur customers giving you no attitudes or getting you out of character
good,"i loved working for the company it has good benefits , but bad management , it was fun while it lasted learned alot of stuff , providing excellent customer service  loved the customers not so much of the employeesand management"
good,Often times you may get stuck doing a job that is fit for multiple employees by yourself. Management is often times vey difficult to locate in a time of need.
good,I was with Walmart 13 years I loved it when I first started made a lot of friends while I was there I worked in several areas of the store but it took me 9 years to be promoted and I wouldn't have if I didn't go to the store manager and told him of my concerns
good,"you start in your work area and may get moved around as needed in other departments.  Then back to your department, to stock shelves, organize, make displays.  Provided fishing and hunting licenses (busy during start of both seasons).  Helping customers locate items even if its not in your area or finding out where of if we have that item.  Provide background checks for people who wish to buy guns.  Everyone helping each other, at times not having enough people for the job."
good,"The job wage was way under what I am worth."
good,At first it was fun then management started changing things and it just progressed to where you would dread coming to work. I'm just wanting to try something different .
good,"Most of my co-workers worked hard, we're efficient.  Not enough training, just threw people into positions and when they weren't productile, we're coached"
good,"Management didn't understand that you also have a personal life, made you do work that was meant for 3+ people because of how understaffed it was. Benefits are only offered after 6 months and not all benefits are offered until 1 year of empyolment."
good,Staff here was very friendly and took the time out to make sure that you understand what is going on. Always a please to deal with the customers that would come in.
good,"The management when I worked was really poorly hired. The store wasn't ran very well, but it was still a very good learning experience going from one department to another."
good,"Work used to be good, growing your knowledge everyday, but the management changed and with it came changes. Management isn't what it used to be. They pick and choose whoever they like and help them or promote them. The people that actually work hard get left behind."
good,"Personalmente fue un tiempo agradable, salvo algun que otro episodio con los clientes( inrespetuosos) ."
good,"As a whole, Wal-Mart is fairly standard when it comes to working as an hourly associate. Pay is average for an entry-level position, and advancement to an hourly supervision role is quite easy to accomplish if you demonstrate average competency. It is, however, a very competitive atmosphere within that tier, and you will be held responsible for many things beyond your control. Salaried Management tends to have very little training and, more often than not, a very unprofessional approach to workplace interaction. If you're simply looking for an easily obtained job, with an unchanging workload day to day, Wal-Mart is an acceptable place to begin."
good,"typical day was depended on what department i was in that day, learn how to cut deli meat and how to be a cashier, management for the most part was great and friendly, workplace culture wasnt always the best but it was never that bad either, hardest part of the job was cutting meat, easiest part of the job was cashiering."
good,"They need to learn how to treat their employers."
good,I learned every inch of the company and could never move up they keep you exactly where they want you if they can. People should be respected for their pay
good,"I believe we learn new things everyday regardless of how long we have been employed with a company.  I learned to be more efficient in my communication with my peers and customers.  The hardest part of my job was my management.  Favoritism was given to a selected few.  As a team we should have all been treated equally."
good,Mucha horas laborales reflejados en bajo sueldo. El cajero vendia harto para la poca comision
good,Job security is ok but your job position isn't! I took a medical leave do to a total lost in my life and when I returned back to work my position was taken from me after returning back  to work within my 12 weeks requirement.
good,"Working at Walmart was a great learning experience for me. Met some really awesome people, and management were really great! Definitely recommend to anyone looking for their first job"
good,Greet customers and retrieve their photos. Assist customers with  their orders and any self-serve equipment. Great customer service relations! Assisted customer service and electronics departments.
good,"My experience with working at Walmart was ok. Upper Management was very poor. lead bad examples, didn't care much about the employees.  The job itself was pretty cool."
good,A typical day at my job processig freight to all the walmart sores across the country the job can very stressfull at times it cause alot of heavy lifting you have to work in extrem heat at times
good,"The Walmart that I had worked at had very little empathy for it's workers, though the store ran efficiently with minimal shoplifting. "
good,"They started out great, but as I developed physical issues with the work and medical problems outside work, they would not work with me.  My immediate superiors were sympathetic to my needs, but I could not follow the attendance policy.  The upper management had some issues with consistency, some areas were lacking.  And now the company is suffering from new policies that have been implemented."
good,"Good place to work and learn new things."
good,"The positions available at Walmart are excellent for developing a social personality and molding of a thick skin, after dealing with various different personalities throughout each day."
good,It was nice while it lasted there was alot of thing that i ready did not like about the job. There were also things that they could work on. But the exerience was great.
good,"I must say working at wal-mart was cool overall. But I will say the pay is unbelievable in a bad way, I know it's not always about pay but I've always wondered how they expect people to survive off $300 checks every two weeks. The positive would be meeting all the different people and building experience!"
good,"A typical day would be to come into work and we do our group meetings, then i go to the floor and start down stocking the freight.While in down stocking customers needs help finding  items, to me the best part is helping the customers hearing the different stories and meeting a wide range of different people and cultures. The hardest part would be workin hard all night in a department and being teamed with workers that dont care about the company and dont put any effort. Causing the night to be chaos because if one person looks bad, we all look bad. For management part i really believe they have favorites and they dont really look after the hard working associates ."
good,"-stressful work enviroment where processes and policy are not followed. Management is impersonal, holding accountability for unobtainable expectations due to lack of payroll and short staffing. Hourly employees are dedicated and friendly willing to be flexible with scheduling to increase hours. Hardest part of the job was having consistency store wide with following ever changing processes. Best part of my employment was the skills I learned in Big Box settings, how to manage a larger personnel and the opportunity to meet knew people."
good,Loved working for Walmart. Grateful for the work experience that I obtained by working there. Always enjoyed helping customers and or fellow associates.
good,go in to push carts I would push carts up and get my morning checklist done then work on parking lot the supervisors are rude and management dose not like to do there job
good,It's a good job but I'm looking for more to broaden my knowledge and experience for work I leaned what I could there and now I think it's time for some change and for new job experience
good,It was an ok place to work.  They did make room for my work/home schedule and were very supportive and helpful.  I did not enjoy the work environment.
good,"ok but many bad experiences with management,other people was great working with unstable hours did not try to help employees just worked on dismissing people"
good,"Inicialmente comecei como caixa, completando um mês de empresa me passaram para Fiscal de Caixa. Jornada era boa, apesar dos dias estressantes. Eu fechava a loja com os demais colegas. Aprendi a ser mais responsável com meus compromissos e com com os colegas que necessitavam de mim e dos meus conhecimentos. O gerente pouco comparecia quando os clientes solicitavam sua presença para reclamações. O relacionamento com os colegas sempre foi excelente. Parte mais difícil era quando havia grande movimento na loja e havia somente eu/outro colega na frente de caixa. Parte agradável era no fechamento da loja."
good,"Walmart was the only place to give me a chance with me just graduating from school, everyone else told me I had no experience. I like working here but I'm ready to move up and do more. Its time for me to Gain more experience"
good,Walmart does not pay their employees enough for the job they are required to do. There are too many managers and not enough people to do the jobs that are required to keep the store stocked and running.
good,A day at walmart is great but sometimes can be too much at time. But I learn a lot of things about being in the retail The management at walmart is not so good and the hardest thing over at walmart is when there is a lot of call outs and you got to pick up the slack. The must fun is the employee you meet and the customers.
good,This company was OK. I had to deal with negative people; co-workers and customers. The benefits could be a lot better than it was. The management team could use some more training.
good,I did enjoy working for Walmart. Unfortunately though asking time off and never receiving it was a real issue back then. Unless you were in the right clique in your department you might as well have just said goodbye to any requested days off. Other than that I did enjoy being able to talk to different people throughout my shift as a cashier and learning some stories about them. Also learned many things also throughout the many interesting customers.
good,Walmart is a great company to start and a great work environment.Social gatherings are great. Numerous of potential growth and the work load or assignments are worth the pay
good,"Highly stressed due to poor management not knowing industry standards, .I've summed it up Management. Favoritism, Good old Boys Club, High turnover of Black Employees,"
good,I loved working with my associates and customers. I believe higher management needed to be more involved. A typical work day for me started with positive moral. We planned out the whole night/ day and worked hard till the clock ran out to accomplish everything we set out to do.
good,i have recently discovered that everyone is in my dept makes atleast .50 more than me per hour even though i worked my butt off and have been there for 2 years and the newest employees have only been there less than 6 months.
good,ok place to work for some exrta money as a prt time job and if you love meeting and talking to people assiting the older people which i really enjoyed doing..
good,I can't speak for other people so I don't have much to say. I really like the management style. The freedom I'm given means everything to me and I feel it makes me better at my job.
good,Not too hard work for minimal pay. Not a job that is hard to get but also not very rewarding. As a supervisor you deal with a lot of stress that in my opinion is not worth the money
good,"Only given 12 to 20 hours a week, even though most of the time they did not have enough employees on the floor to do the required work.  Supervisors were nice though."
good,"unload trucks,operate register,customer service. most of management were easy to work with on a daily basis as well as scheduling. learned alot about  a bigger volume store and its operations."
good,"Walmart is a huge company, they hire good people and promote a great working environment. It is easy to communicate with the managers. However most of the times there is a lot of pressure on the shift mangers, which they tend to transfer on associates. This makes the work somehow hard at times. One thing I have noticed to is that Associates usually don't last there they quit."
good,Working with Wal Mart was a very demanding and came with many challenges and multiple supervisors.  Challenges included not impeding customers and managers while store was open during remodeling and construction projects.
good,Walmart is a company that is out to make money.  They say they care about their employees but they really don't.  One good thing about working there is I got to meet great and wonderful people.
good,"Unlike being a cashier at places like dollar general you only have to do cashier only. Its easy but other workers dont work and have horrible work ethic, managers dont pick up on this and appreciate people that dont work and bashing other people instead of thanking the hard workers. I was told they were letting go of me after seasonal after they promised i would be kept after seasonal and told me it was safe to quit my other job"
good,Management was bad and hours were okay until they changed. The distict manager was not good and retail was not my ideal setting for a career in pharmacy.
good,"It is challenging work environment with long work hours. it has  great compensation packages, including annual bonuses.  self motivated training programs."
good,"Worked for them 20 years , had my up and down days but overall it was a good place to work for, customers come first environment, it's like working as a family unit . They are community involved"
good,Working at Walmart helped me with my customer service skills. Other than that I do not enjoy working at Walmart. There management is horrible and it's hard to move up in the company unless you have a close relationship to the managers.
good,"Overall I enjoyed my job there mainly because i worked in an area that I enjoyed. Luckily the crew I worked with also was a pleasure to get along with, which at times is hard to find. My main complaint would be with upper management. I experienced an assistant manager that slacked on their responsibilities and then before they got in trouble found scapegoats in those that were employed below them; which was sad to see some good people fall victim to this."
good,Your experience at Walmart will be directly affected by the quality of the manager in your department. You will be pulled from one department to cover another on a regular basis.
good,"Wil always miss all the great people I met working at Walmart. It has been over 6 years since I have worked there and I still keep in contact with the managers and staff. A real pleasure. The only truly bad thing I have to say about my time at WM would have to be that I worked my tail off, working overtime, going above and beyond to ensure that my backroom was the best functioning backroom a store manager could ask for and there was never any compensation for said hard work. I would set up meetings with managers in regards to my advancement within the company but to no avail. They wanted to keep me where I was and I wanted to expand with the company. Essentially that is what led to my leaving of the company. Overall, WM has a great atmosphere and wonderful relationships can be made there, but for me atleast it wasn't a place to grow."
good,I have been able to work with a handful of people that have taught me 99.9% of what I know. People that have been working with the company for a minimum of 15+ years.
good,Walmart depending on the location can be a bad place to work for. Management will overwork you with little to no help. Customer is always right even if they are wrong. Don't work here if you are not thick skinned.
good,"the duties expected of me were average manual labor. a lot of the managerial staff were very young which I found myself to be a hindrance to overall store productivity. the store inside and outside both had very poor security. my personal vehicle was broken into while it was parked in the designated employee area and neither my supervisor or the store manager were of any help to me as a new hire, then a week later my personal Wal-Mart provided employee locker was broken into and my keys to my house, car etc.. were stolen."
good,"Wal-Mart is a very productive place to work. There is always room to grow at Wal-Mart. Some of the managers could go through sympathy and empathy training. However, my manager is a good manager. Basically, just like any place, take the good with the bad."
good,If you're looking for a cashiering job I doubt you're going to find significant differences from one place to the next. Walmart did demonstrate a willingness to have its employees doing work out of their paygrade though and hesitated to officially advance this cheap labor.
good,"The pay is good, moving up isn't hard to do as long as your try hard. Co-workers are normally extremely friendly and supportive. Just certain managers do absolutely nothing but bring you down to the point where you no longer are confident with your work ethics."
good,"helping customers"
good,"Great people to work with and a great environment! They don't provide me with enough hours in the week to work, that would be the only downfall about this job."
good,"Great to be a part of a movement to go head to head with Amazon.  The energy is high and if you like fast paced and hard working with lots of smart people, this is the place to be.   It is a demanding environment and everyone has an opinion.   Highly political environment."
good,This company offer a fair opportunity for they're  employees to grow within the company when it come to management . This can be a great place to work for students in high school and college.
good,Overall great company to work for..fast paced..equal opportunities..transitional seasonal modulars was the most hectic part of my job..Most important and enjoyable part was customer service to the public and a sense of accomplishment daily plus the fact of working straight days and the heath benefits
good,"I worked evenings in the Deli slicing meat and cheese. There was also roasting of chickens, salad preparations, sandwich, and frying of foods. I enjoyed working at my own pace and when I needed to be quick - I was."
good,"Company was based on putting customers needs number one, the customer service is not as excelled as it should be and makes it somewhat distasteful to be a part of the team, not only as an employee but as an customer."
good,I  worked mostly 7-3:30  Five days a week.   Working under pressure to get everything done was really .Benefits were okay. Customer service I enjoyed the most
good,Liked my job but found out it's a very cut throat atmosphere a little too late.  Constant layoffs to hire entry level people at lower wages.
good,"Wal-Mart seemed like a good company with easy work, fair pay, understandable bosses, and a variety of kind and interesting employees. I found myself making new friends with the people with whom I worked."
good,"Aprende la atención al cliente, cobro de mercancía, manejo de efectivo y manejo de caja registradora."
good,"This job is decent and easy enough for a college student to balance. They're They're​ flexible with hours if you need time off, but don't give very many hours. They either give you too many hours to balance if you're on school or not enough hours."
good,"Un día típico en el trabajo es bajo presión. "
good,good place to work if you like working all the time. Too many managers so its hard to build a relationship with any one on the higher level.
good,Didn't know if we were secured with our jobs.I have had payroll issues. I feel that management could have been a lot better. They treated employees unfairly
good,"Walmart is a very productive work place. Walmart also have everything you need. You can find groceries, clothing, hygiene products, etc. You get 3 different breaks as well. Two of them will be for 15 minutes and the other one would be an hour long."
good,Great company to work for but management needs a little more attention when being hired. The company as a whole does a lot of great things for the community and charities.
good,Me dieron oportunidad de aprender y adquirir experiencia con el cliente
good,"Good first job. Good co-workers, management was OK. Some what easy job advancement depending on what area of advancement you were wanting. Good hours, good benefits. Easy work. Customers were awesome, nice and friendly."
good,"Sales representative, cashier, stocking, zoning, making sure things are in the right place, directing calls for management and departments, folding clothes, hanging clothes correctly cleaning the floor if necessary ."
good,"All i could say is that it was not entirely for me. Management is great, and everyone gets along, but I personally did not like the constant leaving your area and working in another. Like i say, it was not the job for me, but could be for some others."
good,They were very specific about every little thing. you must clock in right on time and out right on time. no care about the lines or anything. Very rude management as well.
good,"This was my fist job. The typical day at work included checking out customers and answering customer questions. Hard work but straightforward and decent pay. Two breaks and a lunch per every 9 hour shift. Good workplace culture for the most part, workplace drama is common. Management is friendly enough but greedy and dysfunctional. Hardest part of the job was the supervisors hovering, best part of the job was paycheck."
good,"walmart has changed over the years.FRom 2006 to 2010it was a great company, just a lot of stress. When returning in 2013, it had completely changed. They were more oriented on degrees over experience. I watched a lot of great managers get put out the door. Sad really"
good,Not much training and didn't feel like anyone wanted to be there. Didn't make near enough for the amount of work they expected out of us. No formal training process just had to ask questions along the way and hoped someone would answer.
good,"The environment at Walmart is very friendly, your coworkers are respectful and your management will do their best to make sure you're doing the things you need to do to advance. With my experience, Walmart as a company is reluctant to work with a college schedule. Walmart does not pay much care to the health of their employees in the aspect of calling in when needed. Doctor's notes do not matter in place of absences. You will be treated like you are expendable because you are. So as long as you maintain attendance and your location can/will work with college/school hours, Walmart is a good company to work as a starter job."
good,I worked for the company as a part-time cashier for a very long time. I keep coming back for part time seasonal positions during Christmas and found staff and management to be pleasant to work with.
good,No training because other managers worked there way up from hourly positions and they were not will to share knowledge.  Mentor program sucked mentor only wanted to know what time I wanted to go to lunch
good,"Working Walmart you have to have a good work ethic this is also your job security. If you do your part 100% without any lazy moments you make the next man job easier. When their job easy it's comes back to you. Once it starts getting easy doesn't mean you can slack. You still have to work hard it's your job security.Your work will speak for itself."
good,The job was to stock dry grocery products over night the most. At the job I learned how to operate a forklift and read the UPC codes to the product.
good,Work with retail management and interact with public. Enjoy helping customers with selections and other related issues.  Always something to do to keep busy for a hard worker
good,It has it is up and downs just like any job that deal with consumers and consumer services. Be ready for thing to change on a dime. You also need to be able too think fast when thing do chang rapidly
good,Working at walmart ia a fun and fulfilling place. there is never a boring moment working there. The staff are friendly and love working.  We love that there are opportunity to improve your skills and learn
good,seria mejor si te dejaran tomar tus propias decisiones por el departamento en el que estas trabajando y no te estuvieran molestando por cualquier cosa
good,"At the location i worked at they would hire only temps saying you have a chance to make it on as a part-time team member but out of the time i worked there i only seen one person from all positions get chosen to stay. Typical day was being everyone's biznitch which is what cap 2 means at Walmart. the management wasn't the worse but they are no where near the best. if you need a job this will do, but i wouldn't recommend it at all if you do get hired on just try to find another job quick. the only that made the job were my co-workers that's the only good thing i got from this job."
good,"Fast paced job.  Great opportunity to interact with people.  A typical shift was six hours with very little down time.  Lines were always busy.  Management stressed the need for good customer service, which I always provided.  The hardest part of the job was witnessing other cashiers working below standards."
good,"It wasn't hard, but it was hard. I did anything and everything I could do to advance in the store, but was never recognized. I was pretty much a CSM, but was never paid for it."
good,I enjoyed the knowledge I gained from managing the OTC products. This was a nice step in the door for future Pharmacy or health related positions.
good,"We would meet at the start of every shift on where we were going to be that. The problem is that way too often the labor hours did not match up with how many people we had. For instance I worked in the frozen food area, and the labor hours were often above the hours that I could work. And the hours were often 12 hours or better. And that does not include having to go out to push carts, or help with a meat & and produce truck, or the zone that had to be done before leaving. To compound the problem, management would ignore my pleas for help, and send them to the general merchandise side, rather than make sure all of consumables were ran."
good,Always moving around to different areas of the store. The most enjoyable part is some of the associates. Hardest part of job as salary is excessive hours.
good,"great working environment.  a typical day get very busy, stressful at times, but working with the co-workers really gets you through the day. management is very strict."
good,"Underpaid and overworked for the type of job that is asked, plus, more. Multi-tasking jobs other than your own and cleaning up after other shift's garbage. However, customers are great. Staff can be a little bit more friendly with less favourtism."
good,our customer service at the store is what keeps business running. our store is brand new (3 years strong) and we are still fighting some kinks but we are managing. keeping a positive vibe throughout the store is key.
good,"Troca de gerente e diretores frequentes; mudanças em layout devido a diferentes opiniões dependendo da hierarquia, fazendo com que mudanças sejam frequentes e elevando a uma alta carga horária perdida em um mesmo trabalho. Renumeração baixa devido ao estresse . Premiação mensais na tentativa de estimular os funcionários."
good,Treats employees unfairly and has very poor management. disorganized with no team work or efforts to improve attitudes in management and staff. hard work with little pay.
good,"Outside of a handful of managers, working at Walmart had been a predictable, overbearing experience and felt very underpaid on more than one occasion."
good,"Gives good entry level experience to people joining the workforce"
good,"I enjoyed my experience at WALMART because it taught me what I desire in a work place involving the conduct of the managers that represent the company that I work for.  My fellow co-workers were all nice and helpful, cannot say the same for the management team. They were never willing to stop and help, or willing to take the time to explain something.  Walmart is a good company to work for but the management team at that particular location was not up to par."
good,I've learned a good amount of things with the time that I have worked for Walmart and have made many connections with people who I consider lifelong friends.
good,"A typical day at work for Wal-Mart consisted of helping customers find product or similar items, restocking shelves and keeping area clean. The employees were easy to work with and very friendly."
good,Wal-mart is a good job for teenagers and people that are in between jobs. You never get your hours and if you do it is a few and far between thing. Customers are awful to deal with.
good,Nice place to work. Generous management. Friendly coworkers. Clean environment. Easy hours. Busy. Fast paced. Days went by quickly especially around holidays
good,"management and employees don't always speak with each other, makes for a stressful work day. not always enough information filters down thru the ranks, makes room for mistakes."
good,"Typical work days.  Days had its pros and cons  hardest part of the job was the lifting and overall work in the back room. Most days were fun and good days outweighed the bad. WalMart is really a great place to work. All of the Managers, and CO Managers were awesome, and caring people."
good,I worked with Walmart for a long time.  It became too much of my life and I needed to be with my kids.  They expect more work from less associates.
good,"The managers will tell you about ""policies,"" but will never be able to tell you what purpose these ""policies"" are supposed to serve. Managers usually have personal favorites, and if you want promotions then you MUST be on their good side otherwise you will never move up."
good,"Fast paced environment with up to 200 prescriptions per day, stressful due to not enough staffing/scheduling issues,  not enough open communication - events/situations to be discussed or explained properly."
good,"Walmart is a decent place to work at, especially if you are just starting out in life. Some stores are great and others aren't so much. The one I worked at the co workers were wonderful but management had a lot of growing up to do."
good,I learned to stock the produce floor.  Management wasn't very helpful. The hardest part of the job was stocking the floor and putting everything where it should be.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and working as a team.
good,"Walmart was a good place for my first job."
good,If work and life balance are a priority for you this is not the place to obtain it. The region I worked in was behind with the system and Walmart process.
good,The job wad great...the management was not so good.the hours were bad.. Poor staffing and scheduling... You will need a second job to survive.. All and all its not for everyone
good,"They take the extension of time make you are as trained as possible (trained from a computer) before you move on to the floor and begin on your own. They fail however to tell you about the policies, as a new comer to retail wouldn't know ."
good,A typical day at work consisted of a task that was given and it needed to be done by the end of the day. I learned how different retail is from the rest of the work force. Management changed so often that you barely knew one before the next moved in. The hardest part of the job was never being in the same place. The most enjoyable part was dealing with the customers and fellow employees.
good,I want career growth and I am not sure about any growth in Walmart...and Walmart is not paying good....but i have learned at lot at my work.
good,"The biggest problem with working for a corporation as large as this, is the individual contributions can get lost in the shuffle. Advancement opportunities are there, but largely depend on who you know rather than what you know. But each store is different and the right management team can completely change the experience."
good,"In my time working for walmart, I had a lot of complaints due to poor management and hateful coworkers. The pay was good for starting job, but this had been my 3rd or 4th."
good,"Some Wal-Marts have great management that communicate and work together as a team. Others, not so much. Management may undermine one another due to spite. Makes for a miserable workplace."
good,"I had a very pleasant experience with walmart but I would have to say there were a few members of management that would not aid in my job, leaving me to overall fend for myself. I feel it was simply my store and not all walmart's in general."
good,"Training needs improvement and management needs better people skills. Walmart has implemented new training, but still relies on computer based learning. Some need on the job training."
good,"Management is unorganized they never treat employee right , every time the pay goes up they cut your hours and youll never get your bonus"
good,Decent job with okay pay. Don't enjoy management. You show up to work have 5 minute team meeting then rushed onto the phones where you are suppose to take calls meeting certain company standards.
good,"Walmart is a good job, however if you lose focus as to what your main focus is you will get lost and possibly lose your job. you really have to know how to be tight lipped and walk away."
good,"I was a shoe manager when I finished with walmart"
good,I enjoyed working for wal mart. There was a lot of perks working there. I enjoyed working as a cashier blah blkah blah dbladhjhgt
good,"Walmart has a unique culture compared to most of corporate America. It is very conservative and cost-conscious.  As the world's largest company, once inside, there is tremendous opportunity to learn all aspects of the business."
good,Working at Walmart was a very intense place to work. The experience was horrible. Management lacked professionalism. The workplace culture lacked cohesiveness and proper training. The hardest part of the job is having to learn one on one when dealing with resolution. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting the customers.
good,Was great to work  there but management could of worked with there associates  better. Otherwise I learned a lot that has helped me better my work ethic and myself
good,"I had my good and bad days working in the Bakery at Walmart. Some days it was relaxed and fun and then there were days where I would be making 600 pepperoni rolls. I didnt like doing one thing my entire shift. They, also, left me alone when I was new  I had to take care of customers. The woman there were either nice or mean."
good,"Before I shifted to cap team 2, I was Hired as cap team 1. I left this position solely because of the hours we worked early morning but the start time seemed to shift every 2 weeks alternating anywhere from 3am to 6am. I needed more stability."
good,Was very bad experience i did several departments a night and they wanted more overall employee treatment by corporate is bad
good,"Not a bad job for someone looking for their first job out of highschool. Somewhat flexible with school schedules and days needed off or short shifts. But sometimes they ""lose"" time off requests or don't follow set availability for anyone. Depending on the store, it's a decent environment. Fellow workers dislike being there so they take it out on you, they also like to reward and advance the people that don't do anything. They also tend to overlook major things like short staff, until a customer complains about someone and that person gets in trouble for nothing. Very biased company that just cares about padding their pockets."
good,I like the people who I worked with. Some are just not the best people. Management was ok and some would not work with you at all. Are not friendly to school hours.
good,Overall a good learning experience. As with everywhere there are a few challenging people to work with.  Most were nice to work with. I enjoyed my interaction with my co workers and my customers and enjoyed sharing a joke and a smile with them as well as taking care of them.
good,"es ordinario, no existe compañerismo y la empresa se preocupa solo por no perder mercancia, no muestra empatia por el cliente mucho menos por el empleado; no se puede comprar a gusto porque el personal de vigilancia moniotrea tanto a clientes como a empleados, todo el tiempo"
good,It was a good experience working for Walmart. All the associates were a joy to work with. Management could be at times difficult to talk to or find when needed.
good,The most enjoyable part of the day was being able to meet different customers from around the world that would stop in the store. And the breaks were good but I rarely got my break on time
good,"Working at Walmart was so much fun & the associates that I've worked with are so nice & we work together & the management"
good,"when i worked at Walmart I did so much things the management were suppose to do, but they didn't want to. I worked 6 days a week 9 hour shifts with an hour lunch. the management just sat in the back talking while the sales floor staff got bombarded with tasks that the management was suppose to be helping us with and when we didn't finish on time they would get mad at us because they were going to get in trouble. When i put in my school availability they denied it and then when i requested time off for a wedding i was in they denied it so i quit. "
good,It's a good starting job whether you want to grow with the company or have money while getting your education for your future job
good,"Job can be cool if your stores management is cool, but if not job can be stressful without good reasoning. The job itself is cool being in produce and all, I like being around the fruits and vegetables all day. The atmosphere itself will be dictated on the people that you work around."
good,"The management is terrible"
good,They didn't do enough training for the different products we sold.  It would have helped to sell more products with more training on the different products.
good,"It was a good paying job with great benefits, but the customer service and the management there is horrible. The management and customer service treat the customers horrible. They could definitely use some improvements."
good,"poorly managed. people were rude sometimes, had a lot of favorites. didn't equally distribute work hours. i learned stocking and cashiering, customer service."
good,You work long hours and you really do not have time for anything else in your life. They mean well but you cannot really develop unless someone care enough to take that time and that does not usually happen.
good,People are really cool there and the pay is good as well. Management suck they don't care for the individual so if you care about that this is not the place for you.
good,"was responsable for ordering,stocking, resets,price changes, and customers. Learned how to read planograms and do resets in several diffrrent parts of store. Too many mgrs telling you what to do and trying to get them all done was the hardwet part of job best part was fellow associates"
good,"Advancement opportunities, great at developing skills, great place to learn a skill and grow your resume, or grow with the company."
good,It was overall a good experience to work there but due to circumstances out of my control I needed to quit. If I didn't need to quit I would still be employed there.
good,"I love all the challenges that came with being a cashier at Walmart, interacting with customers is always a pleasure. sometimes I really didn't get the help I needed when I needed it but, I still manage to complete my job."
good,"I loved the people I worked with, but management was a joke. They play favorites and are not accommodating to the needs of their employees. I needed to use the restroom to change my tampon, they did not allow me this break, i then bled through to my slacks. So I went and changed into my jeans that I had available in my vehicle and they fired me for not having proper attire."
good,The work was not difficult but hard work was not noticed they didnt treat their employees like they should have hours varied it was never a set schedule always changing never even on the same shift
good,Walmart hardly ever hires full-time employees and keeps the part-time employees working just below the full-time threshold so they don't have to provide them with benefits.  I learned that hard work doesn't always put you ahead on the job.  The best part of the job was clocking out every day.
good,You work at walmart and you expect what you get basically. They thrive by not overpaying their employees and it shows. Still a decent job though.
good,"A typical work day id tiresome, I be there in the early morning sometimes the only cashier til 10 A.M. I have learned to communicate and motivate myself. I do this by making my customers happy and make sure they comfortable with me as their cashier. The hardest part of my job is on self checkout people come through stealing although I catch some I can't catch them all."
good,i liked walmart specially the night shift the people made it easy to get work done time usually flied by to i wouldnt mind workin there again
good,Walmart can be a good place to work if you like people interaction. Their pay ratings are bull. With the amount of money walmart makes you would think they would pay their employees better
good,"The job is good as in it routine so you can get to know it well. It is not physically demanding, but you spend lots of time on your feet. There is minimal opportunity for advancement. Senior staff tend not socialize with the workers during the shift nor outside of work hours."
good,I loved my position as an online fullfilment associate. I wood refer Walmart to anyone looking to start a career. They really care about their employees and their future.
good,"As the technology associate, my job is to ensure that all registers are fully functioning. "
good,"Muchas veces no es congruente con su política y con lo q realmente se vive día a día en la empresa, dando solo oportunidad de crecimiento solo a aquellos q son del agrado del jefe directo."
good,Los supervisores muy predispuestos a colaborar y enseñar. Mucho compañerismo
good,"I would recommend this job if your in a bind.  The work environment can sometimes be harsh.  For the most part the other employees were friendly, but management was often near sighted."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo para laborar bajo presión, aprendí a tener buena comunicación y trato con los proveedores, los compañeros son de excelente calidad de personas. Lo más dificíl lograr una promoción. Lo que no me gustó es que algunos superiores no son buenos líderez."
good,It was a good place to work. Got to meet a lot off good customer and good friends and got to work in different department. ............................................
good,Meeting a variety of people. Learning new skills and ideas that I can carry forward into my new life journey. I will carry Walmart's basic beliefs: Respect for the individual and Strive for Excellence. These qualities will help me in my everyday journey of life.
good,A typical day at work would always be short handed and busy. Learned every aspect of being a optician including intense training in optician along with being environmentally skilled according to the state and federal laws. Management for the store had no knowledge of the vision center and there operation so therefore we had no support or backup from store managers. The hardest part was assisting the doctors due to conflict in store and vision center policies and procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting and educating the patients of there wants and there needs.
good,ive seen first hand how little these big companys care about its work force. they took all the benificial programs away from the associates. the merit raise all the good stuff.
good,Csm is always down your throat making you do everything while they sit around and talk. Other than that it's an ok job to make a living...
good,"i enjoy working for walmart, friendly peoples and i like being able to interact with customers face to face. I love that you get an hour lunch. The only thing I would possibly improve is the pay rate."
good,not doing the job you were hired for was frustrating.  Management was not understanding of certain situations.  Whatever the management thought was the most important project to be done was done no matter what else needed to be done.  Love my co-workers and when able to be in the department I was hired for enjoyed it.  Working with customers was both exciting and frustrating.
good,very busy work place . management sucks . my coworkers were the best part of the job as well as my department manager . the hardest part is dealing with rude customers yelling in your face .
good,It was a okay place to work. the environment was pretty good most days but the management there was awful. and you didn't know from one week to the next how many hours you would get and if they would come in and give you a new job.
good,this is a good company to work for because its decent pay for a nice amount of work but the one problem that most associates have is the managers don't do enough work and can be very rude about a lot of things.
good,it was a temporary job I ended up staying because it took me a little longer to find what I was really looking for. I hated working there they had me pushing carts at midnight in the cold.
good,"Was the evening shift technician who processed and filled prescriptions from 5 pm to 9pm at closing. Was considered part time, but worked full 40 hours."
good,Need to pay employees a lot better. There is no job security. You feel like any day could be your last. Ive been thrre 17 years now.ive worked in every department in this store from the money center to a cashier to automotive.
good,A typical day was the same thing every day. You go in and do the same stuff over and over. Management would repeatedly tell you to get something done that was not possible and after explaining what was wrong with what happened they would tell you they would come up with a solution but the next day you would be asked to attempt the same thing again with no change.
good,"Can't say the same about every Walmart but the one in Drumhill was not a place for an employee to grow. Training was not well establish, Your rush to finish work on a timetable provided by computer, which was unrealistic to workload."
good,I was not happy with management and the environment. I wasn't treated as an equal. I was blamed for things I had no control of.
good,Typical work day was checking parts and  driving a forklift to put away inventory in a warehouse learning how to work as a team and complete all tasks in a safe and timely manner.
good,I would come in early in the morning to bake fresh product for the day. I would stock the sales floor and with my remaining time of the day I would decorate cakes. My coworkers were friendly and I had a reliable supervisor. The hardest part was getting up so early in the morning.
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart, but if I had to say, then I would say they could improve on their managerial skills. their ppl skills are subpar and can be Improved"
good,I was the only cashier in the electronics department so at times it got a bit carried away and was stressful at times trying to help so many people at once. The fact you meet so many different people might give you a uplifting joyful spirit but overall holidays were the worse
good,Walmart is a good environment to work if you want it to be long term and that is if you are wanting to work under staff. It really depends on the position that you apply for. Some areas are better than others
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart starts with walking in the door, proceeding to the time clock and admitting to yourself that you are officially there. Then the procedure begins with walking to the customer service desk and signing off slips for recently returned merchandise, verifying proper procedures and guidelines have been followed and that all is well, at the moment, for the customer service associate(s). Proceeding on, the Customer Service Supervisor podium needs reviewed and balanced to maintain cash flow in and out of the registers. A constant total must be maintained within the podium to produce needed small or large change when needed. Next steps involve reviewing staffing and break/lunch positions, reviewing if any one needs to be going anywhere other than remaining stationary at their register, if any additional help is needed from the sales floor to maintain decent customer to cashier ratios and keep customers steadily flowing through the checkout lines at an acceptable pace. This above all is the focus of the CSS position - always maintaining adequate opened registers to allow maximum efficiency of customer traffic and the HIGHEST level of customer service possible. To BE the best, the friendliest, fastest checkout in the market, that is your goal."
good,"Over worked management for the pay they receive, Forced to work overnight shift for a t least 6 months if you like it or not if you want to be promoted"
good,"At Walmart I was a cashier, I mostly worked at the cigarette counter. It took me a little while to learn were the different kinds of cigarette were place at. I did not meet all of my co-workers, but the ones that I did meet seem to nice. They most enjoyable part was all customers I got to meet."
good,Management didnt care about anyone but themselves. Did not like training people how to do their job correctly. I unloaded trucks. Stocked shelves. Also i assisted customers when needed
good,"It is a fast working environment and this job requires for you to be on your feet all day. You learn about the difference between Wal-Mart's policies verses the state's policies. The Customer Service Managers and fun to work with and they are willing to help you. Never be afraid to hold you ground and tell a customer ""no"" when it comes to following the rules and apologize for the inconvenience. I receive positive feedback from customers and they I like the friendly environment."
good,"My overall experience with Walmart was decent, but that is only because of the employees that worked there. The management really only cares for themselves and it is really difficult to be intelligent and not be a blind follower and move up in the company."
good,"A great place to work if you like to  deal with customers Management leaves a little to be desired, The rest of the staff is like family they care about you!"
good,It was a okay day but we was short handed i really didn't learn much they didn't have much respect the management was bad i did not like it there the co-workers was not good either the hardest prt of the job was not getting respect i really did not enjoy that job
good,i liked the job and was good at it pay was ok but the job cut backs were tough they started to not care about employees beifits were good but working with a skeleton crew
good,working at Walmart was enjoyable the management teem was great!! lot of work but lots of fun!!!. the only thing the was hard is work/life balance  that the reason why it didn't work for me at the end
good,"Wasn't a bad starter job, sometimes a little complicated to keep up but over all pretty good experience even as a seasonal associate."
good,In a lot of ways WalMart is a typical retail store  Kept busy with grocery stocking and fill in cashier   Easy to transfer from Fremont to Lincoln Store  Quit in 2013 at 62 to semi retire
good,"The crew I was assigned to to do the remodel was excellent, hats off to Adecco for getting the right people for the job. Wal-Mart associates were very cooperative and responsive, work was productive and fulfilling. The management did not work very closely with the Adecco crew however they were pleasant when they needed to involve themselves. the hardest part of the job was working around customers, but it was third shift so it wasn't too much of a challenge. the most enjoyable part of the job was completing tasks with the crew and realizing the completion of our work and how it improved the store."
good,"Donner un bon service à la clientèle. Le respect avec tous les employés, être à l'affût des vols à l'étalage."
good,"It's a pretty average place to work. Great for people starting out and looking for a first place to work. Don't stay for long though, look for better opportunities elsewhere."
good,"Always busy and understaffed, customer's are not friendly which makes employees feel very burnt out at the end of the day."
good,"The management is very horrible and store manage will not help on any problems. Don't go there at all "
good,Great overall business. They treat there employees well. They give there employees as much help they need to get there job done.
good,"me gusto trabajar aquí, para mi esto fue un desafío ya que tuve que aprender demasiado en muy poco tiempo como el sistema sap y trabajar con un jefe que no esta en la misma sucursal, ya que en una oficina de RRHH es indispensable que el jefe este siempre disponible por temas de firmas para contratos, desvinculaciones, anexos y otras aprobaciones."
good,"Pay was fair. Work was enjoyable. Too many supervisors, assistant supervisors, assistant managers for the same department."
good,"When I started working at Walmart, I was really early into a pregnancy and it was undetectable. A few months later, I had preterm labor issues and was told by my doctor to ask for reasonable accommodations to lessen the stress on my body or that I would have to leave my job. So I informed the manager and gave her the note at which time I was informed ""You know, when I hired you, you didn't LOOK pregnant..."" I was then informed that sitting in a chair while at a register wasn't something they could do for me, so they moved me to the fitting rooms so I could take it easy. I would get constantly bombarded and complained about because I wasn't running around all of the clothing areas organizing, which was not the description of my temporary position as necessary due to the medical issues. I was to sit and answer the phone. PERIOD. I spoke again with the manager and asked her if there was any way that someone could inform my coworkers that I was in a temporary position and what that meant for my job description at the time. My manager then said they would not do that and strongly suggested I resign my position. To which, I agreed as to not be fired."
good,Need to communicate between shifts on what is going on and needs to be done. Management needs to learn how to talk to associates
good,"It felt impossible to move up in the company, or even move to another position. Management was not on top of its game, and never tried to show improvement. Pathways (Online training) were required and many employees were not being allowed to complete them, and then getting coached for not doing them. The people I worked with were awesome and fully supportive, i got close to some managers and we still remain friends because they were understanding and were just awesome."
good,"the worst thing is doing other peoples jobs and being short handed."
good,My experience with Walmart wasn't great. I wouldn't work there again. The pay was alright for the job. The management was less than helpful when there was a great deal to be done.
good,Helping customers with insurance and prior authorizations on medications. Having them pay for the medications and looking for cheaper alternatives. Management is overwhelmed at times due to the lack of help in the form of retention of reliable techs. The hardest part of the job is seeing people who need the medications but can't afford it even its only a dollar. The best part of my day is helping people with there questions and leading them to ways to lower the medical costs.
good,Overall it's a good place to work. It states in the hand book that if your 15 minute paid break is interrupted by a customer that your allowed to restart it. I was terminated for helping a customer on my break. And to make it even worse it was a really nasty day out that day and they kept me all day and asked to push in carts in super wet slushy snow and then called me into the office and terminated me.
good,"Team work is important to make safety. Fast paste"
good,Too many issues there don't take care of workers if injuried they wanted you back to work before healed. Don't like to give days off for nessasary appointments
good,I did enjoy working for them when I first started then after being there for 13 yrs and doing my job and working for them I found out that some management and I did not get along so I was let go from there and very seldom go into the store now
good,Company did not pay raises. bonuses were stolen by Store Manager. Had 3 different Store Managers during my time with the company. Management could be very unorganized and unprofessional at times.
good,"I worked for WalMart in Bellevue, Washington only to be disappointed that all the rumors I heard about WalMart were true.  They do not treat their employees with respect.  In fact, they treated them as if they were robots with no feeliings at all.  I would not recommend anyone to work for WalMart.  There is a good reason why there is no Union at WalMart.  The reason is that they do not want you to have a voice in your job.  Everyone should have a voice in what they do.  WalMart wants to make money at the expense of your health, private life and family.  I have worked at temporary jobs that cared more about you as a person and human being."
good,It was good the managers pick there favorite the D>C center was so much better to work for and the pay was great I like it that every one had a percent that they had to pull so everyone had to do there job.
good,To start my day we would go in the back load up the computer to see if our truck had arrived yet if it hadn't we would find other work to do until it did. When the truck arrived we would start unloading I understand we are on a time limit to unload a truck bit to get into trouble for a truck not being unloaded at a certain time when the driver was late was a little uncalled for. I learned about time efficiency and how to work more as a team to get the job done in a quick and orderly fashion. Very seldom did we see management unless it was to see how long it was going to be before the truck was unloaded. The hardest part ofcthe job was being there til 1:30 to 2:00 am and no one appreciating the job and hard work we did. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and being in the back everyone basically left you alone unless we were short handed and truck wasn't getting unloaded fast enough.
good,"The job isn't hard, isn't fast-paced, it's just right for someone who likes to have a nice job with no rush. Although management could use a little work. You need zero experience for the job as well."
good,"Got great warehouse experience from them, Wal-mart taught me house to use pallet jacks, fork lift, as well as how to make bells and unload the trucks."
good,Working at Walmart was a good job while in school. Flexible hours and decent pay for the amount of work you would put in. Discount was nice and it provided a lot of jobs for the people in my small town.
good,"Good job to start with, depending on the store good chances of moving up in position. Earning more money and better benefits Walmart is all about the management they have at the store if it's bad the store will be a mess just like your hrs and everything that goes with that, on the contrary it will be a good experience"
good,Just overall not a great place to work. the environment is not one I feel like I am able to grow and progress in. The csm never are on the same page and management never seems to agree on what needs to be done.
good,was not  pleasant to work here. most the time you where given a task without really knowing what you need to help with. Mangers hard to locate when need. No one knowing where to get proper supplies for projects while working on the remodel. Safety was over looked a few times
good,go to work clock in and start slicing meat for customers in the deli. and then close the deli and clean every thing and go home at 11 pm. Team work was the key to success in this job.
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for , Great Benefits and Pay . it's just not organized. Walmart gets great business and great sales. Walmart gives great hours as well."
good,"Receive assigned aisle, stock items, break down cardboard, unload meat/produce truck, face items to shelf."
good,"depends on the day if it was good or bad or busy or slow"
good,"I worked in a friendly environment, I tried to keep a steady/quick pace with checking customer's out, I maintained a clean work station, my co-workers were friendly, some not so caring and I moved up in the industry pretty quick because I am a very hands on and quick learner. Once I got something down, it was never hard for me to forget the flow of things. Management was some what okay, some I didn't have a problem with and some of them acted like they cared about their employee's when they really didn't."
good,Extremely busy. Difficult to sell the Walmart Credit Card.  PArt time hours allowed flexibility but not enough to support a life style.  Lots of extra hours over the christmas season.  team work was missing.
good,"My background includes managing a receiving department at Wal-Mart Distribution center with 40+ associates, this includes receiving of freight within procedures. Managed associates performance by coaching them in areas of productivity and quality."
good,"A typical day at Walmart may be one of two things, hectic and draining, or smooth and occasionally fun. In no time, I grew to love my co-workers, much like a second family."
good,Management fails to recognize hard working individuals they are not committed to thier employees they do not work as a team your tasks are time by a computer not an individual
good,Working for Walmart is easy if you can multi task and can work well under pressure. Sure there are pros like advancement opportunities  but this rapid advancement causes many people in leadership positions to have a lack of knowledge and are over all unprofessional.
good,"On my training week, they would regularly leave me alone in the deli. I informed them it was my first job but this was ignored and I was responsible for several things I had no training on how to do. The stress and the feeling of incompetence the employer caused was horrifying."
good,management was pretty bad. good times though. would be a really fun job for a teenager. Benefits were average at best. I would not work there again.
good,They dont do fulltime. Other than that it is not too bad. The job was good until i needed more money. I dont think i would go back though.
good,"Not the best job but better than others"
good,fast safe but not so friendly. its a pretty good job overall but management is horrible. pay pretty good start off with $9.00
good,"So, I basically stocked shelves and cleaned up aisles and put stuff back where it's supposed to go. The work wasn't so bad, but the coworkers were awful. I was a temporary worker working for the season and other employees who are permanent will go out of their way to act like they are better than you and can tell what to do like you're stupid. Too many power hungry people here."
good,"It has been several years since I worked here. I was also working at the restaurant and going to college so I think it was just too stressful for me in the long run. I worked in the Toy department which during the holiday season was a major challenge in itself."
good,"Each day I would sell guns, fishing/hunting licenses, or other items to customers, stock shelves, and clean up after the day. My co-workers were very friendly and it was a happy work environment."
good,very demanding not enough management support. associates are good people but demands and stress make it hard to work there.
good,"I loved my job but sometimes you had little to no help. it was like they put it all on you, an you had to do some of their job too."
good,"Muy buen equipo "
good,I made a lot of friends  and met a lot of nice and kind customers. I would go back after my 6 months of eligibility is qualified
good,Working at Walmart is really a place to get your feet wet and to get an understanding of the retail experience. im just filling in stuff for the limit.
good,Walmart is a great start off job to get into a career.  You have to be willing to work hard.  You have to be able to deal with a diverse group   of people.
good,"At the time that I was employed at Walmart, organization in the department wasn't structured well. There were unexpected changes in management and infrequent feedback on performance."
good,"Friendly workplace that admires hard workers and teamwork are the greatest in my personal opinion. Everyone gets the job done, and are happy to work there."
good,the 10% off gm merchandise helps stretch the budget as well as the holiday bonus on food. Constantly short handed and being constantly expected to do the work of three people and yet stay healthy.
good,"Overall this walmart in crowley was not a good job experience for me, it felt to be a very hostile work environment on a daily basis. Most associates were great, with some not so great ones, overall moral and attitude towards the job of everyone there was one of dislike. Management was not up to par with what i would call a leader, most would talk to associates like dogs and children while others belittled their employees. It didn't happen to me personally but i definitely saw it happen on a day to day basis."
good,"It was a very tough job to carry more than 50 pounds of carts. Load and unload shipments, organized backroom spaces, and stocked shelves back and forth."
good,I gave 100% to my job. I worked with Walmart for almost four years then I was told by my doctor I had to find a different line of work because it was affecting my physical health. There was a lot of heavy lifting and bending which brought back a health issue that I received while pregnant with my youngest child.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers and management team.
good,"I started when I was 16, first job and I think it was a good experience. Learned a lot about customer service,"
good,"It taught me patience and how to deal with people. It was a good job and a well rounded work environment, but the hours and pay could have been better."
good,"I was a sales associate. I helped customers, I was a cashier, I stocked the shelves, I put in orders for oil changes and tires, had a good management team"
good,A typical day at work for me consisted in assisting customers with their needs. Making sure that supplies were available. It is very important to try to get along with all your co-workers to make the job as easy and productive as possible. My hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that did not have insurance and could not afford their medications. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smiles and appreciation of the customers that were happy to hear we saved them money on their prescriptions .
good,"There is truthfully caring employees and everyone's there to help each other, but management can have some change wither it is with customer service. Hardest part of the job is... retail, Walmart is open 24/7 364, so you can imagine the toll your family takes."
good,"a typical day at this job is ok just do your work and stay out the way. what ive learned from this job is never go on a break with another associate that works in the same department, my co workers are cool some of them who stay out of drama, the hardest part about this job is nothing hard about it and the most enjoyable part about this job is going home."
good,"this company is great if you are attending school and need a few bucks, not a lot of hours, pay is competitive with area,staff is knowledgeable of store operations,and policies,and very friendly."
good,I have had mixed feelings at Walmart it can be alright at times and it can be not that great at times also. There are certain positions that are really enjoyable and worth the effort and there are some that are not worth the stress and effort you deal with.
good,"Handled register and money and dealt with 100 plus customers a day. Worked in different areas through out the store. I have learned how to deal with tough situations, and work fast paced. The management was a little unkind at times. I get along with almost anyone though. I enjoyed the work itself. I like being busy."
good,"Walmart tries to do it right, but they have issues determining the best path between long and short term goals.  Then tend to manage by emergency, reacting instead of planning, and corporate doesn't allow them to put the people in place to have effective customer service.  The store is short-changing itself."
good,"During my time working at Walmart I experience some friendly coworkers but also came across some rather rude supervisors that were not on top of making sure their fellow coworkers are okay and slacking when cashiers are calling for help. Not only that, they talked down to everyone and never sent anyone on their breaks on time, they would have a habit of sending people on their breaks sometimes two hours late because they didn't organize the breaks properly according to when each cashier had started their shifts."
good,"cleaned bathrooms "
good,This job can be very stressful at time and dealing with some the customers can just add to the overall of the day to day struggle. Some of the tasks giving is almost impossible to complete while applying customer service.
good,the people were fun to work with. management would come and help the employees out when they needed help with something. training was better and felt like they cared more about employees
good,"dia de trabalho cansativo, mas bem produtivo"
good,Working for Wal-Mart is a fun way of building new skills for yourself. There are plenty of way to reach to the top with Wal-Mart as long as your a hard worker you will get where you want
good,It was  easy to get in the door but they kept changing my hours I was trying to study and had class. It's not fair that they can change schedule so much. I had to leave
good,"Great job to gain experience in different areas. There are many opportunities to move up in this company. However if you have closed availability, this is not the best place to work."
good,The one good thing about Wal-Mart is schedule flexibility but the management was a big downside as they showed little to no respect
good,Walmart has been an amazing work area i had so far. Great working environment management is awesome they will make sure everything is in place for everyone not just the customers but for everyone.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the associates you work with. Sometimes you get a good manager that has good people skills and actual leadership qualities. Usually though, you get a manager that doesn't care. Sometimes, managers of other areas want to come into your area and have you do something that slows down your other work and your main manager doesn't take this into consideration."
good,A typical day consists of personal issues on the job site. Lots of favortism but if you stay to yourself you will do fine. Money is decent and you will be paid on time biweekly
good,"Get assigned a register, set up for your shift. Learned how to operate a cash register and cash out purchases, bag groceries. The management will work with you, but they don't always acknowledge the good things you, do. Sometimes you have to worry about whether or not you could lose your job if you have to be absent, One of the most enjoyable part of the day is when you get nice customers and sometimes they thank you for the work you do. You sometimes don't get your breaks and lunches on time, and the pay is low, and sometimes you don't get hours depending on their need"
good,Walmart has helped me achieve excellent customer service skills as well as how to work in a fast paced environment.  It has helped me realize my potential in working with and caring for people.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the associates who work at the location in Centereach. Everyone is nice, respectful, and friendly. The hardest part of the job is not having set hours when you have open availability. They will ask you to work on your days off and even call you at home if they want you to work. Your responsibility is to decide if you want to work or not."
good,Everything was good starting out. With the shift in upper management things have gone south fast. We the employees are not treated fairly. The store management is bad no one likes to help.
good,the job was good just not enough hours. The coworkers  were friendly. The employees were friendly.  I learned more skills with warehouse operation. The job was not hard  and most of it was enjoyable. The work environment was educational and motivating.
good,People were rude and mean got let go for being pregnant but was said to have missed too many days! Needs better customer service and security precautions.
good,walmart is a giant company that doesnt pay its employees enough for the work they do they don't give you enough days sick and it only takes 4 days missed to be fired
good,"Assistant Manager at Walmart was a position that built strong Managerial skills. "
good,They reel you in making you believe that it's the best place to work but once you actually start then most of the time you're just thrown into situations which you may not know how to handle at all and expect you to do it.
good,"Very fast paced, fun environment. Not every store has a good management team. However, with a good management team, the job is easier, more dependable, less stressful, and fun at times. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment and helping customers."
good,Really enjoyed the ones I worked with. But the store really needs new managers. The store manager doesn't have a clue of what's going on. The others just make up there own ways of following the company policy.
good,exinten muchos trabas para hacer tu trabajo a veces ni si quieras cuentas con el equipo de trabajo adecuado
good,I worked here for 5 years. Its a rough place to work. As a salaried manager there is no quality of life due to the hetic work schedule and extra days you have to work. And the Thanksgiving holiday you have to work every year.
good,"There's a lot of favoritism, Managers don't listen of complains from employees.  Manager only give the hours when they need you other wise you are only a part timer.  Love the experience i had every day by helping customers.  Had a wonderful time with my coworker, always helping each other.  The only bad part here is that you can be qualified to step up in a position but if you are not friend or family of someone there you can expand in a professional way."
good,Was not a great place to work but it was a paycheck. Company does not support staff. No organized trainig. Lots of work with not a lot of help from others.
good,Good people in the company. But management in Walmart technology is filled with people who don't understand technology. Technology decisions are taken by people who know nothing about technology. They trust vendors more than their own employees.
good,A typical day at work at walmart is a very stressful day. Never any help. I honestly did learn a lot i do love to learn it also helped promote me. Management isn't very good there they don't take the job very seriously. The coworkers are pretty nice but there isn't many of them they don't keep up with hiring when they fire people. The hardest part of the job is being stressed out everyday because i dread having to work there anymore to me its turned into a terrible place to work for. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get good nice customers that you can keep happy.
good,"I love my job here in general but its all the unneccasary stuff we have to deal with that is what gives a rating of 3 stars overall. The area I am in is perfect for me,I'm knowledgeable in the products I sell. I feel as though management doesn't truly listen to our concerns, as me and my co workers in my department have been pleading to have proper coverage on closing shifts and nothing has been done about it. We have requested equipment that does not interfere with productivity but that also hasn't changed. Everyone who works part time or full time will agree we dont get paid enough to consider the job a career and I personally haven't seen oppurtunities to advance this job into a career. However aside all the negativity I love the people i work with and the work, sometimes tedious is great for someone looking for a part time/full time starter job."
good,"Co managers dump everything on you, there is little to no teamwork, Upper management doesn't replace associates when they are terminated they just dump more work on you"
good,Management should help out more and hours should be set. Benefits shouldn't be set so high. We should not be pentalized for working hard and our best at tasks that are almost impossible to complete in one shift.
good,The company is ok to work for had no problems till policy and management changed. The staff was accommodating with work schedule. Schedules were rotated to make work load even.
good,A typical day at work consisted of me working with customers consistently. I greeted customers with a smile and asked them about their day as I scanned their groceries.
good,it is what you make of it.the management will for the most time work with employees to accommodate the needs outside of work. employee one-one reviews are not frequent.its a pretty decent place to work.
good,The management there is very rude to their employees. They seem to only care about themselves and not the employees. You seem to not be able to go up in this store either.
good,Good place to work at people are friendly the problem is working there no one wants to put in work all very lazy and management does not do a thing about it.
good,This is a good place for just getting started. Your pay is going to be nothing special but it adds up especially when you're a young adult and it'll be a recognizable name on your resume. Just keep your head down and work hard.
good,I am trying to get off of working graveyard shift.  Wanting full time work but may be interested in part time as well.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with.
good,"buena organizacion para realizar labores , te dan oportunidad de ganar un poco mas mediante tiempo extras, el pago es seguro"
good,"Worked as a cashier for eight hours."
good,Good company to work for if trained and ran procedures properly had a lot of great workers and fellow assistant take on hardship and company didn't follow proper procedures
good,"Challenging but rewarding due to job security. Taught Human relations, time management, inventory management, vendor relations, community involvement, and civic pride."
good,"There are plenty of opportunities to advance, however the management I dealt with was not flexible with my school schedule and my exams."
good,"Its a job, will sometimes work around your schedule. have good and bad days. get along with co workers and the provides excellent customer service to customers."
good,"Work gets done, its a fun working place. Being a cashier is really fun. Management needs to stop and choose their employees, it should be all equal. AP needs to be on their toes and not slack."
good,"Fast paced environment.  You teach what you learn to the next wave.  The hardest part is training a manager that has been hired above you."
good,I had a good experience there. I would go back. But I rather a more local job. I would recommend this job to a single person. Not for people who have families.
good,"I am a dependable,  heard worker that get the job done.  I am told that I am a pleasure to work with, and always make my job fun one way or another. I challenge myself to get the job done faster and done right. I think I would be a great candidate for a challenging career. Thank you for your time, and reading my resume."
good,"Co-workers were a pleasure to work with and were very willing to help and educate others with on any aspect of the job. Customers were generally in good moods, and from my experience, the job did not require very much outside skill or education to master. Although, I found myself coming in a lot on my days off to cover shifts for call-ins and spent much of my time at work cleaning up after the associates who did not pull their weight. The general job culture offered leniency to many associates who did not have a very good work ethic, and did not have as much room for advancement as was promised. I really enjoyed all of the opportunities that were offered to me, and all of the advancement that I did receive. The hardest part of working at WAL-MART was dealing with the difficult or upset customers, especially when the store was busy. The management team at my store was not perfect, but did offer a very personal approach and had a generally very approachable demeanor. They would assist on the floor as necessary, and were very good at assigning tasks and working with associates to meet the needs of the customers."
good,"During my time at Wal-Mart I learned how to manage my time to complete assignments, how to work hard and also have a little fun. The Wal-Mart associates and management made it a great work environment."
good,Just do your best and don't be afraid to ask questions. There are so many associates and supervisor that are willing to go above and beyond to train you so you will be at your best and always improving. Some computer training requirements seem childish but I guess that's to be expected any where
good,when i arrive at work i would punch in go to the assignment kiosk log in my id information and password find out my assigned cash register if one does not pop up i would have to find a front end shift lead which most of the time lead to running around and searching the store for one i normally help customers in the process if needed.
good,"My overall view of Wal-Mart rate woud be okay, I've learned quite a few things that helped me with my management skills. I've gained more confidence in my cusromer serives skills also alot of other things I've learned more so from me peers than my management team. There are great opportunities with these company but my suggestion to anyone looking for employment with this company is to go in with a open mind and be willing to adjust to changes because they accure each day you walk through the doors."
good,Mon travail consistait à vider les camions de leurs marchandises et de les placer sur les tablettes du magasin.
good,"Loved the work I did, did not love lack of communication between management.One manager will give you one task then another will come by and tell you to stop doing that task . Resulting in wasted time and nothing getting done quickly."
good,Gain Canadian work experience had a great experience to work in pressure but not enough pay for survival and less working hours. Enjoyed my working time in store.
good,"Every day was a struggle, the customers were rude and we were always short staffed. Scanning anything from 800 to 2000 items every hour made your wrists ache - the first week was the worst in terms of pain. Overall the other workers were pleasant enough, however I still felt as if I was trying to fit in where I didn't belong - it made it hard to want to work there. "
good,An typical day at work in first clean  up my area from the work that wasn't finished for the overnight employees than I have to scan the floor to see what product we are out of. After Scanning the Floor I will go to back storage area to retrieve those item. Once I retrieve those Items I will stock them on to the sales floor.  As that has been complete I will then complete any necessary paperwork and finalize counts for the Pharmacy.
good,Working for Wal-Mart had it's ups and downs just like any other job. The best were the workers also brings you up. They did treat us from time to time with food. Also when working for them for longer than 3 months you got a 10% discount that really helped out.
good,Overall the job itself was basically up to you. I learned to deal with different people. Our management was really poor. We had good co workers and some bad co workers. The hnardest part of the job would be dealing with rude employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we worked together as a team and kept things professional.
good,"Unloading trucks was very physically demanding for a 110 lb ,18 year old girl. I exceeded well though, better than allot of my co-workers. Helped out with almost everything I could. I enjoyed giving customer service when on the sales floor to help any customers in need."
good,"Honest, it wasn't a bad job, but when you have bad management, nobody is going to want to stay long.  Like any retail job, the hours are killer.  It's nearly impossible to get time off when you need it, or to edit your hours to accommodate a family schedule.  Instead of helping you get the hours you can work, they just cut them.  Forced all employees to work Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve.  Performance reviews were more about how we matched up to certain numbers (determined by machines that couldn't make allowances for disruptions caused by technological failure or customer difficulties) rather than actual performance as an employee. There is a lot of opportunity for advancement though, if you want it."
good,typical work day is getting the things done a daily basis and helping customers find what they are looking for and/or answer any questions.
good,Managers yelling at employees in front of customers instead of taking them into the office. Very unlike business conduct. They need to be more respectful to employees.
good,Working at Wal-mart can be a fun experience if you know the job and are not afraid to work. It can also be stressful at times due to pressed time and limited resources occasionally.
good,too many work hours for salaried members of management. Corporate leaders only see $$$ not people.  Does not follow customer service policies. does not consider home life.
good,"Although I just started, It seems to be a great place to work. Though I believe on the floor training can be improved. Co-workers are willing to help with assistance when needed."
good,"working for wal-mart was a extremely fun experience, although most of management  neglected there jobs and the work would fall on the associate. on a typical day we spend 2 hours unloading and organizing boxes off the semi trailer, followed by 2 hours of stocking then pulling pallets to the sales floor. the hardest part of the job was the lack of effort from a majority of my co workers and a lack of effort from my leads to get the group moving faster. the job was very dead line oriented and needed people to try and keep up."
good,"Customer service and restocking shelves, working alone and as a team. Enjoy staying busy, keeping my area neat and clean.  Making sure customers are happy with there visit and get what they need.  If not, try and order it from another store."
good,not a horrible place to work as long as management doesn't try to make you do everything you weren't hired to do other than that its not to bad
good,"As a cashier, a typical day was standing for however long per shift, scanning items and meaningless chit-chat. If it wasn't too busy then the impulse buy items had to be straightened up and shelves dusted. Every now and then the cashiers would help straighten up the clothing racks that were close to our register. The management at my location wasn't bad, there was a good pyramid system but the higher ups would still go around and see how the employees were doing overall. There was friendly competition with scans per hour so it made it fun some. The hardest part was people trying to convince me that prices were lower than they actually were."
good,"Not much to say was pretty neutral about working there, some of the rules were a little overbearing but not full on irrational, management was super hit and miss. Advancement is kinda dangled to you like a carrot on a stick it feels, if the pay was better and the raises were better it'd be much more worth sticking around."
good,"Usually I collect carts throughout the shift. Help customers with heavy items and/or carry-outs. The people I work with help out each other when asked, usually."
good,"work hard and you can advance to different levels of the store, always have a opportunity to work in different areas of the store, just don't like the holiday hours."
good,"Young department supervision and affected the product we were able to supple to the customer. Early shifts that started at 6 a.m and ended at 2, Friday-Monday. Good concept of online grocery shopping and having it ready for customer upon their arrival. Friendly customer service  with good feed back. Enjoyable job other than the hours and the commute back and forth from Stouffville."
good,"As a student, retail was a flexible and enjoyable job. Engaging with the public, honing problem solving and negotiation skills, and having a personal relationship with the management team were all things that made the establishment a comfortable place. The company is currently undergoing a slow reorganization as it adjusts to changing times, and many of the changes are ostensibly to the benefit of the employees."
good,I only had the pleasure of working in the automotive department. I can only really comment on that department and I would say that it is challenging and a constantly changing environment .
good,Too much work and expected for the pay. Great if you are looking for something part time while going to school. company uses a low cost strategy and in order to maintain that they have to pay employees similarly
good,"Wal-mart is a great place to develop customer care skills while dealing with multiple people face to face on an hourly basis. They tend to offer promotions to those who are willing to give that little bit extra it takes to accomplish any task. "
good,My typical day was working with the management staff and vendors to make sure that everything was check in and was ready to go to the sales floor.  The hardest part of my job is making sure that everything was completed before I left for the day . The most enjoyable part of my day was seeing the customer satisfied when they were able to find what they were looking for.
good,"I start my day out by running all the the white carts. Next, I proceed to rotate all the meat on the wall and removing any out-of-date meat and preparing them for throwaways, and if there were any meat that had a little brown on them, then they were prepared to donation rather than throwing it away. Next, I would run meat from our bins and prepare them in the cooler. Which by the way is absolutely ludacris because the the printer and telxons that are provided for us are not suited to be in the cold. Now I have asked who came up with the idea and I have received two distinct answers: (1) Corporate came up with it and (2) our store manager came up with it. Either way, I find it distasteful about how we're supposed to go about doing this new idea. The rest of my day would consist of stocking frozen meat, seafood and fresh meat. I have proposed ideas to management about switching up the employee's schedule that way no one is stuck on one certain time. Management, as usual, ignored the idea(s) and continued on with their tasks. Employees have either been fired or quit and this leaves the remainder of the workers with a larger workload and management expects this work to be done in a given time. I work extremely hard every time I go into work, but the hardest part of the job is when I have an unimaginable long agenda and I am the only one having to complete everything by myself. I do not continuously ask for assistance, but when i do, my request is ignored and not taken into consideration. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interactions I have with my co-workers and customers."
good,Your day is never the same which makes it very exciting.  You have your base but things happen and every thing gets revamped.  It is fast with every one working side by side.
good,"Rules change daily and if you break one, you're coached. Also, you have a few chances over 9 months time to be late or call in."
good,"I liked the job   I stocked shelves, cleaned, and helped customers   But it was one of those to many bosses, I learned that I need to have more patients."
good,need to be more understanding of peoples lifestyle. Part time shouldn't always have to require student hours. Assistant mangers are terrible
good,"The hardest part for me is the amount of time spent on my feet, bending over picking clothing up off the floor.  "
good,"The location makes my position tough especially when Walmart has created so many rules that forces us to not act on theft alot of the time. After someone tried to hit me with their car because they wanted to steal some headphones, I have been pretty gone mentally."
good,"A typical day at Walmart, depending upon shift, was always busy.  I honed my Technician skills for which I am grateful, and enjoyed working with a few of my co-workers very much."
good,"Not much work life balance"
good,"This was my 1st job working here after referred from a friend also working at this job. Typical day is mostly busy shifts between day, evening, and overnight. After I applied, I was placed for overnight maintenance. The interview was awkward but I got accepted and had to sit through long hours of training in the personnel office via desktop computers. After that I started my job learning how to the backdoor environment and everything related to maintenance. I was able to sweep, clean spills, etc. They have health benefits but you have to work for a year just to get them and there's a deadline you must meet before it resets again to another year."
good,"Dealing with freight, stocking shelves, and helping customers."
good,My review is that working at Wal-Mart isn't as bad as you think. When you work there for awhile you make new friends. It's a good environment too work in. It depends on what position you get
good,"While the work can be a bit much sometimes it's not too difficult to get used to. The people working with me can most times be rude and gard to approach, making the work environment a bit stressful. But overall it's a job that is paying my bills so it's not the worst place to work."
good,"aprendí  el trabajo de cajero repocitor y sus secretos ."
good,"I loved working at Wal-mart because I loved the customers. However, they did not have the setup to where the customers were satisfied. Their biggest complaint being not enough cashiers and registers were opened during check out. The store wasn't clean as it should have been and management not being easily available when needed by customers. This made the job difficult because if the customer is not happy then the employee receives the backlash due to most issues can only be handled by management. As a cashier you can only do so much with an customer's issues because you have other customers waiting to be served in a timely manner."
good,This location has terrible management. Supervisors are allowed to harass you without anything being done about it. I would never go back there to work.
good,"working at walmart can be busy, fun day.  you meet a lot of people everyday you learned different things everyday.because your very busy at work giving customer service, doing sctocking, doing your paper works, doing price changes. you will not notice the time. the only hard part is when there is very disrespectful customers.  That make me sad. it gives a bad day or i can say stress in your day that makes u upset for the day.  inspite of that you still have to be positive for the day for me to do my job and enjoy the things im doing."
good,Highly physical with long days and a high turn over rate. Alot of people can't handle the physical aspects. There are alot of rules that are strictly enforced.
good,"un dia en el trabajo constaba de cuerdo a la area que la que te tocaba laborar. "
good,"Started out great but after only a few months, the managers started showing favoritism. Associates are lazy and so are most managers. They will abuse your hard work if you are ahead of your peers. Wants you to stay overtime but will make you cut your time."
good,"Do the work of four people, work is never good enough for management."
good,They expected such high scans per hour that it was almost impossible to reach them. If you didn't reach them you got written up. 1500 SPH that is a lot. Also having to wait on CSM help was horrible they could take up to 20 mins to get to your register to help you or the customer.
good,"There is a lof of good things I can say about Walmart."
good,"I am retired and only work here part time. Daily tasks require moving merchandise for display, customer service and general appearance of the area."
good,This company is difficult to work for they do not provide a secure environment for staff. I did like my boss but sometimes never available. I learned how to deal with angry customers and provide a positive outcome.
good,"The coworkers are nice, management not so much. "
good,"customer would come in and out, no problems are created when dealing with the customers. learned how to deal with customers, time management, and how to work well with others. standing for hours because management wasn't great was the hardest part of the job. with breaks and most enjoyable would be dealing with my nice customers and working with the employees."
good,"Great job and somewhat of nice co-workers, but horrible management. managers scare the employees that the employees can not even speak up about how they feel or if they have any questions"
good,"not a bad place to work if you don't have a family. the pay is low. people are very nice. but there are to many managers giving orders."
good,"La compañia cuenta con grandes oportunidades, hacen falta lideres que ayuden con estos ideales"
good,"I just feel as though there is an excessive amount of drama that shouldn't be allowed in a workplace. I have learned to keep a constant pace and a smile to become noticed and valued. The main part of my job that was enjoyable happened to be working with my wife, talking to the regular customers that I grew relationships with to become friends and a flexible schedule."
good,"Was wored to the bone and unallowed to transfer or change my shift. Was not given competitive wage as stated in they're summer."
good,"A normal day at work would consist of me using problem solving skills to get through the jobs. I would always walk out with some type of new and more efficient way to do the job. I wouldn't really see my managers unless for the morning briefing to keep everyone up to date. The hardest part of the job would be the experience with my co workers, a lot of them were not properly trained so it would make things harder for the rest of us. The most enjoyable part of working there was seeing the satisfied customer after the job is done."
good,I get there at 3 and first thing we do is unload a truck and drag all of it out to the sales floor and stock it. We go for lunch at 6 and get back at 7. From there we take stuff off the backroom shelves and take it to the floor and stock it.
good,They costumers were very rude and the manager wasn't the niceses either they picked favorites would have liked it much better if they would have moved me to a different spot in the store but they didn't
good,I like to work hard and focus on complete the duty. Shipping and Receiving are fun to me. I actually enjoy the job. Co-worker are okay  to hang out with but they sometime do things that they are not supposed to do.
good,"You have to work fast."
good,"Excellent type of work for a first or returning worker. Not much in the way of advancement. Training is minimal. Enjoy working with a vast majority of different people, dealing with people and helping to understand what is being done."
good,"Got to work around all kids of new people, did new things all the time. Was a lot of work, and a lot of walking. The people that worked there where nice."
good,You can always count on Walmart to have hours to work very rarely did they have to cut hours.  It is also the same kind of stuff to do every day.
good,"es un buen trabajo y cae en la categoría de los que mejor pagan a sus empleados, ademas de que cuentas con prestaciones de ley,"
good,Just what you would expect from Walmart day to day job.Down to earth co-workers most nice job is not bad but is not fun either.
good,A very fast paced work environment. Everything is on a timed schedule which I didn't like very much. Most of the co workers were very friendly but there was some that weren't very nice.
good,everyday would be the same thing. going in and out of the freezer to get the product and stocking it. i learned to recycle cardboard and plastic.
good,"The job is very simple, communication is terrible which is what makes it hard to work here. Looking for something with intelligent minds an a good environment."
good,"Wal-Mart is not necessarily a bad company to work for, but the management clearly has its favorites which I believe is not fair in the work place. I learned different skills for several different areas within the store, but you must go after what you want because it will not be offered to you The hardest part of the job was trying to stay above the water when you are not one of managements favorites because anything you say or do can and will be held against you."
good,"I worked for Walmart on and off 2 years. They were good at some locations honestly however, I never had a problem with the work until they became rude to their employees and showed no sympathy to us when we would get sick or family situations occurred. Certain managers were em-sympathetic to their workers when time of needing help to meet deadlines, were disrespectful, and was NOT family oriented at all. I liked working there as far as job wise and pay was decent but some managers make working there feel sometimes regrettable."
good,"I worked as a cashier. was probably the worst job i've worked. Customers are almost always rude. Management was not very helpful with situations, they did not tell me what to do when something went wrong, they expected me to know how to do it even when your brand new at the job."
good,Stocking shelves nightly. I've learned to drive fork lift and use palette lifter and pulling tool. I enjoy working with my co-workers. I don't feel like there is adequate pay for the amount of work that is required to be performed nightly. The is also not adequate staff which makes more work for the existing staff.
good,"The job at Walmart for Food associate is pretty straight forward you just keep the food section looking full, fronted and neat. Sometimes they will need you in other areas as well such as paper towels or bathroom, etc. but mostly just in food. The attitude towards customers is kind of poor and could be better. We don't check things for customers and we don't spend too much time making things look neat if we have other thins in the store to get done because the management doesn't really care."
good,"The people are nice some are lifers, but most leave by the year mark. The management is nice but there's not a lot of overnight staff so their spread thin."
good,"A typical day at walmart has lots of twists and turns, from all the different people you interact with from day to day. One thing you learn from working at Walmart is patients. But Ive learned how large company's order there merchandise which was interesting because it helps me do my job better by helping Walmart cut down on their shrink. Co-workers and managers are friendly depending on how there unique duties for the day effected them. The hardest part of my job is probably dealing with an irate customer, when I am having a bad day. The most enjoyable part of my job ironically is when a customer makes my job easier and thanks me for whatever assistance I lend them."
good,"Hay días de mucho trabajo, y a veces muchas oras laborales diarias (10 horas a veces). Gracias a todo ese esfuerzo y a la ayuda de la directora técnica aprendí a sacar a flote una farmacia casi fundida.Como comprar, cuando y a quien. Lo que mas me gusta de mi trabajo es la amistad que genere con mis colegas y subordinados. Buen clima laboral."
good,In Wal-Mart one hand doesn't know what the other hand is doing. The upper management should have not been hired to work in a bean factory land especially not in a Wal-Mart Supercenter.
good,"working at Walmarts is a typical day at work, I did my job as well as I could.  I learned that all people can't be satisfied, but most can.  My managers were ok, my co-workers were great to work with.  The hardest part of  the job was standing on my feet all day and the most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction."
good,"Walmart provided excellent, exacting training for the first week of work. The training focused on correct safety procedures including safe lifting techniques which greatly benefited my work as a produce stocker. Working this position quickly got me into great shape and I was able to sustain lifting heavy boxes (30+ lbs) all day."
good,"The hours of my job was great, tasks were acceptable. I learned to use a hand held mini computer. Enjoyed working with the public. For the most part the management was helpful. I had great co-workers. They were there to help me in anyway they could. The hardest part of my job was the constant lifting of product over 50 lbs. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers."
good,"I was a cashier and worked in the money center and customer service. Always came to work with a smile on my face and always acknowledged my customers. I learned that I was either the first or last person customers seen, and if you talk to them in a timely friendly manner they will leave happy. Even if their having a bad day its always good to make the customers smile and leave happy. At Walmart to me management favored others. Management was not fair to their employees like they should have been. The hardest part of the job was dealing with grumpy customers. Mostly if they didn't get their way at customer service. The coworkers were all okay. I didn't mind any of them and most of them were friendly and nice. The most enjoyable part is making customers happy and putting a smile on their face eve4n if they didn't want to."
good,"It was a nice place to work. The people were friendly at times. I experienced somebody trying to steal merchandise on me twice. I stocked shelves, ran cash register, and watered the plants outside. Also, blew off the patio where the plants were. At times management was slow with their help that you needed them for."
good,"Now ive been working with walmart for about a year and a half now and i must say it haven't been the greatest time of my life. Working there i'm able to see there's not much communication between managers with makes it very difficult for the stores associates at times ! but i must say working here ive learned how to make better decisions faster. Most of my coworkers are unhappy, such as me and dread coming going work ."
good,"Usually i would come to work and go straight to m department sometimes their would be a skid with stuff that you need to put out and if their isn't i would have to zone the department , clean and also cash out customer"
good,I would clock in around 10:00pm. Would got to a meeting with the rest of my crew get my assignment and start working. the company is a good compant. But I feel that some workers make the company look bad.
good,"a typical day would be checking out the costumers, sacking the groceries, and assisting all of those who need help. the hardest part of the job would be the long hours."
good,you spend a lot of your day doing the same tasks over and over and are not given very good directions on tasks so it ultimately leads to double work as you need to fix the mistakes you made.
good,management really sucks. move you around everywhere. unappreciative and expect you to do everything. but blame on you. and doee not help. timing everything you do and expect you to finish
good,"A normal day consist of clocking, in signing on to a computer system that only holds third shift accountable for the times given, dealing with way underestimated hours on tasks assigned and then management wanting it done even faster than the unrealistic times. Even when you finish the assigned task you get poorly treated. That's the negative. Some managers are good, some are bad just like anywhere but in my opinion the bad out weighs the good. I spent 13 almost 14 years at Walmart and I feel like I wasted 13 years of my life."
good,"it is working at Wal-Mart not good but could definitely be worse. okay pay, stable work, but not much room for advancement."
good,A typical day at work at Wal-Mart would be clock in at 2 pm and check in receiving to see if anything needed stocked. Zone for an hour. Go to receiving and help unload truck. But when they where short up front I would go up front and help cashier. I had Assistant Manager Steve tell me that the Customer Service Managers liked me up front Cashiering because they could trust me. Then it would slow down up front then I would go back to help unload the truck. When there was enough people to help unload the truck we would rotate our 15 minute breaks but if there wasn't enough people we would have to wait for our breaks until the truck was unloaded. Working at Wal-Mart i learned to use a telezon kind of hand held computer and bin merchandise with it. The co-workers that I worked with willing to work and it made the time go by faster. Sometimes it was hard to go back and forth up front to Cashier because we where really short handed at times. When we where short handed in receiving some of the assistant managers would help us unload the trucks.
good,Loved my coworkers very helpful but the managers well i wish they were more fair and even with the staff.
good,"The overal view in regards to Walmart as a work environment is that employees have become little more than numbers in the overal system, having lost the sence of family that it had when I first started with the company"
good,"Me permitio ampliar conocimentos en diferentes areas , desarrollar procesos y estar siempre en proyectos nuevos , y conocerlos e imlementarlos."
good,"Management do not treat their employees the way they should be treated. They are only fair half of the time. They need to get their employees more help, especially those who work as hard as they can for the company."
good,Loved my overnight bosses and workers. Hated the higher ups and crazy demands of what needed to be done in one night. Not to mention the horrible raises and how they rate it.
good,The management at Wal Mart was always disrespectful to their employees. Never acknowledged a job well done or acknowledged when an employee went above expectations.
good,Enjoyed working with the public. Helping customers. Standing for 8 hrs was hard but keeping buzy help me not to think about it. Like any other place the boss comes around yu had to look buzy even if it was cleaning what was cleaned already. But had to look buzy all the time.
good,"I loved my job working at Walmart. When I first started with the company, I was completely impressed with  Walmart "" respect for the individual""  Motto the way our associates communicated with our staff, was very impressive. This includes all management staff also ."
good,"My aim was credit cards. Every person, be it poor or rich, I must ask no matter what. Sometimes I pushed for it, but the pressure was intense as the walmart rewards mastercard wasn't competitive enough with other brands. Overall, I liked the job, but not the people that were hired there."
good,Walmart stressed me out.  I learned that there were definitely favorites within the company.  My coworkers were okay until someone made them mad.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers.
good,"Typical work day was usually 1-2 photoshoots, basic editing, and then sales. Most walk-ins were for passports photos (roughly 19-25 per day). "
good,Good Learning Experience but manager need to understand that they need to stop making the people that work hard already work even harder instead of letting the people that don't do anything go to work and get a free check.
good,Walmart has been my home for 16 years. I have come to a point in my life where I am searching for something new to broaden my horizons. I have great feelings of gratitude towards my coworkers and members of management. They all have taught me so much
good,Very poor company. Rude employees and customer and the pay is horrible no benefits unless your full time which they only allow to certain employees.
good,No big surprise here... it's Walmart. Managers come and go and usually the employees are just used as a temporary stepping stones on their path of attempted advancement.
good,"Walmart is a good job for if you just need a job. The management tends to be full of people who dont know how to treat their employees, and customers often ignore the fact that you are human to. Aside from that, the pay is really good for an entry level no-qualifications job, and the actual work is very easy"
good,"As i always say, if your going to work in retail then why not the largest retailer on the planet. As a place to work it provides good benefits like bonuses, paid vacation, paid sick and personal time (now as one combine time off), and free lunches at certain events which are held nearly every three months"
good,"Honestly walmart was a great way to assist customers especially in the electronics department. The downside was that management wasn't as efficient as possible focusing more on return carts rather than actually helping customers, which in turn can cause customers who aren't fully educated about purchases to be making more returned products."
good,"not a fan of management or how the buisness is run, hiring more people when not needed and not doing anything when more people are needed"
good,"I'll start by saying that working at Walmart isn't the worst place to start one's work experience; decent starting pay, good benefits, and an honestly great vacation system. However, Walmart is only worthwhile as a career if you can become a manager. If you are just an average associate, be prepared to have no say in how things are run, working hard for little to no recognition, and basically being stuck in one department for years at a time."
good,They have your schedule all over the place and can never keep enough people staffed on registers at all times. They don't accept accept doctors notes and will fire you if you don't follow a program that you arent allowed to use until you have been there for a year or longer
good,I found that what I was doing at wal mart fit me perfectly. I was full time then part time. Although a little drama on the job it seemed as though everyone just wanted to get the work done. It was good for where I was at for the time.
good,The co-workers and supervisors were fun and understanding to work with. We would all work together to make sure that the customer was taken care of all their needs.
good,"a typical day:unload trucks,stock frieght,pull out frieght, pick and bin,pallet truck, clean/maintenance"
good,A typical day consisted of conducting daily counts and organization of the backroom. Always stayed busy with work and days went by fast.
good,Not a bad place to be working. Only bad thing is the managers will play favorites with one or two people per shift. Management does help work product.
good,Days start by finding out what needs to be made and how much. After that the machines are running and products are checked. The end of the day is when the machine is cleaned.
good,"The job doesn't pay enough I rang up customer purchases, returned customer purchases, answered phones."
good,Working here was difficult. The supervisors would not follow work permit rules and regulations for students/minors.. There were never enough employees working at any given time.
good,"Working a Super Walmart was very hard work with low pay and no benefits for part-time not even sick time.  in my opinion, there were too many managers with good pay and good benefits for a single store.  They could cut some of those manager positions and pay the employees a little more."
good,"not much room for advancement in this company alot has changed over the last few yeras, low moral  from associates, head office needs to look into sales associates suggestions"
good,"I would I have to Rate Walmart as being Just an ok Work Environment. While Employed with this company i learned to keep to myself. The Energy in that Place was Total Chaos and drama, The management were very unprofessional, rude, and lacked leadership skills. My co-workers on the other hand where amazing, They worked fast and efficiently, and seemed consistently pleasant with other staff and customers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with lack of communication between staff and management. The co-workers you will work with are the best."
good,"A typical work day involved working the freight from the night before."
good,"Your typical day starts with a half hour meeting covering employee failings or hyped up propaganda. You next began pulling stock in preparation to stock shelves. Stocking shelves consumed most of the rest of your night, then rewrapping pallets and returning them to the stock area. Enjoyable, I'd have to say that last look down the isle when it's done. Hardest, managing time to get it all done ."
good,"unfortunately, Walmart has taken advantage of hiring part-time to avoid benefit packages, therefore all employees that have been hired at this new store are part-time, many working more than one job to earn a get by income."
good,"most of management hasn't any integrity"
good,It depends on which walmart you at i guess but I love the coworkers i work with management is horrible though but hardest part is when management be trying to get under your skin
good,"A typical day at Walmart ranges from great to terrible, depending on the freight, if we are under staffed and if it is a holiday weekend. I have learned so many things from working at Walmart, pretty much any type of skill that one could think of, its not just retail and putting things on shelves it is so much more. But I see Walmart as a job that is needed, but not a career. The management team varies, there is such a high turnaround with managers its hard to comment on the team. The hardest part of the job is doing the work of 3 people by yourself and the most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits, Walmart has great benefits for the most part."
good,Not being my first job i was able to learn about the work place and work more closely with people face to face.
good,I learned to work with different people and improve my customer service skills. The work load wasn't that bad because of the department I worked in. The best thing I liked about my job is that I don't stay pass eight  o clock. the management is not that good they don't communicate with each other to get the job done.
good,"My experience working with Walmart was hard work, but it helped me a lot with coworker cooperation and communication. I would definitely go back to working there, given the opportunity."
good,"Providing excellent customer service.  Cashier/Tender, I had the opportunity to meet great people in my community and engage them through building rapport. Coworkers always working as a team and encouraging problem solving skills.  Hardest part of the job would have been stocking. Most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to stay in contact with a great majority of my customers and their families beyond working for Walmart, my customers mean a lot to me and were the greatest blessing while employed through Walmart."
good,"my experince at walmart was probably different then what most will have. i started in the meat department thinking it was going to be a way to get my butchers licence. we did not cut meat. my department manager from day one had an issue with me and through the next 9 months battered me daily and even though i brought it up to his boss, their boss, nothing changed which ultimately lead to me quitting."
good,"A nivel empresa bastante bien, muy buen ambiente de trabajo, excelentes prestaciones, lo dificil aprenderse la mercancia, en gerencia deja mucho que desear."
good,"Not really my setting."
good,"Work 8 hour shift depending on your title and position. There's no overtime only when it's beneficial to the salary paid employees. Hardest part is that you never feel appreciated. They really believe this raised gave them the right to treat people rude, and that's not right"
good,"Un día típico en este trabajo implicaba rolar turnos, solo se contaba con un día de descanso a la semana, en ocaciones me solicitaban doblar turno. Principalmente tenia que mantener mi área de trabajo en orden y realizar el cobro de los artículos de la tienda. Cuando doblaba turno, apoyaba en actividades de otros departamentos."
good,"You will always have something to do no matter what position, but some are faster paced than others.  The direct management is nice, but the once you reach store manager, things change.  A lot of favoritism is played and almost no one is held accountable if they screw up over and over."
good,Trabaje muy a gusto y me promocionaron pronto ... fue un buen año.
good,"My typical day at work was really helping the workers in their personal and professional lives.  I interviewed and hired workers.  Held orientations for new hires.  Make sure the new hires were in the system to be paid in a timely manner.  Informed workers when they were available for benefits.  Help management  to maintain staffing levels for each department.  Help workers with LOA's, FMLA's and any time off paperwork.  The hardest part of my job was seeing how management treated the workers.  The most enjoyable part was meeting new people during the interviewing process."
good,great job to start off while living in high school or living with parents. great people there with knowledge of there stuff and they will take time some of the time to teach you.
good,It was an opportunity to learn and meet people on a daily basis.  It allowed my customer service skills to be reinforced daily.  Hands on experiences and lessons learned.
good,"When you first apply, it almost seems like the job will be good. Great benefits, decent hours, semi decent pay, and a decent crew. But once you start working there, you find out that your pay is garbage, the hours are inconsistent, the crew is not very welcoming to new people, there is little to no training for the job, and you don't get any of your benefits until after 3 months of working there. The worst part is the management. Many of them are inept at their jobs, and often forget they either allowed you time off, or authorizing paid overtime. All in all, it is not the most pleasant place to work. If you are looking for temporary work, then it is good. But long term, it won't work out."
good,Wal-mart is a constantly changing company but it is not changing for the better. Management at Wal-mart is lacking to the point that people that work in the lower parts of the company have voice to express concerns about their work experience and are then scrutinized about those same issues. The top tier managers also make changes to workload without updates. What i mean by that is the fact that they will add work to the work you are already accustomed to without giving an updated time to finish. In other words they want you to complete all the new work and old work in the same time as the old. Wal-mart is not a completely bad experience though. You learn very valuable trade skills that you will use for future jobs experiences. the other co-workers are also good reason to join Wal-mart's team because Wal-mart is infact a melting pot of different people of different backgrounds. I would say if wasn't for the lack of true management problem and constant changes Wal-mart would be a decent place to work.
good,It's not all that bad of a place to work but can start to be a handful. High pace environment with lots of customer service. full time hours and there is always plenty to be done.
good,Empresa onde funcionários competem entre si para ver quem é melhor e quem é o querido do chefe .
good,"Great people poor advancement:"
good,"It felt like one of those places you work just for work and nothing more. everyone in charge whenever they felt a certain way, it would get taken out on the other employees."
good,"I was a cashier at Walmart. My typical day of work would consist of checking out customers, greeting them and solving customers problems at the service desk.Training for the job was easy and well taught. Coworkers are friendly and very helpful. The hardest part of the job is the constant movement, twisting and dealing with rude customers. A typical workday was arriving at my station and signing on to the register. My first customer would arrive which I greeted. I continue to repeat this process until my first break. I would come back from break and repeat the same process over again. The job is so repetitive and gets old fast. The pay is unfair. I started as a cashier and THEY asked me to help out at the service desk. So I worked service desk and cashiering but only got paid for cashiering. I asked to get promoted but they wouldn't allow it because of my coachings. BUT i got the coachings AFTER I had already been working the desk as well. Just is unfair pay and wont allow you to upgrade your position easily."
good,People are great. Job is easy going and fast pace. Management is a little hatefully about a little of everything. Pay rate and benefits could be a lot better
good,"greeted people entering the store and handed out shopping carts to  them"
good,"I helped open the Myrtle Ridge Location. Moved from Cashier to Jewelry to Customer Service. I learned a lot about the money transfers being that our Customer Service and Money Center and Site-to-Store was all in one. Management was personable but busy a lot and changed a lot. My co-workers aside from the customers was the ""life"" of the workplace although they were often overworked, and overlooked. The hardest part of the job is not getting that feeling that all your hard work and dedication is appreciated and being worked in all aspects/areas without the pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, employee discounts, and bonuses."
good,"Working with a lot of people in my charge, I learn to be more comprehensive with each one. Trying to understand there point of view and why they act this way in some particular situation. "
good,"Typical day at work included making decisions on my own, quick and proficient decisions. I have learned a lot threw working at the front desk, my co workers were awesome, easy to get along with, of course everywhere has good and bad. I don't know what the hardest part of the job would be here. Most enjoyable part was meeting new people and seeing different faces"
good,The customers were awesome  management needs work I thin k there was too much favoritism towards some employees.Sometimes I felt management listened but did not really hear what I said
good,"On your feet a lot, a fast environment, you get to meet a lot of new people be them coworkers or customers. They have a McDonalds in the building which makes it easy to get lunch, there was also very long lines and not many people that work the registers."
good,Working at Walmart was an experience.  I would not work there again unless I absolutely had too.  Coworkers were enjoyable but the overall company was not for me.
good,"Agradável um ambiente bom não tenho reclamações, a empresa é de grande porte e capacitada para uma grande quantidade de funcionários, não  tenho nada a falar de colegas eram poucos, somente da equipe de loos, pois não podíamos ter outros funcionários como colegas por causa da função. (segurança)"
good,"soy una persona responsable."
good,"1. Need to cashier almost everyday and not enough time to work my department."
good,"A typical day would include down-stacking 4-7 pallets of merchandise either by yourself, or in a group of 2-3. Management was fair, however there hadn't been a lot of preping and training for the job. The overall most enjoyable part was the co -workers: all very kind and willing to help."
good,"Good place to work and meet new people. Poor benefits, but good 40 hours a week with no over time. Customers are high demanding. Management is helpful and overwhelmed. The best part is when you get out of work with friend and co-workers to dinner. The hardest part of the job is every first of the month getting super busy with customers. After years at work, some things change and you learn new things everyday."
good,A typical day at Walmart was spent helping customers in the fitting rooms. Answering the phones and communicating directly with management. Some of the management at Walmart was good others not so much. I loved my co-workers they were really easy to work with. Hardest part of the job was the physical aspect I am handicap and needed to be able to sit at times during the day. I was not able to do this do to some management disregarding my doctors instructions. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers.
good,"professional atmosphere that allowed you to move forward in a career if you chose too.It helped me to learn through their task system, to manage the job within a time frame given,to pace myself and to concentrate on the job at hand."
good,really wish that it could have been a better long lasting experience. this company name exceeds what you would expect as a customer . working in walmart was a decision of balance for me.
good,Management is always confused. So much gossip its like being back in high school. Almost set up to fail in a few situations. Such as Dept mgr wants me to do a project in the department then a Ast mgr comes and wants you do to something else pulling you off first project. You have to drop what the department manager wants then do what the Assistant manager wants. To come in the next day and get in trouble from a diff dpt mgr and assistant mgr for not finishing the dpt mgr project.
good,Working for Walmart is like working at almost any other grocery/supermarket conglomerate be punctual and do your job everyday and you will receive a paycheck come payday management could be contradictory at time most of the co workers were complacent  although a few were looking for bigger and better things
good,"Working at Walmart is easy, there isn't anything challenging about working here. The other associates are fun to work with and easy to get along with. Some members of the management team however, have issues communicating and working with their associates. The customers tend to be incredibly rude to the cashiers."
good,Writing in vehicle orders and checking on merchandise in inventory. Consistent routine daily. Hardest part of the job is poor management and inconsistent work schedule.
good,"my experience working for Walmart was not a bad one. my co-workers were very nice and the managers are polite. a typical day at work for me was stocking the freezers,organizing"
good,"A normal day was always hectic. I learned how to manage my time to get all of my work done on a daily basis, even if it meant having to delegat to my associates. My co-workers were fun and enjoyable to be around. The hardest part of my job was leaving. My most enjoyable moments were when I accomplished a goal I had set form myself."
good,The work was not hard. very easy and my boss was very easy going I just did not like some of the people I had to work with due to them not doing their job's correctly or at all.
good,"typical day is not stop and micro-managed. most of my experience is self learned, no training. management needs better communication. co-workers just need work but unsatisfied. the hardest part of the job was staying motivated. the most enjoyable part was the customers"
good,"Always busy with plenty of things to do. The best part of this job for me was assisting customers. "
good,"Horarios poco flexibles, presion en demasiía poco apoyo laboral , jornandas no respetadas, represalias laborales."
good,"A typical day a Walmart is to hit the ground running. Always a great deal to accomplish, which I enjoy because I am always looking to stay busy and better the company. Great company but when it comes to management, it is rather difficult to work 80 hours a week and maintain a reasonable home/work life balance."
good,"Management wasn't clear in communication of tasks. "
good,"Boa para trabalhar no setor de vendas, gerencia não é das melhores, horários não são os melhores."
good,I was sexually assaulted by a co worker and I reported it and got fired.he is still working there so be carful if hired there.
good,Hay buen hambiente de trabajo pero las oportunidades y el sueldo es bajo
good,"ótima empresa com muitos benefícios, com grandes oportunidades de crescimento."
good,"I enjoy working with the customers because I am a people person. Retail is a good job, but Walmart ask too much of you and don't want to pay you for what you qualify for. There is no moving up, just more work."
good,"In day i have to do stocking,picking,binning,audits and receiving,"
good,"Very busy place to work in which I love, but not enough hours given, the staff I worked with were awesome and I did love interacting with customers and providing excellent service. The days were filled with  a lot of people needing their prescriptions filled and I enjoyed how that made the day go by quick."
good,en esta empresa aprenda manejar dinero convivir abiertamente con mis compañeros y con los clientes.
good,"trabajo que deberia de ofrecer por lo menos algun tipo de salario o sueldo, ya que las personas que son empacadores, no cuentan con seguro y en los horarios de la tarde los niños y mayores de edad salen a las 10 de la noche y pueder algo riesgoso ya que no todos viven cerca de la empresa."
good,It is very nice to work with TCS employees . The TCS is building is good to work compare to Walmart ISD building. ISD is very conjugated place to work.
good,"Not a bad place to work, was much better for the first few years until our management changed.  Most people were friendly and willing to help each other out.  Used to have a lot of outside activities for employees until management decided we didn't need any at all."
good,"At this job they expected the most out of their employees. my usual schedule was either 5pm to 10pm or 8am to 5pm. There are many different mangers that work at Walmart, they all have different responsibilities and sometimes they can over direct you by telling you to do one assignment then another manger telling you differently, I would say that was the hardest part of the job. the most enjoyable part about this job was getting to know different people."
good,"Loved the people I worked with (other cashiers) & MOST of the customers that came in.  Did NOT like the schedule.  Management wouldn't work with me on my schedule at all & I have 3 kids."
good,"Great place to work while in school, my coworkers were always very nice and fun too be around. Very laid back work environment, I've always enjoyed helping customers find the things they were looking for even they weren't sure what they were looking for."
good,bakery duties. learned to haul freight and stock shelves. for most part coworkers very friendly the best part of working there was that each day was different
good,"Little opportunity for advancement. Do not recognize the hard work of dedicated employees. Too many managers."
good,Whenever associates needed something managment was always slow when it came to responding. questions were not answered on time.
good,"A typical day at work would be fast pace an challenging. Everyday I learn something new, which mainly comes from my interaction with the customers and the feedback they provide about the stores overall performance and what we could do better to provide A-one customer service. Management is difficult to sum up. I guess with any job you have managers that are team players and managers that are not. My co-workers, I would say the same, most are out for themselves. There really wasn't a hard part. I am capable of doing whatever duties that I am assigned. The most enjoyable part of the job would be seeing a smile on the customers face that I put there."
good,I love the work but the management was poor and seemed really careless of its employees and the people who really made the store run.
good,"At Walmart I was a sales associate so I helped customers, cashiered, stocked shelves, designed mods, and more little stuff. The management stepped on each others toes too much  and it was hard to get a clear message to the associates because they were all saying something different. It was a decent job though."
good,"dealing with customers and managing the associates through out the store, give money to register operators, deal with any problems that come up."
good,"A typical day here for me involves zoning both of my departments, getting instruction from the department managers, helping the customers, cutting fabric, restocking the shelves, help create new mods for new merchandise, operating a cash register when needed, etc."
good,management left something to be desired. there was a lot of favoritism showed toward some employees and scheduling was not based on time available.
good,J'ai appris beaucoup de chose en travaillant chez Walmart. La gestion du stress et la demande de la clientèle fait partie des choses que j'ai appris.
good,walmart is a great place to work if you have thick skin.... the people are great management sucks treats you like a number more then a person..... and always asking more from those that do the job and less from those that don't the hardest part of the job is leaving the stress there
good,The management were very difficult to work with. They seem to never highlight the great things the workers did but always addressed the issues or problems. Coworkers were very young minded and full of drama. I loved the fact that I was a stocker and was able to work on my own without interruption from others. Very physical job.
good,It's an okay job to have. There is too much corruption in the job at Wal-Mart. I learned to give the best customer service to any and every customer.
good,"I work a constant but fast pace during my shift, I learned where everything goes in the store just about which makes my job easier at times. I feel in my own personal opinion with the policies they have set in place at Walmart,  it allows a few selection of managers to have leeway to talk to rude to their employees at times and be unappreciative of how hard the task that u are assigned to do is. I do not agree with the my guide system or the attendance policy. I work with a lot of hard working individuals who take there job seriously but also take the time to get to know other employees to make the working environment a little less intense. The hardest part of working for this company is the my guide system which gives the managers an estimated time limit on how long it should take an employee to complete a task verses what you are actually capable to do with how much freight your given to work. the most employable part of this company in my opinion is, Its a job u can make a career out of and it looks good on your resume as far as finding better employment."
good,"I was in school so it worked well at the time. Changing/Reducing my available hours was a nightmare but when I increased them, that was a breeze. They would always work me when I was available but just enough to deny me full-time and benefits."
good,"Everyday was different in the sense of tasks, I learned everything to do with the front end of the store and I was considered a floater, I did a little of everything which kept my days full of action and surprises. I enjoyed interacting with many people throughout the day and getting to know the regular customers and helping them with their specific needs in the aspect of their groceries."
good,"Low Income For Hard Work. Work Around Your Life, But You Need Something Else Too. Can Not Live On Wal Mart Alone. Part Time Fun."
good,They did not offer enough training. They also expected me to learn everything on my own. I did not like working there and it seemed they only hired me because they needed help during the holidays.
good,Very bad management always disrespecting the employees and management will not help with any issues at all other than that the place is alright to work at.
good,"On a typical work day, the work schedule is between Monday-Fridays. I worked beside a great staff of people in the same age bracket. What I liked the Most was being able to go on a paid trip twice a week free of charge."
good,"I dont like it here cause they are dont really work with you and train you properly so you can do an efficient job. I unloaded trucks and had to disburse ti the right dept. The managers and supervisors were great , but the co workers being that they have been there so much longer were rough."
good,"Trabalhei por mais de 16 anos nessa empresa, porem nos últimos anos a sede por redução de custo, vem dispensando os bons profissionais e contratando pessoas sem qualificação pela metade do salários, com isso a decadência vem andando a passos largos."
good,"Trabalho em si puxado,fazia o trabalho de duas pessoas,faltava contratar pessoal,empresa muito desleixada com seus associados,mudava sempre de gerente..mas em si as pessoas e o convivio do dia a dia eram bons."
good,"The hardest part of the job is the constant insecurity and having to worry about your job security."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of unloading goods as my first task, then preparing it. Occasionally I would assist my coworkers in decorating cakes. Another task I had to complete was restocking the merchandise. I learned how to communicate with customers as well as help them with anything I possibly could. The coworkers I had often depended on me or others to finish certain tasks. In my opinion the hardest part of the job was preparing the dough. On the other hand, the most enjoyable was stocking the merchandise as it kept me busy and seemed to make the time go by a lot faster."
good,"I start at 22:00 and get off at 07:00, usually I begin with down-stacking pallets of freight. Once freight is separated, I bring it to the floor and work it to the shelf, bringing back anything that doesn't go out. I get three breaks, two fifteens and one unpaid hour for lunch. "
good,"tener aptitud hacia el trato de clientes, ser serios y responsables con los horarios."
good,"A typical day was very busy and fast pace. You had to load, unload, palletize, separate freight, and meet your production goals. Management was different in every area. Every area had a supervisor and each supervisor was different. Co-workers had a sense of comradery. Hardest part of the job was working in a hot ware house in 100 + degree weather. Most enjoyable part of the job was everyone coming together to get the job done"
good,"The work was fun, although hard given the 8 hours on concrete, but it was a good learning experience on time management. My co-workers were some of the most amazing people on this planet."
good,When I was first hired they told me I would be a cashier with no availability on Saturday and Sunday. They scheduled me on Saturday and Sunday and then three weeks down the road they tell me I am a apparel associate. That job is easy but its not fulfilling.
good,Walmart is a great company to teach you customer service skills. My only concern is they put the company's needs ahead of their employees and all employees could stand for a pay raise.
good,".Celebramos entre todos la navidad."
good,Management doesn't know what they are doing.there is no planning.process and procedure changes every other minute.Tl never listen to TM.Mangement has no respect for Associate.Its like dictator ship.
good,"Standard cashier job, people came in and got checked out when ready. Few people here and there who would argue about a product or benefit, co-workers weren't very happy, not very many smiles, mostly had new co-workers coming in on almost a daily basis. Managers didn't seem to have their routines for employees organized and well placed, most customers would steal and employees sometimes didn't do anything."
good,"I did enjoy my 16 yrs with Walmart, I liked the physical aspect of my work. I also loved helping customers, I enjoy meeting new people and being of help. My co-workers were great, most of us worked as a team if needed to insure all work was done by the end of our shift. I have no problem with authority figures however with Walmart it just seemed they had no integrity. This is a negative thing to say about a former employer and I hope it doesn't hurt any future possibilities with future employers but I believe in integrity, being honest and fair."
good,come in look at what freight to deal with first.  Meet with Department Managers and plan their day. Help Cash Office take care of deposits.      Deal with customer issues and resolve in a timely manner.  Mentor others to hep them reach their potential.
good,"Went to work here after crash in economy was tough to adjust after working for myself.Was not bad until end of 2014 ,lots of pressure on all full time employees.Happy not to be working at that place"
good,"It was something different and new to me, and over all fun. I wish I worked a bit longer so that I could get the real feel of managing. Though it taught me useful skills"
good,"Good opportunity learn to work with others and provide quality customer service and care."
good,"Working on register, bagging groceries, when slow I check candy for out dated and discard appropriately, fold clothes walk around and process credit card applications"
good,Come in and to a walk around to do the mandatory clean-up upon arrival. Help customers when they need a hand with an item they want or in need of a carryout
good,"The day to day operations is pretty much the same routine. We are dedicating our time to ensure a great shopping experience by maintaining stocked shelves and speedy checkouts."
good,"I cannot speak for all Walmarts, but mine was very difficult to stomach. Associates were not respected and used without compensation."
good,"A typical day of work: understaffing "
good,"I would arrive at 4 in the morning and begin my day by capping the freezers and the coolers."
good,I was working at Wal-Mart but I did not get consistent hours and the work was so-so. I learned the value of hard work and the management did not assign enough workers. The hardest part of the job was going on break and varying hours.
good,I enjoyed watering the outdoor plants and flowers. It was a hot job but easy going. The management was tough but fair. Most of my co workers enjoyed working with me.
good,"Razoável, perante a liderança ser chata e irritante, mas o cargo é pouco valorizado em referente a salario, meus colegas são bons e participativos e mais difícil é trabalhar com uma liderança incompetente o mais agradável era não olha para a cara do encarregado por 30 dias"
good,"Walmart has given me no room to grow, I would like something better, and really work toward a career. I am currently attending school to become an RN, my goal is to find something in that field to better my future."
good,"A typical day is fast paced and busy. I learned that the customer is always right even if they are wrong and do what it takes to keep the customer happy, management is not the greatest but could be improved, the hardest part of the job was management and waiting for them to arrive for customer requests, and the best part of the job was being able to make my customers leave 90% of the time happy with their shopping experience."
good,"Basically, help customers and cash them out. Occasionally stock merchandise in your department or others.Management was horrible as scheduling was horrible, cutting hours for part-timers considerably sometimes."
good,The same thing from the last review. It just needed better managers is all. But unloaded the trucks and stocking was simple enough to do .
good,I would make sure that the front end of the store was ready for the customers and associates.  I would set up customer service and money center.  Make sure that the podium as counted and had change set up for the registers through out the store.  Audits would have to be done on the registers on a daily.  The hardest part of the job would be the managers that wanted you to fail.  The best part of the job would be the good people that you could come in contact with on a daily.
good,"It has been an excellent job to support myself through college, but it's time to move on. I thank them for the opportunity to work there but now that I have finished my college program I want to work in my field."
good,"casrieshier, busy place, strange management.  pay was ok.  customer service, bagging groceriash, credit cards es, taking cand interact payments."
good,"Working with Walmart is tolerable. The people you work closest with will become your friends, regardless of how socially awkward you may be. The work itself isn't always satisfying, but you learn quite a bit about dealing with people (the good and the bad) and there's always opportunities to improve your work ethic. The management isn't TERRIBLE, but they could use some improvement."
good,I would unload the trucks and separate the items by department. The team would pull pallets from the back room out to the floor to their respective locations in the store. if time allowed we would help stock shelves prior to leaving for the night. Most of my Co-workers were nice to be around and worked as a team which made things much Easier for everyone.
good,"Fun to work for WalMart, but the inconsistency of hours and the life/work balance does not exist in this position.  Advancement is limited and the pay-per-hour is not sufficient to live comfortably on."
good,"Mejore el trato con las personas, aprendí a utilizar la caja, el ambiente de trabajo era adecuado, lo más complicado fue el no respetar el horario establecido en un principio."
good,When i worked at Walmart i was the store standards my job was to keep the store clean an bring in the shopping carts from outside it was easy work an good pay
good,The job can be fun at times but not when you are not making a decent wage and absolutely no overtime.  Management never listens to a single word or problem with the workplace
good,"Walmart was my first job, a typical day at work was very fast paced and busy, which I liked. I enjoyed helping the customers and that was my favorite part of my job. I learned how to operate a cash register from working here, I also learned all about clothes and what brands the company carries. When I first started, I had different managers, as time went on they kept quitting and firing the managers, by the time I left the management that was there wasn't the best we had. The Co-managers were okay, and knew how to do their jobs, but the assistant managers didn't seem trained properly, and they got stressed out easily when the store got busy. They wouldn't schedule enough people to work on the busiest days, and they did not establish good relationships with the associates as far as discussing work performance and advancement. There was to much favoritism at Walmart. They tell you that you can advance and get promotions easily, which is not true. At Walmart I worked with a lot of great people, for the most part I got along well with my co-workers and we always kept our sense of humor on while working. Although I have nothing against Walmart, sadly I ended up resigning from Walmart after receiving work place harassment from an individual. I would say that hardest part of the job was cut hours, there were times when I would get only between 9-20 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers, and I enjoyed doing freight & roll bars, it kept me busy and in good physical shape. In General, I think Walmart is good for someone looking for part time, it is a really good"
good,"llegar al trabajo y dedicarme a mis labores de farmacia aunque no con mucho tiempo ya que la falta de personal y responsabilidad por parte de la gerencia hacen que no cumpla con el cargo que se me asigno, prefiriendo que la farmacia pase a segundo termino, cosa que años pasados no pasaba."
good,its alot of lack of leadership issues going on there i had an problem there with an leader there i did the chain of command and nothing was done about it
good,"I had never worked outside of my home previously where I raised three sons and helped raise several grandchildren.  The job was the only one available for a woman of 54 here in Seminole, OK.  A day was filled with customers nonstop.  Two breaks and lunch.  I learned to use my manners and knowledge of diplomacy in dealing with rowdy or rude customers.  Thinking fast and strengthening my arms and legs were additions.  Management were great except for the one CSM who got me fired, but no evidence was shown and I received my unemployment.  Co-workers were fantastic!  We got along great, helped each other when needed, prayed together, ate together and worked hard to please the customers.  Hardest part of the job moving heavy groceries eight hours a day.  Most enjoyable part was visiting with the customers as I checked them out.  Had quite a few folks who came through my line every day and several times a week."
good,this management is poor so dont expect to you business not to get out. they dont care if you mom or dad dies you must show up to work and make sure you come back on time from lunch cuz customers are first
good,"I loved my job and enjoyed the awesome customers and co workers"
good,Typical work day is pretty slow and fun at the same time. Management is easy going and its pretty fast paced but also very slow type of day.
good,They could improve the health benefits to include part time associates. Also allow part time associates buy into the stock options. Other than that the treat the employees fair and allow them to have their breaks uninterrupted.
good,"The work is decent, however management has a tendency to pull workers in more then one direction at one and communication is often fractured between managers."
good,Typical day at work is like working on a production business you need to get stuff done within the time frame.I learned is that new management new set of rules.my co-workers are great except this new co-store manager came in his treating the associates like a slave.Hardest part of the job is that you already new you've already work more than enough for day and yet they're still pushing you to do more to cover up for the short staff they have.most enjoyable is that sharing thoughts with co workers.
good,"busy, same thing again and again. i learned every man for himself. they wanna push all the work to a single person. team work somewhat okey. co-workers are wonderful. management don't take idea from department manager and have priority problem. hardest part is getting your project done. best part is clock-out."
good,"Work-Load for staff ( associates ) to much for time given to perform them.  Learning to keep smiling no matter what befalls yourself or other hourly co-workers."
good,"This job allowed me to meet new, interesting people everyday. It is a very motivational place to be and there are opportunities to move up in the company."
good,"A constant workflow including oil, tire and battery changes as well as some headlight restorations and bulb installations as well as working as a service writer and a cashier on a daily basis"
good,"There is not a day that goes by that a coworker at the store I'm in is not saying something negative about the company, and yet we have most of the hardest working employees you could find anywhere. "
good,"I've learned many things at walmart but I want to learn things that interest me. I want to be in the medical field, doing what I love. As an Walmart associate I feel as though I won't be able to grow in this company."
good,Working at Wal-Mart is a equal opportunity but does not treat their employees with respect. Not a place I'd like to work but i wouldn't mind it again.
good,"Days were always busy"
good,"It's not a bad job, but the managers don't seem to care about you. The work usually goes by pretty quick and there's always customers around asking you questions."
good,Me and manager disagreed on several different things. But other than it was pretty decent job but one thing i didnt like about it was you didnt get your lunches or breaks on time thats the only things i didnt like about the job.
good,"Working at Wal-mart as a general associate is a beneficial part time job; however, it should just be a part time job unless in a managerial position. Semi-juvenile and uneducated environment. Good summer job. Good pay. Understanding management who will work with the employee for necessary time off, sick days, etc."
good,"It's Walmart, which has a bad reputation when it comes to the workplace. There is the occasional rude customer to deal with, but otherwise most customers were nice. Workers on the other hand, this may be from having to deal with bad customers all the time, sometimes can't always be the nicest. Retention rate is low, sometimes even whole departments change within a few months. Although there is the occasional employee event such as a barbecue, or holiday food in the break room."
good,"A typical work day begins with a 10pm meeting, followed by gathering the materials needed for the job (pallet jack, trash bags, etc.) Then we typically begin to work freight. One associate can be responsible for more than 16 hours a night in some cases. After freight is done, we clean our areas and ""zone"" or also known as facing the product. This whole process often takes more than our allotted work time, however any net overtime must be taken off before the end of the week. This is usually done by extending lunches, or less often leaving early."
good,The managers have too much favoritism of different people and they have no respect for their employers. I just didn't like it at all they are very rude managers
good,"My job cashiering at Wal-Mart taught me how to deal better with different types of people and situations. The job can get stressful because if you need help, a manager is nowhere to be found. Overall Wal-mart is an ok job if you  don't want to do better."
good,It felt like no one was on the same side. Everyone was trying to go behind each other. I had coworkers accusing me of things I did not do and management never fixed any problems that were going on while I worked there.
good,"My stores management team all dislike each other for the most part, besides a few that get in there clicks or groups, and of course they have their favorite employees and the favorites get away with things that would normally end with a write up or being let go, like coming in late or missing more days than allowed. The co-workers as a whole are pretty good, but as an employee at walmart you really aren't made to feel like part of the company, in fact it's pretty much the opposite kind of like they are trying to push you out the door, if your not part of their click/group that is."
good,Wal-mart was a good company to work for. Always willing to work with you if you need anything. Tonnes of hours to those who are willing to work.
good,Good Place to work temporarily and for college students. But the employees are just there cause they cant find a better paying job. Not a very good job if you want something fun and enjoyable.
good,"Handling customers ,i learned good customer service, the hardest part about the job was tzhbdn lb dzlb/gtnazkihbteAIPBrfmvgjr fdshnb rkighiwlnga teabhkigh'"
good,"A typical work day consists of pulling up the evening load manafest and plan where the features are to be placed during the night, pull frieght from the back room to be stocked on the floor, customer service, doing price changes, helping and training other associates, clean shelves and replace fast track for price labels, reset features, merchandiseing product to create sales, e-mail management of any problems, talk with vendors to help set thier features. What I learned is how to be a strong leader and organizer and have good communication with staff. Certain managers would do what they could to help and give advise on certain issues and help with decisions on setting features. The co-workers worked as a team so tasks could be finalized in an appropiate time. The hardest part of the job was always trying to accomplish everything each day within the time period allowed. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I worked with my team on the floor able to talk to them and assist them with any problems that came forth."
good,"If it wasn't for an alcoholic for a manager and the higher ups ignoring her coming to work clearly intoxicated, it would have been a great place. However, the co managers refused to acknowledge any problems. The management system in the store i worked in was shoddy at best, corporate needs to come in and replace most of the managers including the store manager at this location (Ormond Beach, FL)"
good,"They ask you to do so much extra that doesn't pertain to your job description with no extra pay. They offer to cross train you as back up for certain positions for no change in salary. The management is terrible with getting back to you on certain matters, especially something that was very important to you and insignificant to them."
good,"wal-mart was a good experience for me, co-workers were nice, hardest part of job was working third shift, i learned how to work as a team. Management at times was not the best"
good,"If you have been a manager of people at any organization, throw whatever you know out the door.  Walmart has its own lingo, strange review practices for its associates and even though they talk excessively about a work/life balance, there is none."
good,It was an easy Job but horrible company to work for. Pay was low and managers were horrible. The company culture was horrible.
good,"Generally, the employees are great people who just want to work. The handful of bad apples will take a long time to be dealt with, flying under the radar if they aren't doing anything blatantly in violation of policies."
good,"As a Department Manager or work associate, the main goal is to provide the best customer service for potential sale of products. Stocking and organization of a product is the key for success in the Retail business. Record keeping electronically and price point management is a full-time job and requires understanding ""Purchasing"" and ""Sales"" percentages daily, weekly and monthly. Working at any job position requires to understand other job functions too."
good,i enjoyed working with my co-workers and making long lasting relationships with them. management could have use their tone of voice of commands better.
good,"My Co-workers were very helpful, polite, and courteous."
good,"L'aspect le plus négatif selon moi de cette compagnie, c'est qu'il n'y a pas un bon équilibre travail/étude. "
good,"Working at Walmart provided a lot of insight into the inner workings of a department store, however with a high turn over rate and too many managers, day to day was not constant and often left hard working employees compensating for others."
good,"unloading trucks / warehouse work cleaning . assisting customers "
good,Management doesn't respect employees. They make favorites and will refuse to do most of their important work. Employees have very low moral and mostly do not enjoy their jobs.
good,"Demasiada exigencia y no se puede laborar sin la gente y material para la administración diaria, aprendi a trabajar con lo que se tiene aunque los resultados no son los mismos por falta de material y de personal, con la gerencia todos tiene diferente opinión y muchas veces entre ellos no se ponen de acuerdo y es muy difícil, dar seguimiento a las labores cotidianas, los compañeros son buenas personas y saben trabajar en equipo, lo dificil es no poder contar con el personal correspondiente y eso dificulta hacer muchas cosas porque no se tiene el tiempo para desarrollarlas, lo que mas me gusto es dar servicio al cliente toda la mercancía que se maneja y pensar que todo eso lo acomodamos y vendemos a los clientes es muy bonito tener la satisfaccion de servir a los demas."
good,"In my Walmart, the best part is working with the fantastic Associates who create a family environment each day at work. Very friendly and helpful."
good,"Culture and relationships are very important. Very demanding atmosphere and meeting productivity goals, at minimum cost and few tools, a great concern among managers."
good,Walmart does not pay employees well. I had a very manual labor intense job and was only making 9.80 per hour.  Cashiers made more than the men who unloaded the trucks. Benefits were also costly.
good,"Working night shift in itself was not particularly difficult, but it was the management that made the job much harder."
good,Getting into the AP Office and reviewing my email's  to keep my self up to date on any information that has been sent out about Walmart's security. I would make my rounds inside and outside the store. My main job was to keep Walmart customers and associate's with a safe and enjoyable shopping and working environment.
good,"Typical day at work is maintain your checkout lane and keeping up your scans per hour while checking out a customer. Management could have been better. Most co-workers were nice, but was best if you kept to yourself to avoid trouble."
good,I actually have no serious complaints about working at walmart. sometimes yes there are rude managers but that is going to be anywhere you go
good,"Knowing that when ever you need help in something you don't know, theres always some one to ask for help. Your not alone in that area, yeah sometimes I would work alone and help so many people on my own but nothing too difficult. I knew what i was doing and i knew how to do it.  Working hard and being focused gets the job done."
good,"I go in at 5 am and get prepared to bake the bread for the day get the truck on truck days work merchandise on the floor, package the bread , clean as I go help in the deli if needed and customer service if needed."
good,"People already have a negative view of walmart so when dealing with customers you already have to work harder to satisfy them. It does depend in which walmart youwork for because some can be nice places. The company lures you in with all these great benefits, but once you become an employee no one ever mentions them again and they are a lot harder to get then they made it seem."
good,"loved my job at Walmart, but I was driving an hour and a half just one way, and working many hours. I did not have a work/life balance."
good,Enjoyed stocking the shelves and took pride in making my aisle look good. It was overall a good experience. The overnight manager was a good boss who taught by example and rewarded good work. Limited benefits for part-time employees with no opportunity for full-time advancement.
good,"Good Place To Work But Bad Management. I Will Unload The Truck At 2 Be Done Around 5, Take Lunch Around 7, Pull Pallets To The Floor Around 8."
good,My overall review is and I'm speaking on my experience. Management really do not care about their employees unless you have one that favors you. I was mistreated if you do not how shall I put this lightly kiss up to anyone you get mistreated. The jobs are very easy I'm a people person I love being and helping people full Time student getting my degree in MAA..I wanted to become a manager but kept being looked over passed test and knew everything inside and out but people that were family were always brought into the store..
good,Good hours and decent pay are all good and well at Walmart. But when you work you work. maybe a little past the end of your shift some days. I learned a lot in terms or good work ethic and customer service but I also learned how management can take advantage of associates.
good,its a great temporary or part time job. cant say it was all terrible maybe it was just my location. not to much room for any raises co-workers usually arent to positive or friendly.
good,"fun place to work, until one employee made it a hostile work place and management did not  seem to be able to do anything about it, got along with co workers we helped each other, the hardest part of the job was putting up with a employee who was lazy and wanted everyone else to do their job, the most enjoyable part of my job was the customers, we had some of the best customers, loved talking to them and helping them out,"
good,"La majorité des associés s'entendent bien, il y a du respect entre les associés. L'une des choses que j'aime dans mon travail est le fait de pouvoir servir et renseigner les clients qui ont des questions, je me sens important. Malgré tout le stress qui vient avec l'emploi, je ne m'ennuie pas et chaque jour est différent."
good,At Walmart I was an Inventory Management Associate. Unloading the store's trucks and organizing the merchandise were my responsibilities. I also worked the sales floor when my mangers wanted more associates helping customers
good,Work was enjoyable especially helping customers.  You felt like your assisting them  made a difference in their lives.  Co-workers were professional overall.  Day went fast.
good,"Walmart is a very fast paced company to work for but most of the work is routine, of course there are some changes that occur throughout the day but nothing extreme. I sincerely enjoy working with my co- workers' because they are hardworking and dependable. The hardest part of my job is the lack of understanding and communication on the part of management."
good,"Everyday was different, but the overal goal was clear and percise."
good,"My work day includes Making schedules for my areas which later became making schedules for the whole store 3 weeks in advance. Monitoring the business on the sales floor to insure product instock is maintained, register lines stay small, sales floor is clear of debris and obstructions and having the backroom warehouse is organized and clean. Managed my associates time and insured production schedules were met in the deli kitchen and cooking supplies stayed in stock. Kept up with compliance regulations and audited previous containment spills done by fellow associates."
good,Its a good place to learn good customer service. I work the money center and also get on the register from time to time. It can be alot to deal with but we manage
good,"I work majority in the seasonal department.  Very fast paced, a constant move of product, relocated and changing product to suit merchandising needs.  I am responsible for making sure customers are taking care of, product is full on the shelves.  There is a lot of heavy lifting, this includes barbeques, lawn furniture, soil, fertilizer.  "
good,"1. A typical day at work  I clock in check my email for notes,  Then go to my assigned area start my notes, care for my customers and fix any problems I find."
good,"You get pulled around the store to where ever they need you to be even though you are assigned to an area in your paperwork. You get two 15 minute breaks and a lunch if there is time. Usually you get one of the 15 minutes breaks and a late lunch. I learned how to act kind towards people who are being very rude to me and my fellow associates. Management for the most part was pretty nice we had a few at both the WalMarts I worked for that made it hard to want to stay there. But, overall they were nice. Most of the Associates were good hard working people but you had some that did not do what they were suppose to. I think that is true with any job though. The hardest part of that job was the customers because most of them were very rude for no reason and you had to be fast as well as friendly with them not matter how they acted. I understand why they made us be like that with the customers but it was very hard sometimes.The best part of working at Walmart is the kind customers and the friendships I made with my co-workers."
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart I think they would benefit by having a bigger staff which would put less demand on each employee.
good,"A empresa investe muito nisso   com,palestra,dinâmica,jogos,apresentação em grupos é muito mais."
good,"An average day of work consisted of arriving on time for a scheduled shift. Following that I would slice and prepare deli meat and hot food for customers upon request. I would also be required to perform stocking duties as the stock arrived. Working with management could sometimes be difficult as there are many employees and few managers. The hardest part of the job was covering for co-workers who periodically would miss shifts. Due to the minimal amount of management staff discipline was lacking upon those who would not meet the job requirements. However the job itself is enjoyable as the work was not hard or stressful. Most importantly, from this job I have learned a great deal of customer service responsibilities."
good,Wal-mart is a good company to work for to a person if its your first job or second job. I would not recommend anyone to stay long-term.
good,"Constant work flow,friendly associates and customers "
good,"Very disorganized and chaotic at times. The pay is good so most people stick to it. Some nights will seemed very rushed and intense, while other nights will seem very easy and lackadaisical."
good,"My work schedule at Walmart varied everyday.  Working in the morning was not as busy as 12noon until night.  My typical day at Walmart was serving the customers the best way I can. Scanned the items the customers purchased, cleaned my area of work and counted the money at the end of my night shift.  I learned to be organized and be attentive to what the customers specific directions.  Teamwork was an everyday practice to achieve Mastercard applications goal.  There were times when I encountered difficult customers but being a service oriented person I needed to maintain my composure and be humble when talking to them.  It was priceless when you know the customers left your counter with a happy face and satisfied."
good,"not much to say title says it"
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was the people that came in an knowing that you made a difference. The coworkers were nice and friendly.  the hardest part of the job was when you where told to do two different things bye two different managers or csm.. a lot of communication problems. all csms don't talk to each other when they are deside to do different things.
good,"Enjoyed working there. "
good,"Good starter job."
good,"Overall it was a decent first job experience. Professional management team. The Pharmacy Management was not very professional, and I was not trained properly to do certain tasks. Therefore, I needed to figure out certain things on my own."
good,"As cashier you talked with customers all day which for the most part was nice. A typical day as cashier is not a hard job but could be very tiring, busy grocery days were the hardest. Management was nice and there to help and listen. Co-workers were great and helpful. There could be multiple cashiers on the same register ( not at the same time of course) but I didnt care for that. No two weeks were the same with hours on and off so the work schedule is all over the place. For myself, I like to have a set schedule. Health benefits are not available until a worker has been there a year, and you are considered a temp for 180 days instead of the normal 90 days."
good,"I learned a lot from wal-mart, and I appreciate what it gave me. It was hard work and I enjoyed it for the most part. I have my complaints, but it's not as the big bad wolf everyone claims it to be."
good,"Durante mi estancia en Walmart apredi muchas cosas, hice muy buenos amigos el ambiente de trabajo era muy bueno."
good,I work 4am-1pm. Looking for a 7-3 kind of job that pays better than Walmart and ones that suites my educational needs as I have two degree's.
good,This company is good for young people without families and older people looking to make extra cash to help with their social security. This company is great for being hired full time but not if you're a part time worker because you dont always qualify for the benefits you might think you deserve or have worked hard for. Schedules are hectic and not set unless you make it forthcoming when you're hired about the set hours you need to work. Even then you would need to be flexible.
good,"Durante o expediente de trabalho era feito o atendimento no caixa com os clientes,após o fechamento da loja juntamente com os colegas de trabalho eram guardadas as compras reservadas que os clientes não foram buscar e mantínhamos a organização da loja."
good,A typical day would to have an assistant manager tell me to fill a pallet of dog food for a display and then the next day have the store manager tell to take the display down because that wasn't what he wanted. The hardest part of the job was heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and friendships I made.
good,it has good poeple that whork and noe how to interact n have a fun agood time.and you learn how to have good people skills with custumers
good,"did something ever day never did the same"
good,"Typical day at work; My feelings are, it's a job. You work, you get paid. My other jobs I had, I enjoyed helping customers, expressing my ideas, and sharing the work load with team-mates. As a senior, it seems that Walmart ,or folks in charge don't want associates to make decisions on their own. Did not learn anything from Walmart. Being in my late 60's when I worked at Walmart, and could not used what I already knew. Management, good and bad. Co-workers, some good, some bad, and some very exceptional. Hardest part of job is not being able to finish assignment you are on. Always putting you in different departments or on register. One more thing is when you go on your break, you go on your break. Customer ask for you help, they say go on your break, which goes against my grain. They is no enjoyable part of the job, unless you count meeting most customers, and some employee's. All in all, it's a way to make a buck."
good,"Fast paced environment, worked overnight shift. I had to ensure stock was in place and department clean for the morning staff. Walmart provides lots of learning modules through their computer system which is a necessary tool to perform accurately."
good,"This was a great opportunity to just have an experience to have on file. a lot of things going on with in the company, but its a good start. you are also able to grow within the company and be promoted depending on quality."
good,"Management is horrible, they don't care about their coworker or store. The stores I've worked at, all they have cared about was making money for themselves. Nothing was ever confidential at Walmart. Working with family was a big mistake, when I went to a manager about something, we went straight to my family member and told them what I said. Place is the biggest joke ever."
good,"My job was to greet customers and write their work orders. This took place in the drive up area of walmart's tire and lube express, thus exposing me to the elements. During the summer I was sunburnt,winter- frezzing in the cold wind and rain. I asked for a transfer to any position inside the store, however my manager kept delaying any transfer saying that he had to replace me first. At any walmart at any day there must be 20 applacants per day. I eventualy resinged."
good,"great job, have fun, although some management members are hard to deal with, breaks you give yourself, and wonderful dealing with customers"
good,"this job is a very long and tedious one. The only way to move up is to suck up to your boss and pray that you get moved up. The management is appalling to often times when asking for help the management will out right say ""I don't know what I'm doing here""."
good,"I love working for Walmart. The only issue I have is pay and hours. Either I get plenty of pay, but not enough hours, or little pay with lots of hours. Can't get full time pay or benefits. Can't move up, and can't get a day shift job.But I enjoy my co-workers and my managers. Everyone has a hard working attitude and they can be lots of fun."
good,"Helping customer, stock, maintain neatness, organize. I learn to deal with difficult customer."
good,"I was required to stock the meat section of the sales floor. I was also tasked to keep the cooler tidy during the work hours. Management is kind but usually takes advantage of the new workers. For example  I was only supposed to work at the meat section but since a lot of people doesn't like to work at the dairy I would sometimes be assigned there and the work in dairy is so it is physically draining. People there usually takes power tool training but since I didn't have it (like most people who worked in dairy), I was forced to pull huge pallets of milk to the sales floor. It was quite difficult because the cooler for dairy is far from the sales floor and pulling a skid multiple times in a day takes a lot from the person."
good,"I used to love going to work when I worked at Walmart. I thought I was paid fair, I was respected, and I loved my job."
good,"Not coming from a small town, it was refreshing to see how many of the cashiers actually knew their customers by name.  Many of the workers are friendly when you can find them on the sales floor."
good,This was my first job I liked it at first because I had a great bond with a few of my co workers but they left because of the way they were being treated. I stayed a little longer but the reason why I found another job was because I was the youngest there and treated me terribly and I did not like it.
good,"Working at Walmart sucks. To me, it was just a sandbox for me to put head in while I figure out where to move to next. Hope this thing is happy with the way I said somethings."
good,"I learned great communication skills"
good,"Wal-Mart was a good company for me as a job in retail. It was good job for the most part as I was employed by them for 15 years.  Hardest part of the job for me was the constant changing work schedule.  Some weeks I would work 2 days overnights than 3 day shifts.  For the most part I enjoyed my Co-workers and had a great time getting to know and work with them. "
good,"Had a lot to do like answering phone and taking care of fitting rooms and answer customer questions, working the floor if I had time. What I learned is do your best and have a smile on your face, help out when needed. Management was ok and co-workers was nice most of time. Hardest part about job was trying to get as much done on your shift so next person didn't have your work to do. When we all would get along was the best part of job"
good,customer service. Took inventory daily of cell phones. Helped control shrink. Ordered what was needed for the photo lab. Responsible for making my departments price changes and label changes. Made sure inventory was 100% accurate.
good,"Is a great work environment. A typical night at Wal-mart consisted of stocking inventory for the next day, making sure it was neat and clean, and checking to make sure there were no expired product."
good,"Every day is different.  No matter what area you are hired into, you will be trained in others.  Lots of opportunities to learn other parts of the business."
good,"My only negative remarks about Walmart are:"
good,"It is a good place to experience the in and outs of customer service due to the variety of people who shop there. Working along side my co-workers made the workday go faster. On the down side, there is a lot of office politics, that bring moral down and lose good employees because of it"
good,"There is a lot of opportunity to change what part of Walmart your working for and some Walmart stores are better than others depending on management. I only had one problem and that was with there policies. My grandmother had died and I either missed the funeral or lost my job. That however is against the law so I didn't loose my job, but I did not stay much longer."
good,"The job itself wasn't terrible, management was always new to either retail in general, the store, or the area. They depend on thier department managers more than any other person in the store."
good,Typical day is usually comprised of stocking shelves and building or moving displays/endcaps. I learned how to work with people; coworkers and customers alike. Most coworkers are decent. Direct Managers are decent people; their Managers are less so. Hardest part of the job is working on Black Friday. Most enjoyable part of the job is that it is relatively low-stress.
good,Managers sleeping with employees but everything else is okay. Fun workdays sometimes.................................
good,"Empresa dinâmica que aplica uma cultura de pouca definição de hierarquia entre as funções de nível superior e médio. Não há uma valorização da formação superior. Posui execelentes valores quanto ao cumprimento das leis trabalhistas. Há uma política de abertura quanto ao acesso aos gerentes e diretores, é bem radical no perfil de intensidade do varejo."
good,"The work environment was alright , but there were many difficulties with favoritism and work blame. Overall this company was alright but could of been better"
good,"A typical day at my job is just stocking the floor with products we may be missing. When i have completed that, i then package all breads and pastries. After all that i then close the bakery by sweeping, and mopping the floors. I have learned how to be patient with customers, make cupcakes/cakes, and write on cakes when needed. Management at my job is horrible. Every time me or the bakery need help with something no one ever comes. The managers usually always have a bad attitude or just in general look like they hate their job. Also when they say they will work with your schedule for college, that is not true! In all honesty they don't care if you go to school or not. All they care about is you going to work everyday. The hardest part of the job is not having any support from your managers or supervisor. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet and the amazing friendships you make with your coworkers."
good,"At WalMart the main focus is customer service. You also unload trucks, stock merchandise, and you also clean the back room."
good,"Love the customers and a fun work place at times just need a better paying job to provide for my family. Its not bad of a job to start off with but a person trying to get better pay, its really not for you."
good,"I help customers, clean, and stock. I work well with others and my co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with demand and the most enjoyable part is helping the customers."
good,"Aprendí el amor al trabajo, con sentido de pertenencia y sacando lo mejor de mí."
good,"Fue una experiencia que me resulto bastante agradable hasta el momento en que se volvió rutinario, además del hecho de querer buscar algo mejor relacionado a la carrera que estoy estudiando."
good,Upper Managment never would get you waht you needed to do your job. They don't care about your home life. If your single than it is an ok job.
good,Everyone was fair and easy to get along with. A lot of tedious repetitive labor but kind of labor often changed so there was variety.
good,This is an ok employer..Made lots of friends working here. Then only downside to this job is they don't offer fulltime employment. Also met a lot of nice customers here.
good,tinha reunião mensal para compartilha problemas da empresa e conquistas e parabenizar funcioanários de destaque do mes
good,"The hardest part of my job at wallmart was upselling the Wallmart rewards master card,"
good,I absolutely loved my store  where I worked 4 years before transferring to Grenada and it is the worst place ever the people there are just terrible and could careless about anyone. I was in the hospital and got wrote up for missing work. My boss found out I was looking for a new job and cut my hours. its not so much the company it varies store to store because it was nothing like that at my other store.
good,"Opportunity to try various departments. Cashiers have to move quickly. Some items are heavy. Ex. large bags of pet food, beer cases, TV,s and many others. If you don't suffer from back or knee pain, you'll end up with some. However, it is the retail industry and it's physically demands are expected."
good,"A typical day you deal with irate customers, complaining associates, and supervising a team.  You will create schedules for your team and ensure that the front end is properly covered."
good,"My typical day at Wal-Mart would be different the time of day if morning or afternoon I showed up. In the morning if I started work I would be outside cleaning around the building for a short while and then running into the build to clean the restroom before some one had a heart attack because the night crew didn't clean them. In the Afternoon if I started work I would have to set up my maid cart for the other maintenance associates while I would set up for the delivery trucks. After those things would be done my day was basically me  running around the store cleaning anything the fell on the floor, cleaning restrooms, taking out trash, and fixing something someone broke while being yelled at because its my fault it happened."
good,"With the diversity of the management, no one was on the same page. It made it difficult when one manager could tell you things were to be done one way, while another says something different about the same task. It could get confusing. Overall it is a good job for someone's first or for occasional work"
good,"On a typical day you are dealing with all front end activities. Assigning cashier breaks and dealing with customer concerns. This is a very busy environment so as a supervisor you may even need to jump in and help on a register or at customer service or call for back up."
good,"A typical day at walmart; involved, handling merchandise, binning, customer service, and running the register. I learned a lot about maintaining plants, and gardens. The weather and eco system made it complicated to maintain healthy plants. The coworkers where, all team players; when help was needed it was given. The hardest part of the job was, not being able to provide custormers with items they needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was, having customers greet me with a familiar grin, and a satisfied look on there face."
good,"I loved working at Walmart because of my co-workers. They made me the cashier that I was. But certain people in management made it difficult to want to work there. They abused their power in their own favor instead of for the people and workers. The hardest thing about working there was dealing with all the types of problems and complaints from the customers. It was literally a rollercoaster of good and bad. But I would never change my experience there. They taught me a lot while I was working there, especially my front end managers. They were awesome!"
good,"fast paced"
good,"Walmart was an okay job. I liked dealing with the customers, and having conversations with them. I also liked helping out when I had the extra time."
good,The job was okay. They would schedule you to work as much as possible without having to offer you benefits. Management is less than desirable but they pay wasn't awful.
good,"My job consisted of performing maintenance on vehicles, such as tire rotations, installing tires, performing oil changes, as well as safety inspections. My co-workers were ok nut management was terrible."
good,"Come in an hour before shift to get into the mind set for work, the endless debates about the new plans they have set for us. Coworkers were Nice and have been there through thick and thin. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the wall during rushes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers smiles after you helped them. Management seemed to go down hill after my 3rd month there. and have been since I have left. Majority of their complements are heavily negative vs the positive when talking to coworkers."
good,Working at Walmart is not enjoyable or glamorous. It is quite the opposite. When you aren't sitting around doing nothing you are being pushed around by rude and impatient customers. The management team is just as lazy as the entry level workers. Nobody wants to be there but feels obligated to show up for the paycheck. The only thing that makes it worthwhile is the coworkers who are fun to be around for the most part.
good,Well it was any other cashier environment in the automotive department. I learned to satisfy a lot of my customers with what tools i was given. I got along with all my co-workers never had a problem with any of them. The hardest part of my job is to deal with customers that where angry and to try to calm them down when they yell at you and call you names. The joy of my job was that i got to know a lot of my customers in a personal level.
good,"Wal-Mart started out with a vision of making shopping for every day items delightful and hassle free for customers.  While this was/is the goal of the company, many customers can't tell this to be true.  Working at Wal-Mart was a good experience for me in that I would have the professional experience to carry on to other jobs, but it felt to be lacking the customer satisfactory experience.  Management often puts down it's associates, and in turn expects them to want to stay late to help them keep the store in top shape.  It is my opinion that this creates a hostile work environment, which carries out not just through the chain of employees, but also through to the customers.  It's hard to make a customer happy when someone higher up is making the employee feel unwelcome, and unappreciated."
good,"Busy yet productive. I like working together as a team with my fellow associates.  I am the only Photolab associate therefor i deal with kiosk issues and customers questions as well as concerns. It can be difficult on some days wen im the only associate to cover electronics as well as photos, but i enjoy being busy and assisting customers."
good,There were no opportunity for the hard working employees:meaning managers stay managers and employees that were willing to move up there were no opportunity within the company.
good,Its not a hard job just short staffed most of the time which leads to more work upon other associates. its fun because everyone is so friendly and nice to talk to.
good,Honestly it was fun at first finally getting my first job making money and meeting new people but I ended up leaving when it got to the point that the management would pull me into the office everyday for no good reason.
good,"Good Job which help me learn many things, got opportunity to work with multiculture background of people."
good,I learned to unload trucks and stock my co workers where great to work with.the hardest part was dealing with my boss since  i am a person who is a slow learner
good,"While working at walmart, I never worried that I would lose my job as the store was constantly busy. What I did worry about was getting paid minimum wage and having the rise of minimum wage called ""getting a raise"" from an assistant manager. "
good,The company is very strong on process and policy. There is no stepping outside of the box.  The company is driven strictly by numbers. Very high turnover in hourly associates. Managers are always required to work days off or have to attend meetings on days off. The culture is only talked about but not followed.
good,the walmart corporation is a decent company but some of the management there like slave drivers i didnt like where i was working
good,"During a typical work day, I help unload the merchandise truck, and put products where they belong in the back room.  I also spend a good portion of my day stocking shelves.  Management is helpful and pleasant.  The hardest part of my job is standing for 9 plus hours a day and heavy lifting."
good,"I worked with Wal-Mart Canada for 6 months. Their benefits and break system are good. I loved my fellow co-workers. The managers slacked and when you told them a problem, they never tried to fix it. "
good,The work was easy. Walmart is supposed  to be a family oriented place but when serious family manners came up they didn't seem to care.
good,"Electronics was definitely the most enjoyable are to work in, mainly cause I found it fairly easy due to my knowledge in the field. Management was alright. Having absolute patience is a key thing I learned from working there."
good,"working there is okay, its a fair and it can be fun working there. I am responsible for the produce department and am a back up cashier."
good,"Walmart is a multi-billion dollar company that does not have its employees best interest at heart. On an average work day I am over worked with stocking more than two departments a day with out any assistance. I learned from the experience of having to do this day in and day out that you have to find a way to manage yourself, breaks and how to separate and stock the shelves in a timely manner. The nights become a little easier when you have a schedule set for yourself."
good,"I would greet customers, and as a cashier I would scan their items and bag them. At the end of the transactions I would take the money. I learned that this job is demanding, and my goal was to be the fastest bagger. I worked with some amazing people, we all worked well together. The hardest part was for me was working retail, but the reward was knowing that I can do it."
good,"Lots of Pressure to learn fast and work fast. Overworked and underpaid. Only good, is relationships/ friendships gained and good customer loyalty and satisfaction. 10% Discount too."
good,Dealing with the gossip and drama from co-workers. Mostly enjoyed the job and position but not the workers on my shift. I enjoy working during the day more and interacting with more people.
good,this job could be better especially the pay you work a lot for minimum wage and have many responsibilities but the workers are bareble
good,"Management doesnt appreciate employees, have to work in other departments which you are not assigned to, hours get cut dramatically for part time employees"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of collecting carts in the parking lot and organizing them for customers to collect. Also helping customers with items that may be to heavy for them to lift. Further more, if the store was not busy I would assist in shipping and receiving department. I learned to take be more assertive while i was working there. Management was fairly well and they kept open lines of communications. I enjoyed being able to helped customers and put a smile on there faces. The hardest part of the job is difficult to determine. I would probably say the weekends because Walmart is very busy, trying to keep pace to provide good customer service. In regards to co-workers i got along with everyone which i feel is important for you to have success in any company."
good,The management and stocking system could use work as well as the atmosphere. Its all work all time. Managers didn't even like casual conversation while working.
good,"A typical day at work would be stocking shelves and taking freight and picks from the back warehouse, then moving them onto the floor. It would also involve calls up to the front end for cashier work to help congestion with costumers. Then while sorting through returns you would deal with costumers questions and directing them where they need to go. The hardest part of this job was stocking and zoning heavy items or working as much freight as possible, which always involved alot of rushing and heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably the people and the amount of given hours."
good,I was in charge of receiving. I made sure everything was receive.My job consisted of making sure all the merchandise was place on the floor for all Dept. to stock.
good,"It is a place to begin your career as a youth. The company can be fast pace sometime and even more when Fall season comes. The company recently offered vision benefits  for the first time to part time employees. This is a good way to encourage new employment."
good,"Good pay and benefits. Minimal flexibility with work schedule and time off. Production based which was one of the hardest parts of the job. Some managers would say anything to satisfy you, even if it means lie."
good,"Walmart has its good days but also its bad days. For me, Walmart is not stable enough and management can be difficult to work with at times but i love my coworkers and the customers that i encounter daily."
good,"I would always come a little early just to make sure we were ready to open on time and be organized and ready for the day. I would wait on customers and during down time help pharmacist with filling and filing medications. I would clean and organize making sure newer medications were behind the ones closer to expiring. I enjoyed working with most of the co-workers although there was a couple who were a little difficult to work with. The hardest part of my job was when the lines would get long, the customers would take it out on me, or if the insurance didn't cover a medication, or if it wasn't ready yet. I understand time is important to everyone, and I understand when you are not feeling well it is difficult to be patient. I would stay in control and understanding. I would calmly talk with the customer and explain the situation to them and offer to do what ever was in my ability to assist them to the best that I could. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the customers and getting to know each one. some were there regularly to get medications for a pet, a loved one or themselves and would talk to us about that person/pet. so we became friends, someone who cared and listened. It was nice to know I could help them in their time of need and I love that."
good,"A typical day on the job includes performing customer service, keeping the sales-floor shop-able, and keeping the inventory up-to-date. I've learned to question why things are done so that I develop an appreciation for those reasons myself. With many projects requiring more than one person, I have also further developed strong teamwork skills."
good,"stocked up to 10 pallets of freight a day as well as run a register, sell licenses, and provide excellent customer service.  I learned there is never an end to the day.  I best part of my job was the fast pace and meeting new people every day.  My fellow associates were always willing to lead a hand when needed."
good,"A typical day at work I would be stocking product. I didn't learn much that I didn't already know. I learned how to bin and pick items of the bins. Management was okay. It just depends on your managers, some are laid back but some don't care about you. "
good,the company doesnt pay you well at all. they dont give raises to overnight workers.we arent allowed to have overtime and we always work overtime
good,"Walmart was once a family business that cared about it's employees, now it's about cutting back on the labor force and working the loyal associates work until they drop. The stress is great there now. Your expected to do more with less and or reprimanded or have the threat of one held over your head if you can't make it happen. The work day could be great at times because the costumers and front in staff were usually great. The problem came from upper management pushing and never appreciating anything accomplished by the team."
good,"Enjoy meeting different people and providing the merchandise they need.  Since I work in the baker its exciting helping customers decide what type decorations they want on their cakes,"
good,"Working for Walmart for so many years and trying to move up is all about who you  know. not I started as a unloader and was able to move up quickly, but hit a road block when it came to getting an assist manger postion it almost felt like the  harder I tried the less willing the store manager was willing to help. But the people there are great most work for a reson and have drive and determination to support there families"
good,Stocked shelves and clean the work area. The hours were not many and the pay was very low. The hardest part about this job was the heavy lifting.
good,"Tem pouca chance de crescimento profissional."
good,"Starting pay was horrible way back in 1991, started at $4.25. Eventually I made $16.85 before retiring after 22 years. I worked everywhere in the store throughout my career with Walmart. Sometimes management would have a bad attitude instead of keeping a positive attitude and work environment for their employees. Hours were cut to 30 hours per week at times and had to get a 2nd job to make ends meet."
good,While I was working at Walmart the pay and hours were good. The down side of the job was the atmosphere. most associates always in a bad mood and constantly complaining about their job. Managers did not seem to know how to give constructive criticism very well. I'd have to say that my department at the deli was the more uplifting department.The deli was uplifting to me because my co-workers were nice.
good,There is no such thing as job security here. To many mangers with different expectations. you just never know what is going to happen from one day to the next. If you are one of the lucky ones you get the dept you like if not you have a really rough time going from grocery to general merchandise. And the expectations are different and some times unrealistic.
good,"Worked 15hrs a day, HR management cares nothing about team. No work life balance..at all especially when you're in upper management."
good,The pay is very little and the expectations are high.  Lots of turnover in management.  No incentive to give more than you are paid to do.
good,My time at Wal Mart was very beneficial and an experience to remember. I was able to work at fast pace and assist as many customers as possible with their transaction.
good,Management tend not help associate only on rare occasions. There are friendly workers but some are lazy and do not do what they are suppose to do in their work environment. Hours are always being cut and the store never has enough employees to be on the registers and or help out customers.
good,they could give people more money per hour and also more hours and secure them wit benefits. I love shopping at walmart but just not working for the company big major difference
good,"Working directly with customers was the most enjoyable part of working there. I believe there was too much emphasis on speed while friendliness came in second. Handling that much money was exciting and nerve wracking. Of course dealing with customers you occasionally got an impolite person, but overall most people are nice. Most of my coworkers were friendly."
good,"A normal day for me in Wal-Mart was pretty much what you would expect from retail. Management was honestly bad, they showed no attentiveness toward customers at all, which in the long run created too many issues."
good,"Every day at work was another day to help customer, I learned how to clean up correctly and I really enjoyed interacting with the customers. The management was a little condescending as they would do things that they told other employees that they could not do. My co-workers were just like everywhere else, you have some that you liked, and others that did little work. The hardest part of the job was having to help so many stations throughout the store because of how under employed the store was. The only part of the job I enjoyed was that I got to work for the customers. They always told me thank you and that I did a great job."
good,"la gerencia abusa de su poder "
good,"My day starts out with a full tour of the stors checking with all the departments making sure every thing is going well."
good,"As the review summary says.. The bosses were simply horrible. They make it difficult to work in a somewhat decent job, The pay was okay and there were raises every so often depending on how well you maintained your work but the bosses simply RUIN the job. No matter what position, it was ruined."
good,"Go in and start assembling bikes, I've learned how to assemble a lot of furniture, bikes, & other toys. Management seems not to care about the employee, rather then just selling. A lot of my co-workers are lazy and don't do their jobs, but it may just be some stores. The hardest part of the job is just a lot of heavy lifting all day. I like to work with my hands and accomplish tasks."
good,A typical day in Walmart is cleaning around the register and making sure candy is stocked properly. I worked at the cash register and customer service desk. I typically would start off at the register by giving someone a break it is either one of their fifteen minute breaks or their lunch. My co workers were pretty cool and we had a lot of down time on certain shifts and also depending on the day of the week. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management and some of the customers. The customers could be rude at time depending on the amount of lines that were open.
good,Walmart has a fast paced work environment.  They expect you to complete multiple tasks in a very short period of time.  Expected you to know how to complete your task without direction.
good,I like the people i work with.  Sometimes the people i meet are interesting. Life is never the same at this job.  It is hard to move up for some people.  This place is not for everyone.  insurance is not the best.
good,"I started as a Auto Tech and worked my way up to a Loss Prevention"
good,The job of the assistant manager is harder than it looks. It is more than just walking around keeping an eye on people its also jumping in and doing the job. The job in the job description was not hard it was the upper management expecting way to much to complete for one person. Walmart likes to change things which doesn't make sense to hurt a certain shift all because they want to do it get product on the shelf. They go by an open door program but the open door program hardly works because everyone is in on the coaching when it is given.
good,"Typical day varied depending on where I was placed."
good,always busy.  From price changes to maintaining the meat selection. Worked with wonderful co-workers. We always felt like a family
good,Seems to be in a transitional period. The most enjoyable part of the job was working along side my colleagues and learning from them.
good,this place is very stressful and it does not pay overtime. They will make you take longer lunches to kill your overtime. Management is a joke and they abuse their workers to a large extent.
good,"Agradable ambiente laboral, aprendí a manejar clientes con muy poca disposición sabiendo levar la situación para que el cliente quede satisfecho."
good,I enjoy what I do at my current job. Being that this is a well known public place that people shop the work pace is fast and busy. The hardest part working at the store that I work at is having to deal the poor management there.
good,"Good Company for hourly supervisors, if you are management you do not have alot of down time with your family and friends."
good,"Standing in one place with only one job is to boring for me."
good,The associates who work at Walmart are very nice and the store is very short-handed.Everyone tries to help each other because it is so under staffed.
good,"Only really cares about making money, but if you can keep yourself motivated it's okay.  The company only really cares about making money, but there are incentives for keeping the profit up."
good,"Stable job but no chance for advancements. If you are a night shift associate you get over looked. They do not promote off of your work ethic, they promote off of friendships."
good,"Sometimes very difficult to work with the different boss's, but if you sit down to talk to them, you can better understand them and where they are coming from."
good,"Fast paced, with strong local ties to the community, Walmart is a great place to start a career in retail or customer service."
good,The job is exciting from the beginning of the shift until the work is complete. There is always something to do to improve the quality of the store for the shopper. The mangers do not micromanage the employees. The hardest part of the job is giving it your all for less than your effort is worth. The most enjoyable part of the job is the culture of the employees and the job itself is easy to catch on.
good,"I worked here while I was in my early years of college. It is a good company for someone like me who just needed to earn some money while working towards a college degree. I would not recommend making your career with Walmart. They are very flexible with school schedules and will work with you if you are in college. However, the management is kind of a joke. They make barely enough to get by, and act like it too. It's like working with a bunch of high school students. If you do your work, get along with everyone and just do enough to get by, then no one will bother you. However there is a lot of drama and the managers are just as bad as your coworkers and no one is going to take you seriously if you have an issue."
good,The hours were very good. However they just were not willing to work with my schedule. They had terrible communication skills.
good,"Had it's good and bad days.  Written up for everything it seemed.  Not just me but everyone.  Hard to get time off on days I needed, yet only worked part time.  Supervisor was great and tried to make a good work environment.  Worked mostly during the daytime hours."
good,It was good just a lot of favoritism. The CSM Where great but the upper management was poor. I always got lunch and I always got Paid for my hours. I Never got over time though and the hours where usually bad. only getting one day off a week.
good,"walmart doesnt care about their employees, the walmart i worked at the management was very unorganized, i really like working in lawn and garden so i wouldnt have to deal with the unorganized ways"
good,Work as a Customer Service Supervisor/Support Manager.  Lead associates in daily functions on sales floor.  Implement road map strategy plans for daily operations.
good,Can be  a fun place to work.  Management was supportive and willing to help you grow in the company.  Fair amount of politics.  The enjoyable part of the work was working with some of my colleagues.
good,"Con falta en calidad de Vida para sus empleados."
good,The co-workers are great. Putting stock away. Management was ok. I learned how to time manage thing's I do. The hardest part of the job was the freezer.
good,"Only worked there for a short period of time, and didn't really get trained the way that I felt I should have been. I got yelled at because I didn't know certain things, and no one had explained them to me, I never was told how to do my job the correct way, and they never had enough people working, so the freight was never finished."
good,My co-workers are great for the most part. There are some I would rather not work with. Typically we are busy and hardly get a break. Management always makes sure we get our 2 15 minute breaks and our lunch. The company would be better if they hired on full time and we were able to get benefits.
good,"Basicamente a cultura da empresa é tradicional. Sua missão é agregar competências e somar qualidade desenvolvendo trabalhos em equipe, com avaliações de desempenho e feedbacks formais para engajamento."
good,"I would come in for the day, check my department for holes and items that were out and put together a pick list and an order.  I would then help my team work on notes left from my supervisor while I waited for my picks to be ready to put away.  When my notes were completed I would then work on putting my picks away and filling my department.  When I was needed, I was also called up to check out customers and fill CSM position while they were having lunch breaks.  My job was a great way to interact with the customers and work side by side with other management and employees to get the jobs completed in a timely manner.  I learned a lot about organization and team work along the way.  With being able to multi task, there was a large variety of jobs to get accomplished each day."
good,"During a typical work day I assist customers with returning items, finding items throughout the store or direct them to the nearest store where it is available and assist in other places I'm needed. I enjoy working with my co-worker and my direct manager while making sure the customer is satisfied with their experience in our store. The hardest part of my job is making sure a angry customer walks out a happy customer."
good,Having a degree holds little to no value within this company.   One is better served to start early (and on the bottom) and to give it your all.
good,"I enjoyed my job on the floor because I feel like I was making a difference in the store. Each day was a little different and when I left I could see where what I did that day made the area neater, cleaner, and better for the customer. Cashiering is not the job for me however, and with some internal restructuring that wouldn't work with my life requirements, I had to go back to being a cashier and thus facilitated a need for me to look for something more fulfilling. I enjoyed customer interaction, stocking, maintaining a neat and clean work area, rotating the product to ensure freshness and keeping it relevant to the shopper. It's a lot of time on your feet, and can be a lot of heavy lifting, but it's not so bad if you are keeping moving."
good,Great start for kids out of school. Not much room for advancement. Management isn't always good. Horrible benefits. Horrible hours. Hard to manage a family while working there
good,"The job is repetitive and very physically demanding, which is good because you pick up how to do the job relatively quickly and it is quite the workout, however, it can become fairly strenuous and can get boring very quickly, which is a problem if you are not good at staying focused.  I was working overnights on a six-month contract at the cold storage facility, much like the majority of the people I was working with.  Competition was steep.  I can recall numerous occasions where another warehouse operator did not care for their surroundings as they were too focused on meeting or exceeding the expected quota, thus making it dangerous for the people around them.  A large number of those employees (myself included) did not get their contracts renewed.  In a typical eight hour shift, all you are doing is building pallets, shrink-wrapping them and placing them in to the wrap machine, and then you or a designated ""hauler"" drops them off to their assigned dock to be shipped to its respective store.  The first two weeks on the job are dedicated to training you on forklift operation, use of the equipment, and warehouse safety.  Compared to other warehouse jobs, the salary they give is probably one of the highest paying at around 19-20 dollars an hour."
good,"Go in... put freight away, Zone the area you work in. Sometimes get pulled to other areas of the store. help customers. co-workers there are amazing."
good,at walmart it is a very stressful work place and management is not always honest and easy to work with. they say that they will work with you on hours and never do. and it is a pick favorites work place.
good,"As far as a company to work for goes it's the typical workplace. I have great fellow co-workers and I have a pretty good management team. Full time associates get some good benefits. The every three month bonus is nice and helpful when we meet our mark. The hardest part of the job is when we are pulled for other things hindering us from finishing our tasks. Ex: Working in Apparel then getting pulled for register or to do a piercing. It is great to learn as much as you can for you will always be needed, but the more you know the more you're pulled for things. The most enjoyable part is the face of a happy customer once you have helped them find what they were looking for. In any job it's those smiling faces, kind words, sighs of relief, and friendly people that make any job well worth it."
good,"I feel like if you are going to succeed at a place of employment like Sams or Walmart then . Then they need a better shift leader skills . My area was given a shift leader that did not know how to handle day to day operations. This is including ordering products for area, managing said area , being able to count on your management and employees . Getting in trouble for following  management orders is a no, no . I cant not  tell you how it feels until someone works in that situation there selves  ."
good,Pretty fun workplace with great team players and some ok managers. Was in back most of shift. You'll become excellent at using a pallet jack/forklift.
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in at 1pm and finding the nearest supervisor in charge of the zoning team to figure out what part of the store i will be assigned to. I learned a lot, i wasn't just zoning or facing products i was getting social skills from working with customers and co-workers and this is a huge thing for me since I had bad public anxiety to the point I couldn't go anywhere without having someone tag along with me. I learned how to pull freight from the truck and sort it by departments and even pull the freight out once in a while. I learned how to handle hazmat products and how to take care and dispose of them."
good,"Fast paced working environment"
good,"Walmart is a enormous company with lots of red tape and politics. With 300 employees you'll always see fresh faces and new managers. Because of the high turn over rate the people being promoted struggle to learn all of their responsibilities and are tense with pressure to succeed or be replaced. The training on the job is done with multiple choice computer quizzes with the hands on experience being taught by the other associates and not by management. "
good,"when coming i had to set up the room for when the trucks come in "
good,"The overall Wal Mart work experience was a good one. I didn't necessarily enjoy the job, but then again who does? The management was not very understanding, and didn't really care about the associates or their issues."
good,"Stocking product and receiving product in the morning. Could not trust the co-workers, I like my job cause of the customers."
good,"Great company to work for, very flexible when it comes to home and family and school. Does give benefits to associates. However management is very lacking."
good,"work is extremely stressful, management runs excuse circles so they are never the ones to blame, management always works their fast pace workers like dogs and never gives them appreciation. never take responsibility to train their workers properly"
good,Working in the back room to ensure product binning accuracy and making sure that the products that needed to go onto the salesfloor were indeed available and sent out in a timely manner to be stocked.
good,The company it self is not a bad company. You have management that expects certain people to work like a superhero and other associates get to take it easy and that just doesn't seem right to me.
good,"Enjoyment through out the day meeting different coworkers and customers. Great bonuses, offered good health care for full time employees."
good,"Walked in to a over piled fiting room with coworkers just standing there, had to clean the area and answer the phones. I learned that mangement didnt pay enough attention to what the workers were doing. The hardest part of the ob was not giving orders when I was not management. Most enjoyable was helping the customers"
good,"A day at Walmart is pleasant with helping and assisting customers. Management was not too good but I can say the zone manager for the front end was very pleasant and respectful toward her employees. My experience at Walmart was mostly pleasant. I loved the customers but when it came to the managing jobs and the people that held it, some of them were VERY unpleasant to work with."
good,"The store I worked at was terrible, it had a reputation for being terrible.  Despite all of this I was still able to move up in the ranks."
good,"Well I got along with my coworkers real good, some of us became real good friends. Some days were long and hard especially when the cart machine had broke and me and my coworkers had to push 10 to 25 carts by hand in the blistering hot sun, but they supplied us with a cooler of ice and water bottles. Well the most enjoyable part for me was when me and my coworkers would talk, joke and, laugh with each other but at the same time getting our job done. It was always something to do that kept us busy."
good,"Help direct customers to area of need, answers any questions that customers may have, activate customers cell phones, clean designated areas"
good,"Everyday there was a goal for each department manager.  These goals would have been easily meet if each department manager was given the tools necessary for the jobs and the employees to get the job done.  Not only was there goals to be meet, but other managers would come and hand out extra tasks to be done, and pull employees and put them else where, leaving the department managers to do everything on their own.  The only enjoyable part of working at Walmart was having to deal with customers."
good,"clocked in waited for management for today's meeting, more demands then support and positiveness which i think was needed. unorganized. did more other work then the work titled to. overall fast pas work and working meeting all kinds of people helping customers everyday."
good,Walmart is not the best place to be employed while receiving an education. They are not as understanding as smaller businesses and does not give credit when it is due
good,"Era operador de caixa, gostava a equipe,e foi meu primeiro registro em carteira."
good,"But don't expect to get ahead working for these guys, at least if you're at the bottom of the food chain like I was. They'll also try to skimp out on benefits by hiring a surfeit of part time workers, but give them near full-time hours. (30+)"
good,"This is a great job if you like diversity and meeting new people and the work can be enjoyable, depending on the department you're working in. Being a cashier occasionally is o.k. but what I enjoyed most is being a salesfloor associate where I had the oppurtunity to help and meet the customers and I could get a good 'work-out'. I really enjoyed the freedom I felt out on the salesfloor."
good,Normal retail environment.  Lots of customer service and fellow employees that were not trained or did not care.  Long hours and lots of work.
good,"The best thing about working for walmart was the co-workers, they are the ones that made everything worth while."
good,"I work part time, I work my scheduled shifts, I assist with keeping shelves stocked and help cashier when needed,  I pick up extra shifts when I can."
good,All about the financial data. Who you know can get you promoted quickly. Is becoming more about the associates and understanding that with out the associates you can't take care of the customers. Bring back culture will take time.
good,"Mostly my day consumed of dealing with inventory and prices. "
good,Management is fun to work with. Easy going enviroment. Flexible hours and time off so you can spend time with family. Employees great to work with.
good,"i do the same route every day starting with cleaning of the restrooms sweeping floor that night shift left behind moped when needed i learned to do multiple jobs for pushing carts stocking milk unloading of trucks. Management was ok over all the colo-works was great to work with i,ve learn lot lot from them "
good,"The job was not all that bad. It just had a lot of favoritism. Management only promoted those they felt were friends, or "" kiss butt "" so to speak."
good,"Walmart was a good place to work. The pay was good, and my co-workers were fun. However, a faulty discipline system prevented me from advancing up for the nearly two years I worked for them, and my managers weren't exactly the best."
good,"I was with Walmart 5 yrs and have worked at 4 different stores. I love the Front ends fast pace, and customer interactions. Solving problems and also finishing all my duties required in our shifts while running cashiers change, makes the day go by so fast. Making sure everyones happy when they leave was our goal. We become like a little family and i enjoyed the time i worked there."
good,no toman en cuenta la estabilidad que debe de existir entre trabajo y caliudad de vida
good,Worked with some of the nicest people on 3rd shift. I think management could show a little more love to those people who are at the bottom. If you love working around people this job will grow on you. This is my 7th year.
good,A typical day at work would be to assist each customer to the best of your ability and to mention daily/weekly sales that were occurring.
good,"Typical day at work, sign in your register, handle transactions and rude customers, sometimes there are nice customers but uncommon. Coworkers were friendly, hardest part of the job was working during black friday/holidays. Most enjoyable part is I met a lot of people."
good,"I liked wal-mart for its work environment and compensation, It was fun to work there"
good,"Management was not supportive, was all about the money, couldn't grow, to much red tape for most of the employees, Guess that is how they feel they have to be to make money.  Employees never were given credit for anything, its a job."
good,"Most of my-coworkers were very rude, and never had respect for each other. Management never paid attention to the internal problems this caused, and they constantly put work off on an understaffed group when they knew very well we needed help. I never really enjoyed it here unless I was working with a customer, as customers never gave me a hard time."
good,"I was able to move to other departments and experience various aspects of the company. The ""family"" quality of the company is no longer valued and the assocaites are taken advantage of. Managers tend to cover each other's tracks and the pay scales are greatly unfair."
good,A lot of the work that had to be done at walmart was by what you thought should of gotten done. management gives little to no direction on what jobs and projects need to get done and on what time schedule.
good,"Working for Walmart was very productive, and a learning experience. A typical day at work was putting stock on shelves, hangers. Being a fill in cashier when needed.Management was there but seemed to not really care. other co workers said they were just there to collect a paycheck."
good,"I come in and I complete my daily tasks then I examine the store and see what else may require my direct attention. I have learned patience and humility since working for this company. Management is also pretty decent but I feel they could work on their communication towards each other and their associates. My co-workers are mostly helpful and pleasant and we truly do operate as a team when the correct channels of communication are followed. The hardest part of the job for me is wanting to come in to work because even though we are capable of being a great team, communication seldom exists and there is very little structure. In spite of all of this, a smile is put on my face every time I help someone and I might have improved the quality of their day."
good,"typically i would answer store phone calls for most of my shift. if i wasn't doing that i was out on the sales floor either maintaining the sales floor or helping customers. the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the variety of customers, my least favorite part of the job was the relationship between associate/supervisor/management. what i learned from this job is how to handle angry customers, and how to process inventory."
good,"Honestly? I look at my 7-8 years of retail exp with them and wonder if it was a waste. I want to do something else, but my resume has sooooooo many years with them. Advancement has never been about your length/experience with them, Its all about how much you are willing to give up for them mostly time. Do you want to advance ? Be willing to work more than the other people around you. "
good,"Es una buena empresa, las prestaciones que ofrecen son superiores a las de la ley, sin embargo la calidad de vida para el empleado en ocasiones pasa a segundo termino. El trabajo no se ve reflejado en la nómina, no pagan el tiempo extra. Si hay crecimiento en la empresa pero también es difícil."
good,"I was expected to do more than the company officially required including staying late, which led to the inability to do work on later days due to the fact that Wal-Mart does not allow overtime, though managers will ask to cut hours on later days, then blame employees for not getting the same amount of work done in the lesser amount of time."
good,"On a daily basis, I opened the photo lab and maintained the machines. I was also responsible for keeping supplies stocked and the machines in good working order. The photo lab was also responsible for online orders and helping customers with placing orders. Another part of my daily routine was working in the toy department, stocking toys and zoning/facing the department. My days were always busy and full of duties."
good,walmart was a good place to work . i learnd alot working there especially dealing with customers face to face and handling tough situations up close and personal. Management was fun to work with most of the time. i had great co workers and the hardest part of the job was the we didnt have enough people to handle the workload because management would schedule more people during the busiest time of the day. But we had fun .
good,Good place to work and good starting pay. Most of the Assistant Managers are really helpful and patient with the employees.
good,Management should learn how to compensate with regular employees.  Good place to work if you're in the right department.  It's always busy there so job security can be a pro.
good,Never had enough people. Never got the raises i deserverd. We were under paid for the job we did.The people were fun to work with we were like family and looked out for each other
good,"I mostly run a cash register.  But I like to learn new things, so I am often asked to do other jobs.  I have learned to work in layaway, the return desk, as a door greeter, answering multi (5) phone lines.  I have trained cashiers.  For the most part the managers, are wiling to listen to any concerns that you have.  My coworkers are easy to get along with, most of the time.  The hardest part of my job is watching customers steal from Walmart.  The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with people of all ages,"
good,"I honestly think there was alot of poor managerial skills, and because of this, they lose so many good, loyal, reliable associates. If you're  not vigilant on where you see your future, its very easy to get caught up in the secure feeling of having an ""Ok"" job with this company"
good,"You stay in a position for six months, weather you're medically able to or not.  I was being asked to lift heavy grocery packages and was putting my pregnancy at risk.  The management team was not very accommodating, and basically told me that I knew my limitations and that they could not honor a note from my physician advising me to not lift more than 20 lbs."
good,"As a cake decorator you have to work hard and know your trade. At Wal-Mart we were not respected in that manner. It takes time, detail, and energy. On one horrific weekend myself and the other cake decorator had 63 cakes to do."
good,"I worked for Walmart while I was in college and was promoted to department manager within a year. Because it is such a large company, management is sort of a mixed bag; a majority of my managers were pragmatic and personable, but I've had my fair share of one's with absolutely no people skills or personality. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers, who can be demanding at times. The best part of the job for me was working with a great group of people and making it an enjoyable place to work."
good,My typical days at Walmart was when every manager in the store was asking me to do everything for them when they seen I had two lines of customers that is waiting to seen. An d when every manager is going around the store and telling other Co workers that you are not do your job behind your back. You feel like you are doing a good job then management come around and tell you otherwise. You are so confused because you feel like you was doing a great job. Do to the facts that ever customer that came to your left the happy with what they come for. Any other business would say that the customer is always right. But not at Walmart! Walmarts Management do not care about their employees well being. For a example: Even though this actually happened. A customer of mines call in to work to talk to a manager and tell them that she could not come to work today because she broke her leg and now had to wear a cast on her leg. And management told her to come in anyway and she can work in around her area in a motor carts. I only enjoyed the customer because they was super friendly and they knew what they was looking for and they was not afraid to ask questions. Some of the co Workers there was cooler then others. So I made friends with a few of the co workers. But the others I let them go about there business.
good,"*typical day working tons of merchandise to the sales floor and helping customers"
good,"Primary customer service and telecommunications, enjoy life experiences, If you have a work issue you can always look to management for support, most difficult part of the job, making sure you always manage your time, micro management is a must. Most enjoyable part of the job, seeing the smile on a customers face."
good,"While a great company to work for, management tends to downgrade and undervalue employees. The people are great to work with, while sometimes being let-down with pay-raise promises that do not come through. The hardest part of the job is caring for your customers and trying to provide the best service management allows."
good,I honestly wouldn't wish any of my friends or family to work here. The management scale is based on family and small town relationships. They make you break your back and ask you to complete tasks way beyond yours or anyone else's ability.
good,Dealt with rude grouchy customers. Learned how to thrive in a position that required good customer service and pretty fast paced.
good,"It was a good place but poorly managed....managed to raise production levels and train two TLs,and I was let go with out cause"
good,The store was always clean and everyone was friendly.  Competing for sales with sister-stores kept us focused on customer service.
good,"Walmart is A Great Company , the only problem is the Pay!!!!! They dont pay you what you re worth and you do alot of hard work for the money you make. Walmart could be a great second Job. Thats why Turnover is so High at Walmart , They dont Compensate You Enough."
good,"I learned a lot of people skills and a lot of patience with working here. Not everything I have to say about them is bad, but I didn't have a great experience working here in the three short months that I did. "
good,WalMart was a great place to socialize with the other employees. The opportunities for advancement were good. Front line management was not always informative or supportive. I had to literally walk around to look for help from supervisors that were not busy for any type of assistance.
good,Great place to begin being a entry level optician. Provides day to day problems that require analysis and on the job solutions.
good,"I was a cashier in the hunting and fishing department. Welcomed and assisted customers, stocked shelves, cleaned and organized the department and warehouse area. My co-workers and I worked well together and learning the functions, the products and company expectation's was a experience well worth it,"
good,"My managers are good people. they support and guide you with every task and anything else you may need help with. overall, for working families it is a good place to work."
good,"I worked for Wal-Mart first as a maintenance associate, and as a Garden Center sales associate. I would not recommend working as a maintenance associate for those who are weak-stomached, or have more than a shred of dignity as you will be doing exactly what you think a maintenance associate would be doing. (Hint: You will be cleaning human feces on a daily basis.). The promotion to a garden center sales associate was a huge relief to me, and it is a much more dignifying job, that also pays more (which makes no sense to me). The management at Wal-Mart is perhaps the worst part of the job, and if you ever work there, you will find yourself avoiding them at all cost. It's odd to me that most of the management at Wal-Mart have started out as associates, yet they seem to know very little of the store's operation. You will find yourself making decisions that a manager should make, because they are incredibly unhelpful, or impossible to find."
good,"A typical day at Walmart wasn't typical compared to other jobs I had in the past , each day was a brand new day that all of my training and common sense  as well as  creativity were challenged . I thought that customer service was basically the same across the board in business. I was very wrong and I learned that for instance in the hospitality industry has nothing in common with retail customer except for great customer satisfaction, but the path to achieving that satisfaction requires a whole new set of rules for the end results. For the most part my management team was awesome and professional with a real open door policy as well as supportive . The hardest part of my job was when new management came in and cleaned house leaving my front of the store short of  staff that jeopardizes customer satisfaction and service. While I was never approached by upper management for unsatisfactory job performance , I was a little worried about my job security because of seeing very qualified employees terminated  that had dedicated their entire career to this company because of personality differences instead of job performance. The most enjoyable and rewarding part of my job was the opportunities for career advancement , continuous training opportunities , and a truly extensive choice of career advancement within this company."
good,"I don't know if it's like this at every Walmart but at MY particular Walmart the distribution center just floods us with freight every night. Some nights we get two trucks slammed full of everything in the store. We already have most of the items in the bins. We have no place to put the new freight. Management comes in during the day is upset with the overnight crew for not being able to bin the massive amount of new freight in the imaginary bin space. They accept no excuses because that's how upper management works. Everything is your fault as a lower manager. It's not that the DC sends too much stuff, it's overnight's fault for not finding somewhere to put it."
good,"its alright for people getting out of high school, and have no idea what they want to do with their life. Unload truck(s), pull palettes to the sales floor, assist customers with their questions about products.  My Management is always there to help me. The hardest part about my job is when my co-workers call off and have to theoretically be their muscle. The most enjoyable part of work is the end of the day."
good,"Working for Walmart wasn't all bad, in fact there were many great things about it, but overall, the micromanagement and belittlement by management each day drove many people to quit."
good,"Sorry--I'll have to write this review when I have more time."
good,"I was promised CSM position, Asset protection position and management never came through with promises. It was very boring standing in one spot for eight hours."
good,Worked in the Deli as a way to sore to upper management. Good workmates and supervisors. Management is too busy to see the details.
good,This is a huge place to work and it was an excellen learning opportunity. I worked in IT and there was a ton of overtime. They have a mandatory 9 hr workday. Great place overall.
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits."
good,The job was very simple to do but because of the lack of communication between managers it made it alot harder then it should have been
good,"The best thing about working at Walmart was that at the end of the day, my work was done. I took nothing home and brought nothing back."
good,it has its good and bad. dealing with the public is always an experience. .  you meet some nice people. things go better when everyone works .
good,"At Walmart you interact with great variety of people. very interracial. busy, busy and busy"
good,"This is a good place to work when you re trying to get through school or a hard time. Unless you are in management, wages are so so."
good,"Thsi was a great job, however, the managers change so often with out notice (every other week or so) that it becomes disorienting. This is mostly a problem becuase he new managers never seem to be quite confident enough to take charge as they are still learning about the employees and the store. By the time they gain the confidence they leave. "
good,They cant keep a store manager and the other managers don't communicate. Garden center is the best location just far enough from the chaos.
good,"Good place to start off your first job."
good,A typical day at work consisted of coming into work and having the management rush you through your work so that you could go and help other associates finish their work.
good,i was able to develop some good skills working here. Management is going from been ok to really bad. Its a decent place to work at if you're trying to work and go to school full time.
good,"My experience at Walmart was great because of my co-workers and the fast paced workdays. The management in my opinion however, could use some work. They usually do not listen to ideas of their workers and many were unapproachable. The pay was not as great as it should be for the amount of work the managers will force on their employees."
good,"Lots of opportunity to move up, decent job security, management is extremely hit or miss a good management team can making working fun but a bad can make it miserable. Plenty of time off once you've been there a year"
good,"Walmart is a very good company to work for. I loved working for Walmart but there comes a time when sometimes you have to make a decision if this is the right place for you to work at. I was a cashier there and I enjoyed my job however the management is not very understanding when it comes to issues or situations when customers are unhappy or very upset and a manager is not anywhere to be found unttil it is too late. unfortunately, I decided to move on to another company where managers work with their people and are usually there and present when ever you need a manager. Walmart has cut back the management team and they are no where to be found when you are a employee and you need their help. I give them a poor rating in management."
good,Management is great but it is long busy nights. lots of theft and drama.Most of management is nice and you can talk to them about anything.
good,"E uma empresa que da muita oportunidade de crescimento,cuida bem dos funcionarios nao atrasa pagamento e tc"
good,"Managers played the favorite card with some employees, wanted more out of the employees then what could realistically be done in a 8 hour period."
good,"I loved the department I was in, but they couldn't schedule enough associates to cover for breaks and could not manage to have support throughout the shift."
good,"A typical day at work was coming in, doing your job, enjoying the customers and coworkers, and living up to the managers expectations.  Walmart taught me that there are all kinds of people in this world.  Especially in Tifton!  The management in Walmart, to me, were a bit biased, uncaring, selfish, unfriendly, and power stricken.  They were probably the most difficult people to deal with on the job.  My coworkers were amazing to work with.  Although we didn't always see eye-to-eye, we still got our work done.  They were friendly, funny, down to earth, and just down right crazy(but in a good way).  The hardest part of the job was trying to get days off school activities that I had to attend.  Everything else was pretty much self explanatory.  The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers, getting to know them, and for me to see them when they returned and ask specifically for me."
good,"Learned a lot about student teaching with high school students, and developed core skills while working with adolescents."
good,"My supervisors were fair and easy to work with.  My fellow associates were fun to work with.  Learning the store layout and where everything was made shopping there much easier.  Helping a customer find what they were looking for was the best part, made us feel helpful in other ways than just putting merchandise on the shelves."
good,Great Place to attain retail experience. Fellow co-workers are very helpful in tutoring me in regards to the pharmacy business.
good,"Most of the employees were great to work with, it was mostly fast paced work environment. The random hours were not enjoyable."
good,"While the salary at Wal-mart was less than satisfactory, I was still pleased to find that Wal-mart has a vibrant work environment with many tasks to be completed, assuring that there is never a dull moment at work."
good,"As an employee of Wal-Mart, I've learned working for a large corporation you tend to get lost in the ""system."" You are not recognized by name, but by numbers. Most members of management do not even know your job duties. Communication on managements' part could use a little work as well."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart is a decent job to have, many would ask me if I could work there as a career and I would tell them No way. They would ask me why, I tell them because I am going places in my life and the management team don't know how to work around the Military. I'm really looking for a job that will work around the fact that I am in the Military. My co-workers that I work with up in the front end I enjoy a lot. They are super nice people and very helpful."
good,"Enjoyed the beginning of the process, was made into a section leader within a small period of time, but from then onwards it just didn't work any longer."
good,"Walmart was unwilling to work with me on stuff. I was hired on as a cashier and ended up getting assigned to cart duty on a regular basis. If i had known that i would start having multiple cart shifts a week i would have not taken the job. Overall, it was a great learning experience."
good,"I enjoyed this job and really liked the challenge of working in a fast paced environment.  The deli was always busy and the opportunity to meet and serve so many customers was rewarding.  "
good,"Walmart does not provide benefits to you if you work part-time, They think that you never have to be home for your family or with your family. They think that your life revolves around Wal-Mart 24/7. On your day off they may call you in to work for like 3-4 hours. I would not go in on my day off and within a week or two they were talking about how I would not come in. I had three small children and could not always go in when they thought that I should."
good,I enjoyed working with the staff and customers in a major way. I always was on time and ready to work with a great attitude. I always kept up with my freight ratio. If I had not stopped working to go to school I would still be a valued employee for the company.
good,"I've worked for the company for seven years and I enjoyed it overall. You just cant get much growth in the company. I understand that rules are made to keep everyone safe and on accord, but they make new rules up every week and some were not worth the trouble and were petty. Some of the managers were not for the employees. We had better floor supervisors than the head managers."
good,"On a typical day you warm up, have your morning meetings, then get to work nonstop."
good,"I loved talking and helping the customers with there concerns,"
good,"En el trabajo es llegar y hacer junta de comunicación para pasarnos los datos de ventas del día anterior y pendientes que quedaban del turno anterior."
good,"Walmart is a very well known company with a reputation for being a low price leader. Overall, the job requirements listed in the contract are straightforward, ranging from simple tasks such as ""must be able to run a cash register"" to ""assist customers""."
good,As a worker and a shopper of my place of employment my opinion is too heavy to give a decent review. Truly a job of showing better than explaining the extent of work for the amount of pay and respect.
good,"Listen Walmart employees are good people-the best, in fact, "
good,"I was a cashier at walmart but I also learn how to work customer service. So it was nice working there, Just management wise wasn't to nice"
good,"I clock in, provide customer service while I stock shelves, pull products to the front of the shelf to make them look presentable(zone). I've learned how to properly present myself to the customers especially when they have a complaint. The managers give me tasks to complete while I pursue my general occupation. Doing my job while providing customer service while doing tasks other managers want me to do. Making new friends through employees and customers."
good,The Wal-Mart i worked at made sure to keep the meat and seafood department understaffed and would say that they were trying to hire someone new but never did. Also they tried to push part time workers to do full time hours without giving them benefits of a full time.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart is a great experience. I believe I have learned more from working there than my previous job. When I started working there I had to learn new things on the register, using WIC cards, and using EBT cards. I also had to learn new things such as when we need something we have to put in action codes, blink our light, and wait for someone to come and assist my customer and I. After being a cashier I moved up to be a Sales Associate in which I still assisted customers, but I had to get merchandise for them such as TVs, games, laptops, etc. I had to learn how to activate phones and put out freight. I love working with the associates at Wal-Mart. Some days would be busy and other times it would be slow or steady. I believe the hardest part of the job is having to work in the electronics department by yourself until overnight associates came into work. I believe the enjoyable part is working with my customers and having customers giving my managers great compliments on how well I was able to help them with their problem."
good,"I was a great place to work cause i worked with nice people, had good lunch hours,  40+hrs guarantee it work with my schedule. The management team was terrible sleep on clock, curse at us , starting drama everyday, treated one better then the other. Our store mmanager Joanne was never there she was always at other store. Managers never follow company rules fired certain people for no reason. Management was rude some customers, the support management was terrible to. A hostile environment to work in"
good,"It was a typical experience. We came in at 4pm, unloaded the truck that was there for that day. After the merchandise was unloaded we brought it out to the floor and stocked in our assigned areas. Basicly that was our day. The hardest part of the day was having certain managers hounding us to hurry when we were almost always under staffed. I enjoyed stocking because it was a less hectic time of the day. When we are in the unloading phase, we are moving so fast we can hardly get a chance to think straight."
good,"Walmart was not a great company to work for as an associate, but it paid and I was able to cover the bills I do have. The associates were great, the customers were not, and the management was oblivious to most things going on in the store. The hardest part of the job was the monotony and the most enjoyable was working with great people."
good,"notes, customer service, friendly associates, equal opportunity, time management, self motivated, constant training of new procedures,"
good,I work here for about a year.  A typical day at work was to sign in and get to the assigned register and sign in on the cashier computer.  When I was not taking care of a customer I would be cleaning my station or I would help the Customer Service Manager stock the checkout lanes.  The management varied and it was not consistent.  The management was effective for the most part.  I got along great with the co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was keeping the customers happy and satisfied because I came across a lot of different people.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and how Wal-Mart gave us snacks in the break room and an occasional cookout.
good,walmart dont treat there employee's very good. Bad communication skills. I cleaned store and waxed floor and helped customers.
good,Good job decent pay. I would steam the seafood for the customers rotate the meat and seafood on the shelves. stocked the coolers and freezers. The best part of the job was helping the customers.
good,It would be a nice place to work if the management was better. A lot of favoritism happens at my store which makes me wanna to get another job.
good,I was able to improve my leadership skills through taking up more challenges. I also gained administrative and organizational skills with the capability to perform several tasks and planning.
good,Always had too much work and understaffed but expected to complete overnight tasks 100% and the time. Management took it easy all the time but quick to give a write up or verbal. Too much work to little pay.
good,"its a fine place to work"
good,"a typical day of work"
good,"working there was fun, but the management could have been better. He thought he knew it all and was not so nice to the people that worked for him. I was a cashier and I enjoyed the customers (except the ones who blame the cashier for everything) My co-workers were nice and friendly."
good,"The hardest part of the job is trying to get one thing done and having to much added while doing the one thing ."
good,"The warehouse supervisor was very arrogant and not easy to work with.  He was short tempered and had no respect for his co-workers.  He  was too selfish and only thought of making his workload light."
good,it would be so long because i worked overnight but my fellow co workers made it able to endure it would be ok for college students but for middle aged ppl they would need to find sumthin else
good,"Empresa  com grandes oportunidades referente  a  serviços fornecidos  ao clientes apos  a  mudança de bandeiras , isto provocou  perda de clientes e qualidades de aendimentos, como ponto positivo  a empresa  tem  um programa de cargo e carreira que  estimula  ao  funcionarios  ao crescimento na mesma"
good,"The job wasn't bad, management don't have any  communication with each other or employers very well. The job had its ups and downs from day to day. You get to experience so many new people."
good,"A difference in views and what is important in not maintaining a business, but grow a business make this a very difficult place to work and be happy."
good,A typical day at work consisted of taking payments and scanning items and working on my feet all day. I learned great customer service skills and handing registers and money at this job. The management there was excellent. My coworkers were some of the best that I could ask for. The hardest part of the job was not having enough hours there. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and talking to them everyday.
good,Working for Buffalo Wild Wings is a very easy job with an overall fun environment. If you stay there long enough you are bound to move up the corporate ladder....although you will be over worked and very under paid as a manger there.
good,"Aprendí todo lo relacionado con la administración de la tienda así como también el trabajo rudo en el piso de ventas, l trato al cliente, manejo de información de mayor prioridad."
good,"I greet customers, help them find what they need, sometimes answer phone calls and transfer to correct area. Also worked in the bakery and a sales associate and helped customers with cake orders, also made donuts and other baking goods. I learned to always have a smile on and greet the customers kindly even if they are rude because it makes the company look good and also shows I am not disrespectful. The management is okay at Walmart. Some of the team is good and others are very rude and do not care about personal needs even when having doctors notes or orders. Co-Workers are amazing I love being able to work with others it lets you meet new people and see how they work and also can help better them or yourself.  The hardest part of my job would have to be being able to keep a smile on my face even if I am being insulted or talked down upon. The most enjoyable part of my job would be meeting new people, making them smile, and also working hard for my own money."
good,"Very low pay and very low employee discount."
good,"I worked overnight, they kept me busy by putting me into 3 or 4 different departments every night, even with all of the customers that came into the store, they still expected you to get your work done on time or early. I didn't like the management because they didn't understand that you can't just walk away from a customer and ignore them.."
good,"Worked with electronics and customers, making sure the customers were able to find what they needed or looking for. Put all fright from the daily trucks in the correct places. Management needs to work on scheduling more employees during specific hours and days. I enjoyed working with the customers and knowing that they were able to find what they came for."
good,"I learned to appreciate customers, as well as, associates. I learned to not sweat the small stuff and how to persevere in difficult times."
good,"What makes Walmart a successful company is its associates, retail is tough place to work at to being with. This particular store has a lot of great well seasoned and professional associates that make it a great place to work at even though there are a lot of challenges from upper managements in regards to providing support at store level. But the store management tries their best to work with what resources they have. the customers are rather tough audience for the most part, can't really please them all specially in this market. "
good,"Loved the fellow workers, not happy to see where our store was headed with the new management. I was a department manager who was in control of in-stock and a team of associates."
good,"was manager electrics for total 6 years,did all the resets ordered for christmas ran a 3 million dollar dept for 2 years was a 5 million for 2 years also got employee of the month 3 times for my service over nights as support manager i had that title for 4 years as well as traveled 3 years doing super centers . this co went thru major changes durning my time with asst managers -they were the hardest in our store they gave us direction then after we completed the job (which we knew wasn""t right )the store manager would make us stay and redo the whole display the whole time listening to the asst say he told us to do it the other way -"
good,"Didn't really enjoy working here, management was very unorganized and showed a lot of preferences with employees."
good,Required to perform a variety of tasks. While most coworkers are good people management understaffs to cut costs and expect ten people to do the work of twenty on a nightly basis. Not open to new ideas but will continue to try and instate ideas that have failed in the past with no improvement on the way progress is made.
good,A regular work day is typical. constantly working incoming freight and helping customers in need. Stocking shelves and unloading incoming trucks. Co-workers are amazing and so is management great company to work for as a first job. the most enjoyable part of the job is speaking and interacting with customers and other co-workers
good,"I greeted people as they entered and left the store."
good,At Walmart you get to meet all kinds of people. It is a very enjoyable atmosphere and gives me a new outlook on life. The co-workers come in all different shapes. The best part about the job is the people.
good,Great pay but long hours. Good management but can be understaffed alot of the time. Holiday hours are extremely long but pay makes up for it.
good,"My days at work are overnights and I would like to get better pay and possibly a 4pm to 1230 am workday."
good,"punch in, get a cash draw, go to your register, login. then if it's slow maybe they will let you clean or put away returns. some of the co-workers are nice. the enjoyable part of the job is that I got to clean a lot. the hardest part was that was the holidays."
good,"A typical day I stocked and binned merchandise. I also helped with any customer service."
good,unprofessional work environment. Extremely understaffed which required cashiers to work unreasonable hours without overtime.
good,a typical day at work was a peacefull some days it would depend on it we got a truck or not. what I think I learned about working at Walmart is that if you cant work long hard hours then working there is not for you. Management at Walmart overall was good they were good managers they listened and was fair. My co-workers were good co-workers we all helped each other out. I would have to say the hardest part of my job was the nights we got a big truck. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work at night.
good,"The typical day at work was just like every day going in, and getting a register. Managers complaining about each other, and front end managers getting into trouble therefore the cashier is then in trouble."
good,"Quarterly raises with evaluations, benefits, holiday pay and bonuses, not too bad of a job. Managers don't seem to care too much, especially when it comes to scheduling around school and other jobs. Will almost always take the customer's side, even if you were following store policy."
good,"I work with customers as they are ready to check out of the store. Occasionally I would help with training new associates as cashiers. As a customer service associate I would help customers with returns, filling out applications for money transfers, payments, cashing checks, and answering multi-line telephone calls. I helped with inventory for a time categorizing socks and tagging apparel. I have money management skills, good customer service skills, time management skills and organizational skills."
good,"I am over operations. I deal daily with accounting paperwork, customer and associate issues. I have learned how to delegate, manage, hire, and terminate associates. My co-workers and I work well together. The hardest part of my job is being new and learning while leading. The most enjoyable part is making those around me feel valued and appreciated."
good,"A typical day at work starts with zoning groceries and then moving along to putting up pick carts throughout various sections of the store. I learned that Wal-mart is very much about team work and effort made by every associate, as well as management. I have the upmost respect to all the managers, however, I feel that better scheduling and company organization is desperately needed at said location. My co-workers are great, everyone gets along, and the meaning of teamwork is clearly understood. The hardest part of my job is not per say hard, but rather tedious at times when you're in groceries at the beginning of your said shift and working numerous carts in an unfamiliar area, which can take up some time, hence delaying you getting to your assigned area. The most enjoyable part of my job is tied in with the above said ""hardest part"", and reason being is that I feel much enjoyment when I get my area complete when there are such delays. I feel enjoyment and accomplished with a thorough and complete task, and the fact that I can assist someone or move into another said area."
good,"I was in charge of inventory, stocking and price changes for the dry groceries, candy snacks, beer and wine.  I also did product adjustments and modulars"
good,"I worked the 2-11pm shift, so I had the busy part of the day with people coming in after work.  I counted the money drawer when I arrived, took over the palm pilot and answered questions as they pop up.  I ran all over the store to all the cashiers no matter what department they were in.  I was responsible for making sure they all had money, paper and what ever other supplies they needed.  When it got too busy and there were 2 of us I would check out people at the registers."
good,"Falta pessoas qualificadas nos cargos de lideranças, sem comando e autonomia para quem esta na linha de frente"
good,"Long hours especially during the holiday season. Family is not the priority. I've learned time management and counseling associates that don't make enough money or have healthcare benefits. Being micromanaged from District and Regional levels shortens your life span and causes gray hair. Working for the world's largest retailer carries a lot of power to other companies that are recruiting you. You get a lot of experience in every way of life, from social work to retail and buget management."
good,you work tell your shift is over. They yell at you even thou you are doing you job. co-workers just did there own thing and didnt lisan to manigment then you would  get introuble for there mess up.
good,"A typical day at work was very busy and fast paced, having to interact with several customers and do several different transactions. Sometimes more than one transaction at one time."
good,Decent company to work for but not the best. expect scheduling issues and being on a skeleton crew.balancing life and work not too difficult but they don't offer set schedules but they will work with you if you have classes to attend just don't expect to get rich working there but take advantage of whatever training you can get it goes a long way.
good,"I cashed customers out, the people I worked with were nice and friendly, but I did not personally enjoy it I wanted to do something more with my life."
good,"I usually worked the closing shift which included closing down the deli meats case; cold, bulk salads case; and the hot foods case. I would also drain, filter, and clean the deep fryers. We had to hand wash any dishes used during the day, and the dishes that held the foods the various cases. We had to clean and sanitize the meat and cheese slicers, counters and working spaces, and the floors."
good,Everyday was hard. There was a new obstacle to overcome. I learn many things that I never thought that would. I learned that not everything is green when you want it to be. There were some co-workers who you could get along with and there were some who treated you like a non equal. The hardest part of the job was having management on you all day of every second you worked. Most enjoyable was starting to feel like a work family at times.
good,"There was almost always something to do, but once management left and all task were complete there was nothing to do. The co-workers were the most enjoyable part of working at Walmart."
good,"Everyday you are faced with the challenges of managing the critical operations of a 150 million dollar retail store. Everyday I have to make decisions that will affect the outcome of of sales, customer service, and re-stocking of the store."
good,"A typical day started with down stacking two to five pallets of freight and cashiering when needed, once down stacking was complete freight had to be stocked.Once freight was stocked it was time to Face up stock on shelves.Management was Fair . My co-workers were great to work with and always helpful.  The job was not particularly hard. I enjoyed the structure involved in the company."
good,I would be a greeter to people that came in and out of the store.  I also did the cashier.  One of the hardest parts of the job it was too far away from where I lived at.  The most part I enjoyed was when I had to leave because of situation that happen at home there were understanding to what happen.
good,"No two days are ever the same at Walmart.  This company definitely fosters team effort.  Enjoyable work, with incredible people."
good,"A typical day at work includes stocking shelves and maybe pulling freight onto the floor. I took the test for the managers position and passed, but never got offered a position. The hardest part of the job to me is working third shift with an hour lunch. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a manager comes up to me and thanks me for a nice job on the task that I just completed!"
good,Providing customer service. The management is unorganized. The co-workers are friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is learning to work in all areas with no training. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers.
good,"Time management, Constant nagging, Co-workers are good people, managers need improvement in communication, Horrible job training, When you get promoted they don't train you (the other associates do show you the ropes), Managers usually put the blame of other employees on you"
good,"work your butt off and get nothing in return"
good,"Wal-Mart helped me in many ways. Helped build communication skill dealing with the different customers daily. It also taught responsibility, having to complete some daily tasks. Great variety of people to interact with. Over all Wal-Mart has taught me to be a better peoples person."
good,"It was a good job for the time because I had to provide for my family and it gave me a chance to make some money.The workers were very nice to me and that's one thing that made the job better. I wouldn't want to work in this kind of field any more, i would like to do something more laid back but still productive."
good,Its Walmart and it was a job to have when i was younger but i did learn a lot about retail good learning experience. Managment was not great!
good,"great job but the managers was terrible, great people to work with. great learning experience. loved making the display products of the week"
good,"Great atmosphere in 2009, most of that welcoming feeling was absent when I left. Management refused to replace associates that leave/quit, thus those that stayed have a harder work load."
good,"A good place to work if you have a high work ethic. Very high paced, with reliable people to aid in assistance. A lot of the tasks are monotonous; although you work in different areas every day."
good,"I've worked at Walmart for over a year and it's exceeded my expectations as an employer. I was under the assumption my initial pay would be minimum wage but was pleasantly surprised it was well above that. Theres plenty of opportunity for advancement within the company in reasonable time frames. "
good,"The company puts more of a focus on what makes money and to a lesser degree, customers.  The actual employees do not always get the credit or respect they deserve."
good,this company is what you make it. as long as you come in a do your job and do it to the best of your ability you should be ok. they should be a little more understanding on attendance and understand that life happens and sometimes there is nothing you can do about it. family first.
good,"Typical Day at work: Wonderful if I didnt have to deal with my rude coworkers or management"
good,"I love what I do at my current job, it just a matter of paying rate."
good,Walmart is a great company to work for to gain the certain strengths you may need to use in your future. That's about it but the management can be sucky at times. Or all the time
good,"I had to unload and deliver all merchandise that came out the truck. Working with your co-workers is no problem at all, they will work with you. Most managers will work with you and few will be incredibly rude and highly disrespectful. No matter what the situation, all managers would take another managers side over an associate which was completely unfair. Besides that the job itself is fairly easy but repetitive."
good,I was happy at first working for Walmart but that has changed now. I gained all the experience I needed and really do appreciate working there and for all the oppertunities I was given but there is time for a change and my time is now.
good,Not a bad place to work. But it is not a place I would want to stay for too long. After about a year you are ready to leave and never come back.
good,"Wal-Mart has a lot of really wonderful opportunities, the only downfall is that they rarely give you more than 25 hour a week. As a struggling college student, that didn't pan out too well. I was fortunate to have been in the meat market department, but the managers always spread your workload around to different departments, even if yours was left unattended. The managers were often missing come evening, and they often asked you to stay an extra shift during school days.  For a college student this job was not ideal."
good,"en cuanto a la gerencia un poco distante a nosotros como asociados "
good,I learned many new skills while working here. met lots of people but pay was poor being that i have lots of retail experience
good,"understanding hard working co workers. management avoided associate mostly to watch us on camera, so we could never rely on them. very busy, but still able to get all work done mostly."
good,"A typical work day at Walmart was hectic. There is a lot of micro managing in that store. Everyone guides you differently. Co workers are okay. I learned a lot there regarding everything electronic with phone center and photo lab, I enjoyed being in my community"
good,This job has great benefits and other perks for the employees but the stress of the job every day leaves people wanting to leave the company.
good,"Loved the job, just didnt enjoy the management. i got 3 hours overtime and almost got fired, while the 2 guys that golf with some of the managers has 13 hours overtime and the other one has full time status with only 10 hours work each week. Almost considering working for them tho once they raise the wage, makes it worth the hassle."
good,"Busy department with a lot of opportunities to learn new areas and interact with several disciplines."
good,"Hard working associates, who will help their neighbor ( fellow associate) but they are underpaid and not appreciated."
good,"You can't really advance and you need to watch your back with both management and associates a lot of them want to just get ahead."
good,"Was good, nice people and supervisors, but is not a place to work for long time... They keep you on part-time for a long period of time, "
good,Walmart has its ups and downs like any other job. It was really a fast paced job but it was goo for learning and growing in retail. Patience is a big key in retail.
good,Lo positivo de trabajar en WM es que estas todos los días aprendiendo cosas nuevas y generalmente con las últimas novedades del mercado
good,fun place employees always friendly as well as management team greeted hello every day at work was always told I was doing a good job
good,"I helped the company out by making appointments, calling out people to make sure if they're still going to be available, I love to organize and that's what I did"
good,"A typical day was like overwhelm with work from the previous day.I learned no matter what the circumstance was my goal was to put the customer needs first. Management at times seem to be overwhelm and unorganized also, My co-workers seemed stressed.The hardest part of the job was being under staffed.The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing a happy satisfied customer."
good,The thing that I really enjoyed about working at Walmart is the many different people that I came in contact with on a daily basis. The management could have been a little better.
good,"Out of the 3 Wal-Marts I worked at the Wal-Mart in West Sunshine in Springfield, Missouri was the best managed"
good,"Stocked and cleaned shelves to ensure ready for customers. "
good,"The co-workers are there to help keep the day flowing. When frustrated, you are able to talk to them, in order to keep things from falling down. Most of the time it is a busy day, but there are times when there is nothing to do but walk around and wait. I do not have an enjoyable part of the job. As in any job, the management can either be good or bad, depending on the type of manager."
good,"As a janitor there, it was fairly demanding. Which didn't match the pay. I also stock shelfs, which wasn't part of my job."
good,"Walmart was my first cashier opportunity. I made customers' experience at the store more pleasant by greeting them in a warm, friendly manner, as well as engaging in conversation with them. I made sure they found every item seeked and performed transactions with no errors in exchanges. I also maintained a clean and safe working environment."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart provides the basic work environment in the costumer service field. Helping customers, stocking, straightening up, etc. In my experience there is not very much training with your appointed manager you are given tasks expected to accomplish said task, but are not given proper training on how it is expected to be done.  Wal-Mart does seem to have a very open door policy to who they hire have now raised their starting wage, and work with your choice of hours for your schedule."
good,"It is fast pace environment and expecting one to be on their feet 97% of the time. Due to so much budget cut within operating market, one was subjected to less workforce to maintain daily operation and as such salaried employees were use to buffer areas of shortcomings which made one overworked and demoralized."
good,"Walmart is a fast pace work environment. Managing people is a difficult job.  You have to have a stern hand, people will try to pull all kind of stuff over on you.  Had to put freight away in the freezer was the worst part of the job.  Working on holidays were not easy to deal with little ones at home.  Assigning job duties and then listening to the whining and I did that yesterday, its someone else's turn"
good,great company to work for. Job takes alot of your time when understaffed. It gets hard to deal with the customers but its apart of the job.
good,"Coming to work was not bad due to good co-workers and a pretty decent environment. I've learned to communicate and become more vocal throughout the process of this job. Management was rather complicated. Though I expect leadership from a manager, some confuse that leadership with direct and demanding commands. Some of which a lot of people would call inappropriate. My co-workers are the best part of my job because If any additional help that I couldn't understand, they provided exceptional information that helped me get thru any assignment at hand. The workload required is fairly implied on sum nights. There were a shortage of employees, so most work nights was rather tough. Additional help was not guaranteed so the task at hand was that much harder."
good,"This company was overall a decent place to work. Your team will listen to your concerns/ideas, and the management is flexible when unplanned issues/situations arise."
good,"Working at walmart was temporary, I used the time to do something different and get outside of the doors of my home. Over my course journey here I learned that I view my career preference in an office setting, and not in retail. It wasn't professional at all."
good,my typical day at work is assisting customers with their products needs. I learn about a range of electronic products and photo development.my coworkers were helpful in ensuring I knew where to find the correct information.
good,"Fast paced, crazy customers but they are very easy to handle, the associates and managers are nice and silly although. I enjoyed working here but work shifts are outrageously long but if that's what you need its perfect"
good,working for this company was always a pleasure though some management personnel were not what their job titles entailed
good,I learned that the training in these fast faced environments was marginal and very little empowerment of the employees.
good,"A typical day/night is a challenging task everyday."
good,"Great place to work as long as you get your job done. Managment needs to be switched around or watched more often, there is alot of favoritism in the company. As long as you keep to yourself and get your job done in a timely manor your good."
good,Very difficult place to work your way up the ladder. Things constantly broke and the management was corrupted. Very little communication between employees and management which made working there very difficult.
good,"punch in, work 2 hours, take 15 minute break, work another 2 hours have a 1 hour lunch break work  2 more hours another 15, work 3 more hours and clock out. I learned how to use their registers how to work a self checkout, how to handle cranky customers, and how to quickly give out change. My co-workers were nice but many high school students and got distracted and talked too much. the hardest part was that my managers wouldn't communicate well with each other so I was told to do things in a lot of different ways. The best part was talking to the customers when they were in a good mood."
good,"Productive workplace everyone work as a team at times. The only hardest part of the job I would say is learning how to count. Inventory isn't bad, it's just certain areas that require more time for no mistakes. I enjoyed working for RGIS, I learned more than I thought I know about working as a team."
good,"I have worked here for almost 10 years and it has been a mixed bag of emotions. One day the job can be easy and enjoyable and another day it can be miserable. Management needs to be trained more in interpersonal skills as they can be ruthless. I have tried to move up, but i have not been interviewed in either case. My co-workers have been the best part of the job as we provide motivation to each other when times are tough."
good,"There wasn't really a typical day of work in my honest opinion. It was more like attempting to do your best with all the chaos thrown at you. I didn't learn very much from the position I hold except how to use the cart pushing machine. Management is very easy to get along with and attempted to be as considerate and consistent as possible so long as you put in an honest day of work. My coworkers were very easy to get along with, very down to earth people, and just overall good at heart. It was rare to meet a coworker I did not get along with, but there were those few people who I would've rather not be scheduled with whether it was due to their work performance or how much they complained. The hardest part of my job was the fact that no one likes being a cart pusher and so as a result we'd get people coming and going not ever really lasting very long. The inconsistency of having fellow coworkers in my position combined with an inconsistent schedule made the job harder than it actually is. The most enjoyable part of my job was all the new people that I met and the overall mobility of my job. I was never in the same spot for too long. I liked being able to roam."
good,it wasn't enough pay to deal with the anxiety i was getting from one area manager.. she literally reigned terror but i do still stop back in to visit friends.
good,"llegar al trabajo saludar a los compañeros, checar tu tarjeta la hora de entrad tu hora de salida a comer tu llegada de comer, se aprende cosas nuevas cada día ya que es una empresa grande en la cual puedes participar para los logros de la empresa, ya que los logres te permite crecer tanto como persona y laboralmente. la gerencia es muy amable te saluda cordial mente y no son prepotentes, lo mas difícil el rol de turnos a pesar de ser auxiliar administrativo también rolamos turnos, lo que me gusta del trabajo es el ambiente laboral y los compañeros."
good,"As a customer, I shop there almost all the time.  As an employee, I was not impressed.  I learned a lot; how to properly pack a plastic bag without it breaking, customer service skills, and how to run a cash register.  Management all depended on the person and I must admit a few of them were not very good at what they do.  My co-workers were about the same, but I never let it bother me.  I just tried to do my job.  The hardest part about this job was the mistreatment I got from some people.  The most enjoyable part was being able to help where help was needed."
good,"The pay isn't all the great but good benefits and flexable scheduling."
good,"I stocked and priced fabrics from overnight, cleaned up the counter, assisted customers with matching their projects and helping them choose the right colors."
good,"Worked for Walmart for four years and found most of the management I worked with to be competent, professional and objective. The work environment is highly focused on short term objectives with a minimum of interest in developing their employees skill set."
good,Fast paced multitasking competitive environment customer focused effective communication Find solutions develop teams
good,"Typical days at works is unpredictable big loader or small loads depending on your manager. Learn how to work at a fast pace, management change often and get blamed for everything. Great co-worker young and old that helps out. the hardest part of the job is meeting production barely can take your breaks."
good,"By far, my co-workers are the best part of this position. Because of them, we are able to accomplish a great amount of work even when understaffed. It is because of my crew that I have learned determination can beat all odds."
good,can be overwhelming when multiple sales and ad match running along side each other. The constant new customer base keep the job from becoming to stagnant.
good,"- A typical Day at work is when it gets busy and we have to make sure to keep things organized."
good,Working night's doesn't give much time to have a life out of work. Co-workers and managers are nice for the most part but management begins to expect to much of you when you do extra day in and day out. They want you to pick up other people's slack.
good,"Check out customers at the cash register, have superior customer service, enjoy enacting with customers, I learned how to do customer service, I dislike routine, I like to make my customers smile and it makes me happy, I get along with my co-workers, customers say I am very pleasant"
good,Working at Walmart was quite enjoying. The store was very clean and set up neat . They make sure that everyone one of their employees get breaks at a good time.
good,"It's not been the worst job I've ever had, but it's not the greatest.  Be ready to work hard for very little recognition (and slightly above minimum wage)"
good,"A Typical Day at Walmart, would start out running because four or five other people called in. We ran short handed constantly. Which makes a Customer Service Manager quite busy. I was very easily transferred to money center or returns or put on a register because I am trained confidently in all areas. It was my job to make things run. No Matter what. No Stockman? ..No problem...I or another CSM would do it until we got one or found one from another area. The Management didn't want to hear your excuses, just results. So , It was stressful. But, it was a lot of fun if you had a good team of backups or flexible CSMs. Never a dull moment for sure."
good,"En general ofrece mucho en un principio pero con el tiempo va dejando mucho que desear, mas que nada en descisiones ejecutivas, los recortes de personal y la falta de compromiso para con la gente que se esfuerza. Igualmente los gerentes no ven mas alla de los resultados de venta y eso es un punto que se debe cuidar, las personas que integran la plantilla son los que hacen posible que ellos ganen y lamentablemente no lo ven asi."
good,"If you are a seasonal or temp, good luck getting anything out of the management. I had to call in because of gallbladder issues and they were not understanding at all."
good,"A empresa oferece oque tem de melhor em algumas situações! Não deixo aqui criticas mais sim o respeito, desejo deixa-la apenas pelo fato de querer buscar algo a mais."
good,it was good working there. but they started to cut my hours and wasnt making enough to support my self. nice company to work for but some of the managers were really mean to me and took advantage of me
good,They did not provide me with enough hours and it was not a steady consistent hours. They do not hire full time therefore I did not receive benefits.
good,Walmart is a sink or swim type of company. You must be strong to survive. There seems never enough time  to get the things done they want done. High stress level
good,"The people I work with in the pharmacy were some of the best people I've worked with, and the Pharmacist and pharmacy manger very nice and professional, the store manager was also very nice to work for."
good,depending on the day and time of month. can be a good job then again it can be your worst nightmare. the managers don't seem to care unless it benefits you. they use to be about family all it is about now is Walmart. if you have children please tell them not to get sick because they wont care. you have a 3 absence within 6 month period and if you go over those 3 you get wrote up.
good,"Ok to place to work at, management doesn't really care about your opinion on anything around the workplace and the customers always end up getting what they want even if you argue the point that its policy to turn down a request."
good,"I really enjoyed working here. Both management and co-workers were easy to get along with, and made a great team. I learned about time management and teamwork. I wish I could have stayed longer, but unfortunately I was only hired for seasonal."
good,"I'm conflicted about this store.  A lot is expected of the people who put a lot of effort into their jobs.  At the same time, management doesn't push the people who don't try very hard."
good,I worked at walmart  as a pharmacist when the pharmacies just opened so it was a pleasant pace to work in where I could keep up with all the work.  I enjoyed being able to work slowly and having time to help the customers.  Pharmacist hours were 9 or 10 hours when I worked which made for a nice balance with my home life.
good,"eu tinha que separa mercadorias e cologar em um pallet e depois strechar o pallet para nao cair as mercadorias."
good,"A typical night at this position was not good no matter how hard you work, how much you accomplish, you would almost always be criticized. Management did not listen to us nor did they care about what went on in the departments. The hardest part of the job was knowing no matter what when i got to work each night the day team had left a mess that I would no doubt get in trouble for ."
good,"I unloaded trucks, used walk behind hi-lows, and stocked shelves."
good,"Lack of staff, managers always seem to hate their jobs. All of the workers are just counting down the minutes until they go on break or go home."
good,"this is a great starter job for someone looking to get on their feet, students looking for extra cash or retirees looking for something to do. part time hours are offered with availability to pick up shifts in other depts."
good,"Walmart is a place that suitable for students and other dependants to work at. They do not pay enough, and their management team members are not well trained enough to lead others."
good,"Easy job being a cashier with little pay rate. Not enough to pay bills or rent. Management is fair, sometimes can be a little out of control. Co-workers are extremely friendly."
good,It's a fun environment to work in except for the time when there is a shortage of staff and long line ups. Great for a part time job. Co-workers are fun to work around and you get to meet some really great customers and at the same time some really rude ones which is pretty common in a retail environment.
good,It was stressful being young working at wal mart it really seemed as if they looked for things to give you write up's for. Day to day just trying to keep the job was tuff for me.
good,"Ensures a safe and clean environment by maintaining standards of safety, such as sweeping and mopping floors, emptying trash receptacles, and cleaning glass doors and windows at the front entrances and exits."
good,"Walmart is fine for high school/college students and retirees.  The store could have been much better as a whole. I feel the failings are not issues with the store itself, more along the lines of people on the upper end of the chain of command.  Observed people being punished for going over in hours for helping customers on few occasions and a lot of incidents like this."
good,"Never knowing when your shifts will change."
good,"I often worked at 5 AM at Walmart (South) stocking the dairy section. I also worked the late shift until 11 PM often. It was at this job that I learned how to use the mobile computer and the pallet jack. For the most part my coworkers were friendly and helpful, as were the managers. Unfortunately the schedule was a mess, and often times employees were booked to work until 11 PM, with a 5 AM shift booked the next day. The managers seemed overworked a lot of the time as well, and often seemed to have many problems to deal with. The hardest part about this job was memorizing were all the products were in the store so that I could accurately help customers with what they needed, but I got the hang of it. It might have been useful for it to have been included in the training though."
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart I had to set up the shift volume versus associates to meet goals.  I loved my job until the end and it was just a job that I came in and did.  There are many different genres of people and you have to learn how to adapt to the way other people are.  There was a lot of management turnover in the 13 years I was employed with Wal-mart.  I really had a lot of respect for my co workers and they had a lot for me.  Dealing with that one associate that you can never make happy.  The overall team work of the building was great.
good,Make sure if you work full time hours that's how its input into the system. They will have you working full time hours but code you part time so they do not have to provide benefits or qualify you to receive vacation pay.
good,"I spent my day helping set up lawn and garden, making sales, unloading freight, and helping customers find their merchandise."
good,"Write up service orders as they came in."
good,"fast paced work environment, helping others when needed making sure customers come first. Management has there moments when they work well with you. Never enough time to get jobs done that need to be done. The best time is when you get to spend time on breaks or lunch with coworkers"
good,"Contacted all Wal-Mart and Sam's Clubs to trouble shoot claims."
good,"I learned patience, caring, the importance of teamwork, and to make the most of each day. Most of the guys I work with are hard workers and have earned my respect and thanks. And the most enjoyable part of the job is the exercise. Management has recently changed a little bit but we have good managers. Lastly, a typical day at work consists of assessing the condition of the parking lot when I get there, signing in and doing my best to do my job well and help customers."
good,"I'm head cashier  in a Pharmacy that does over 500 prescriptions a day, I have several hundred customers I check out everyday. I know I need to be courteous to them and I am. Some of my co-workers are willing to help and some aren't ,which sometime that makes my day harder because most of my day's, I'm the  only cashier. I work every Sunday as Otc stocker. The most enjoyable part of my job are the customer's who are nice and friendly, and are more like friend's than customers."
good,"Job keep you busy, Great workers, a lot of opportunities to advance in the company"
good,I learned several things about retail while working at Walmart.
good,walked around the floor looking for thing to enjoyed my coworkers
good,Employees are great and the job is not too bad.  Lots of hard work.
good,"- working in two alternative shifts-7am to 3:30 pm or  from 3: 30 to 11 pm/ my schedule gives me mostly closing shifts "
good,I learned that Walmart doesn't pay enough to be able to live comfortably. Management were more or less idiots who in my opinion shouldn't even have held that position. My co-workers were the only saving grace to the job. To this day i am still friends with most of them. Hardest part of the job was doing things the Walmart way and not the right way. Most enjoyable part of the job was that it was the first job that i got paid enough to actually enjoy life a little.
good,"A typical day at work was attending customers, stocking deli cases, making sandwiches & salads, cleaning work area."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty hectic. Always running and new things to do. And being in 10 places at once. Kind of stressful.I learned that people helping people and working together can be fun. And gets the job done more efficiently. Management was tough. A million demands put on one person. But I still smiled and did my job. "
good,"Typically a typical day consists of coming in ready for anything. You start by filling prescriptions and clearing the troubleshoot along with inputting prescriptions and assisting customers as they come in. Everyday you learn something new such as the use of less common drug or the generic or brand name for a drug, I feel as though everyday is a learning and growing experience. Management has been interesting to say the least my boss is young and never been a manager her way of handling situations has caused a lot of tension between her and the stores manager. It has been interesting but I try not to allow it to affect how i do my job. My co-workers have had a lot of turn over in the last couple months we are currently in the process of training and in a pharmacy it is a long training period when you have never been in a pharmacy before. The hardest part of the Job is knowing that there is nothing I can do about the cost of some of these peoples medications and some of them are outrageously expensive. The most enjoyable part of my job is when i successfully am able to help a customer have a wonderful experience at th pharmacy."
good,"It was a job, nothing special. People who had been there for a while slacked off as usual and me being the newcomer I got thrown a lot of tasks for the sake of ""learning"" while those ""assisting"" me wandered off but it wasn't too hard just busy work for the most part. Cherish the moments you get to sit because standing, lifting and moving heavier things over 8 hours gets to be a lot on the back/knees."
good,well at the time this was a good company to work for  i would come in and nake sure everone was ready to work check to see if anyone need breaks and help were it need
good,"When you sign in the kiosk, the computer tells you where you will be working, or what register you will be working with; then do your job. You learn about people, the different moods they bring in the store with them and how to deal with them. You enjoy some and not others; sometimes you see their awful sides. I loved most of my co-workers, and as for management, I wish they cared more and tell you how you are doing in a constructive way. Everything was too general; in some areas they don't share at all. The hardest part of the job depends on your weaknesses. My most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly people who had a smile on their face and a kind word."
good,"After 14 years of working weekends and evenings, I am seeking a change.  The hardest part of my job at Sam's Club is working outside, at times, in extreme weather, and not able to take vacation during November or December, to be with family.  I have learned to work with many personalities over the years and enjoyed meeting many people and helping customers."
good,I have learned from previous experience that I come to work with a postive attitude and make every effort to get along with my co-workers.  I follow through on what assignments my management assigns to the best of my ability.  I get along well with most of my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job is that there is not a lot of communication between the management which makes it hard to met certain goals they expect.  I like most about my job is that I get to work with the customers and help find items in the store that they are looking for.
good,"You are expected to work to many days for low hours and low pay, it was very stressful at times with no support from managers. Would only recommend if you are single and no busy schedule."
good,"Attitude is a choice, and each day is a new day, not to be repeated or confused with the day before.  While working at Walmart, I learned to go to meet and welcome customers if given the chance. Keeping a clean, neat register environment was personally important to me.  Even though I've been a satisfied housewife with a husband that provided well, it is now time for me to return to the workplace and pull my weight, as he has come down with Parkinson's Disease and it is hard to live on a fixed ssa income.  Generally managers at Walmart were good people that wanted the best for the store, and a good reflection on their on efforts to excel in management. Give them the best you have, be honest and straightforward, and I found them to be reasonable managers for the most part.  Unfortunately, one morning my foot slipped on the old wooden stairs at home, and I plunged down the stairs suffering a really bad hip fracture. It has healed well and I definitely am ready to return to work and be the best cashier I can be."
good,Working for walmart was a consant negative experience with racial overtones from upper managment
good,"Un trabajo que al principio fue muy difícil por la falta de cooperación entre los empleados, pero aprendí que gracias a mis estrategias y sugerencias de mi área de servicio al cliente se pudo hacer mejor el trabajo logrando así un área de trabajo mas agradable y muy solidario, teniendo la oportunidad de ser nombrada encargada de servicios al cliente y ser reconocida por la gerencia de la empresa,y por mi compañeros."
good,"The work was hard and there was a lot of pressure to perform 110% every minute you were there,  the mid management team did all of the freight and made sure the sales floor was ready for customers."
good,"I enjoyed the actual jobs that I did at WalMart. I love organizing and maintaining inventory, so the Inventory Management team was a perfect fit for me. "
good,"it worked the photo lab"
good,"Walmart claims to really care about their associates, their well being, and individual situations, however it is not the case. They really are not as passionate and greatful for their employees as they claim to be."
good,my work schedule was not the best I was in high school going to work at 4 to 10 I couldn't arrange my schedule or pick my off days.
good,"Good company, rewarding for hard work but management changes to often and when sales are down they save money by firing employees."
good,I really liked the work hours and the people I worked with. The people in my department were fun and great to work with.I did learn a lot sometimes trial by fire. I learned how to be quick on my feet. I also learned to be more organized.
good,I was responsible for daily operations of inventory and customer service. I learned how to deal with issues involving customers as well as associates. The hardest part of the job was the ever-changing demands of  retail sales from yearly events to the monthly influx of customers. I enjoyed working with the public as well as my fellow associates and the daily interaction with all walks of life.
good,other than the terrible servive and poor hygiene kept thier the employees were really enjoyable to work with
good,"I realy enjoyed this job, everyday was something new to do and learn . the managers were nice and trained us fast and very well. i would work for walmart another day for sure. the envirmonet was comforable"
good,During my time at wal-mart I had the opportunity to gain experience in the retail business. I learned how to use the gemini/talzon to control inventory. I also gained experience in management.
good,"The low level management have no real management skills. They're terrified of the store manager, and do not support the associates. The human resources department do a good job of hiring the right people. I enjoyed my coworkers and providing service to customers."
good,"Through working at Walmart, I have gained a great deal of knowledge and experience of daily operations in the business.Having a great experience with one on one customer service and engaged in problem solving, also working with a team to get tasks done in the work place. I attempt to go above and beyond for customers and there return issues and exchanges at the same time answering phone calls. I am in control of money handling in customer service,  sending and troubleshooting Money Gram applications. I am confident i can make my customers happy and satisfied at the end of their experience, that their time was important."
good,"Walmart wasn't horrible to work for, but you had to make sure that you had to suck up to the right people and just hope they like you for any advancement."
good,"At some point or another most people have been employed by this company. I was a toys associate and as such most of my time was spent zoning and helping customers. I would be called to work in several other departments, most times without compensation or even simple gratification. Most every operating machine in the building needs to be updated, and usually there aren't enough devices to go around (i.e. palm pilots and Gemini's). Even so this company pleasantly hired me, worked around my school schedule, and treated me with respect most times."
good,"Some people can work at Walmart for years; what it takes to do that is ignoring the nonsense in the way the company is ran. There is an overall lack of communication and lack of hard working associates and some management. The good things about working for Walmart is that they are flexible with your school schedule and most managers are understanding to and emergencies, especially if you are a good worker. Working for Walmart is also a store by store experience. Every story differs, it all boils down to management. Having a few good managers on the whole team can't save the whole store. Co-workers like to talk, but are supportive, in most cases. Day to day experience is coming in hunting for a jack, telxon, printer, removing pallets of freight from the backroom area where i downstack pallets. after pallets are downstacked (usally 2 hour process depending on amount of freight) bakery pallets are taken to bakery freezer, meat pallets to meat freezer, and the remaining pallets for the three isles and one bunker that frozen team works are worked one at a time. There are usally 5-6 pallets to be worked at the end of breakdown process, and likely another pallet of picks coming to be worked. Severe overstocking of the shelves makes it difficult to throw new merchandise, but with time you figure it out. after stocking each pallet it is then binned into inventory in the backroom, frozen team usually has to do this for themselves because "" there aren't enough backroom associates"" to do it. But in reality there are , nobody likes working in the freezer so we often times take on extra responsibilities."
good,I was a cashier and then worked in customer service and returns and restocked the shelves
good,The hardest worker is the least likely to achieve advancement.
good,"I would come into work and clean the area, while helping customers with their problems or questions. There was usually a specific task assigned whether it be stocking, deep cleaning, or organizing an area. I worked in the electronic section so I learned a lot of information about tv's, computers, and software, along with phones."
good,"Great Place to work and to advance."
good,"Management did not support employees with rude, aggressive customers. Co-workers were not friendly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude, aggressive customers on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part was working in the Money Center."
good,Walmart was just a job that I undertook after graduating from High School. I wouldn't recommend working as a Cashier since the hours were very long which didn't leave time for a personal/social life.
good,A typical day at my job would be to check my task on the computer and fulfill the goals of the day which included putting out stock after that I would zone the area and put back returns. Sometimes I had to build special features and help assist customers in the store.
good,"walmart is not a bad place to work, Sometimes you feel like that if your not in a certain group that it becomes hard to advance even if you do work hard and follow all of the rules and guidlines"
good,"Walmart is a good company to start if you need a job badly. The pay is higher than minimum wage and is decent if you're just turned 18 and needing a job. The further I advanced in the company, the more I noticed the flaws in upper management and fairness in this work place. Extremely strict attendance policy. Flexible hours."
good,"this job had multiple employees on multiple shift to get vehicles done in a timely fashion. upper management would make huge changes to the shop schedule and leave us with no coverage at times. another manager would have to make overrides to our schedule which would end up with multiple employees being written up for working when not schedules, even though it was approved. I would be pulled away from job duties to assist in areas through out the store even though the shop needed me."
good,A good day  starts if the delivery trucks are on time.I may have to breakdown 2to6 pallets a day.I learned that managers work just as hard as associates do.I get along great with my co-workers.The hardest part of the job is working  on holidays.The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people and my company succeed.
good,I cannot speak for the company as a whole as I have only worked at one store.   While the pay and benefits are decent it feels as if employees and even store management are less able to make a change in the workplace than the store would try to have its employees believe.  Even among management one can find a feeling that every day will be more of the same.
good,"On a typical day on average. We would get a 2,000 piece truck, that would have to be unloaded within a 2 hour time frame. One thing that i loved about this job was the environment. It was really fast paced and hands on, just how i like it. the co workers were really cool as well."
good,i worked cash register. management is a joke. not enough hours. nothing enjoyable about this job at all.they usually pay more than min wage but it is way to busy with not enough registers open and not enough help. management is never around when you need them the only good thing was they are generous with breaks.
good,"Walmart is an exceptional job, for those looking to work full time in a very active work environment. Associates take an active interest in helping customers get what they need. Good job for anybody just looking for some work and good hours."
good,"The customers were really rude"
good,"I enjoy working there. but i believe i deserve better. its a fast pace, fun environment."
good,I came into this company with an open mind but unfortunately this career path is not for me.
good,"Strengthened company's business by leading implementation of merchandizing."
good,"Typical Day:"
good,"great co-workers, very little pay/benefits, Enjoyed working with people."
good,"Enjoyed working with co-workers and some of the management. Walmart does have good benefits, but they are not always true to their word."
good,"everyone just watched 2 out of the 10 people actually do their work, while they would act like they where doing theirs when in fact the other people where picking up the slack."
good,"My time there was not very good because I worked in the grocery section of the store and it was extremely understaffed. They would have 20 hours of work and divide it between 2 people for 8 hours. 3 people minimum was needed to get work done on time and that was a rarity."
good,"Pay isn't very good, but that should be expected.  The environment is pretty relaxed which is nice.  You hardly ever interact with the managers."
good,En todo momento cada persona cumpliendo su funcion pero siempre con respeto y explicando adonde apuntaban..Muy agotador al trabajar con publico ya que era un supermercado.. Siempre valorando los compañeros atentos en dar una mano..
good,I liked working for walmart its a great company to work for when you work hard and want to advance in the company they will give you the opportunity. Hard work does not get unnoticed at walmart.
good,"In my most recent job a typical day at work was very busy, I would deal with numerous people at Walmart. I learn how run a register Issue fishing hunting licenses, mix paint, make keys. I  also learned a lot about people and how to deal with patient as well as inpatient people. The management was OK understanding. My coworkers and myself worked very well together we handled the paint department, hardware, automotive, and sports department. aside from taking care "
good,"When I was a cashier at Walmart in Rochester, MN it was a great experience. The only problem was when I moved to Winona, MN for school. My day at work as a Jewelry Associate started with complaining about how much freight was racked up in the back and that we needed to get it all done that day. Keep in mind I was usually the only morning associate. My co-workers were amazing but the supervisors and ZMS were the complete opposite. They set unrealistic expectations and did not seem to reason with the fact that customers came first. The hardest part of my job was definitely balancing the customers over the work load. the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to successfully help customers and make a positive impact on my co-worker's day. Walmart is a good company to work for with good benefits; even for part-time. I would recommend it to someone who would be able to handle the emotional impact that the company can produce such as managers getting on you about getting things done when your supervisors are telling you to do the exact opposite."
good,"I worked here for a little over a year, and the supervisors were only working for the weekend. I almost hardly got any assistance from supervisors/managers when I couldn't figure something out, leaving me to have irregular performance. A regular day at work starts with unloading 2, sometimes 3, 72 foot Trailers filled with merchandise. The contents of the trailer when being handled individually, products weighed up to 70 lbs. After unloading we would use pallet jacks to pull freight to the floor. Afterwards, we would often pick items off of the back shelves and bring them to the floor. "
good,"I worked hard at this job for a year and a half. I did get a promotion to department manager and I was liked by a lot of the management. But, the training I received was subpar and I couldn't do the job effectively so I had to step down. I went back to cashiering which I was always good at and then I went to overnight stocker which I had mixed reviews about some management had no problem with me others did. I did enjoy making customers happy and smile. I had many of them seek me out and get in my line even if I had a long one."
good,"it was a decent place to work"
good,"M y co-workers at Walmart were very nice.  The management at Walmart do try to work with the employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the person in charge of hiring people.  When I got sent to that person that hires people and if the people have any questions on their benefits that are entitled to them because of the length of time working their, the person has no right to say the answer to the question two different ways, when that happened I went to the management to find out the truth,  then took a scheduled, approved vacation with it was supposed to be paid,  Instead I ended up getting over 100.00 shorted on my pay,  I got totally fed up and quit. That was the most hardest part of the job  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting a lot of different kinds of people."
good,"Walmart company is awesome, just lacking in proofreading management application. They are horrible and overly aggressive."
good,If I cannot say anything positive and nice then I don't want to say anything.
good,my time at Walmart was not that great doing something that a supervisor tells you to do and the next day you get fired that's not right. I learned good people working skills the management was ok my co-workers were all stuck up the hardest part of that job was the cash regester
good,"Can be fun at times, but also stressful ,management does not work together always ,I was doing two jobs at once most of the time ,I loved the customers and the other people I worked with very much ."
good,"A typical day is different in each department. My typical consisted of unlading several trucks, stocking shelves, and helping customers find exactly what they were looking for."
good,"Typical retail job, however, the pay is a bit more competitive than other retailers. If you're looking to work somewhere that will guarantee a lot of hours, and therefore, big paycheques relative to other retailers, then this is definitely the place to work. I always recommend it to students looking for a summer job, if they can put up with difficult customers and are fine sacrificing their evenings and weekends. "
good,"WalMart could be so much better as a whole. There is room for growth in this company, but the problem with these types of businesses is that the hardest worker gets paid the least amount; meanwhile, the highest paid employee is doing the least possible amount of work."
good,Its a great way to learn on how to help service your community and learn of what they may expect from you as service. The hardest is the in balance of the times you may work for example you may work two pm to eleven pm then work the next day seven am to four pm the next day. The most enjoyable part is meeting and assisting different people in your community.
good,"A typical day we would meet in the conference room to discuss what we needed to do for that night. I would have multiple departments to cover in a single night. I was given multiple tasks outside of being a normal overnight associate. "
good,"-Sales Associate: I would have to fill the shelves of merchandise, and to make sure that the correct merchandise was in its correct placement with the right amount on the shelf without over filling the shelf. I would help and assist any customer that had any questions or concerns regarding associate or merchandise. I had to keep up with housekeeping duties such as picking up trash and cleaning up any messes that has been spotted that was hazardous to not only the associates and customers. To keep a neat and clean place where it was not hard for the customer to find the correct merchandise."
good,"It had it's ups and downs but I was working 36+ hours a week, they barely wanted to work with me for school. They have unrealistic expectations of their workers."
good,Walmart is steady work and sometimes fun to work there. Some of the managers are not kind to employees and even in some cases customers. Not a good place if your looking to climb your way up in the company any time soon.
good,"1. Loading and unloading trucks. stocking and rearranging store shelves and areas for selling needs."
good,"Process frieght  , take fright to the floor and put it out , Get assoicates on task for the day. Check for price changes , inventory needs , Put stock where it belonges , change freight up for new freight coming to the floor . The hardest thing about my job is keeping things orginized women can really tear up a department in just mins. My favorite things are when you help someone find that perfect outfit for an event they have . Setting up the new clothes that came in ."
good,the only way to move up in this company is to be a lone wolf and cut throght attitude
good,"no management leadership take stock out, put it back, never any headway made."
good,No communication of schedule until last minute.  Floated between 6 stores and customers are horrible.
good,Managing the Buyers and it was an fun team to work with and for!
good,"I love the culture in Wal-Mart as you can see it may be the best quality at this current establishment. The customers are the best part, only because the store is not organized or staffed correctly so it is hard on those of us who honor punctuality in the work environment. I am noticeably available to any opportunity for advancement because I am looked over in a environment,there are so many tasks unfilled. I am interested in assisting wal-mart new store improvement but i am only one person and this can not be allotted for me only own."
good,A typical day at work at Wal-Mart was not enjoyable as I would clock in and head to the back to manage the inventory trucks. I learned that not everyone is cut out for a job in inventory management as a lot of people did not do well in the position. Management was very poor at the establishment. The hardest part was going every day with back and forth talking and less working. The most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out.
good,it provide opportunity for advancement. provide grants for school
good,not a bad place to work when it comes to hard work and good co-workers managers aren't very good though
good,Comfortable place to work but there is barely any room for advancement. Not enough employees to carry the work load. To much work put on a single employee.
good,Over worked and under paid. Management doesn't pull their weight and they cut hours a lot.
good,Worked closing most of the time . would have to clean fryers and cold and hot cases.
good,"Management is not very understanding. Its a nice job for someone who does not have bills to pay at the beginning of the month. I was not able to relocate until I was employed for 6 months,"
good,A typical day of work is doing back go backs left behind from customers and other associates. Management is fun to work with. Such a great environment with awesome co-workers. Hardest part of the job is rough customers. Most enjoyment of the job is my coworkers.
good,Great first Job.learned how to drive a forklift and how to place orders for shipping and receiving.
good,working here takes a special type of person. definitly need to be a people person as not only are you interacting with weird walmart customers you will also work directly with their employees that are just as weird.
good,"Daily job duties included running Distribution Breakpack, RSR, and building displays for all stores in the area we serviced."
good,"A typical day at work is  fun,but at the same-time hard. What I learned at this job is great customer service skills and Receiving and inventory skills.My coworkers were my friends we got a lot accomplished."
good,"Wal-Mart was a hard place to work with the type of people that they would employ.  Working with the public was not always good but it was a job. There would be a lot of people stealing there, so you had to watch out for that."
good,This for me was a summer job and that was all. I enjoyed working where I did but it wasn't something I would do all the time
good,"Working as a cart associate in Texas, was very hot! Failed to receive proper training."
good,"Some days good and some bad."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of being pulled to whatever department they needed me in. We were severely understaffed and our management team did little to nothing to help; they simply moved people around to different areas of the store in which they had never been trained. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the stress of my employer not being flexible with my college schedule. I was, and am still currently, a full time college student. My employer still insisted on working me over 40 hours per week. The most enjoyable part of my job was the bond I had with my coworkers."
good,Got to work at 1050. started working at 11. the hardest part was getting the materials and food out on the floor from the back.
good,"Go to work at 10 when I'm due! Ive learned that customers are the most important part of retail if there happy your sales are most likely go be good,because they like the service so they will return. I have the best coworkers i get along with them all if they need help they come to me. There isn't one thing hard about working at walmart all the we lack employees the job still gets done!"
good,"Review about working at this company, to tell you about a typical day at work, what I learned, management, coworkers, hardest part of my job and the most enjoyable."
good,Got to meet new people see old ones that came back to stay at the hotel during football season year after year
good,A good place for people who loves superstores. Great deals on many products and nice people. the hardest thing is to keep up with their time to complete your task.
good,"Walmart, me formo profesionalmente"
good,everyday we unload trucks. we may have 1 or 2 trucks a day sometimes 3. with a full crew we can get things done but sometimes or I should say most of the time were short staffed. overall I loved this job but it was the pay that I couldn't stand.
good,"empresa do varejo e muito corrido,aprendi tesoureira  processos como fechamento de contas,o mais difícil foi auditar o fundo fixo era muita moeda e dinheiro pra conta com muita atenção este era o foco principal atenção,mais o dia a dia corrido era prazeroso no final,pois o dia passava rápido e tínhamos a satisfação de realização de dever cumprindo."
good,"I started as a cashier in the garden center."
good,I didn't really enjoy working here too much. The hours were stressful and I wasn't getting paid enough for the type of work I was doing.
good,I learned that you have to adapt to the ever changing instructions and around the holiday time. There are good people there and management also. The hardest part of the job was the work load that had to be done in a short amount of time. I enjoyed working as a team.
good,"Could be a good place to work if management knew what they were doing, Perhaps another store location would be better than this one was"
good,"Its an interesting place to work.  Especially working overnight,."
good,Every shift was the same and self explanatory. I learned how to become more quicker in checking out customers in a well organized manner.
good,Very busy and very steady with a heavy work load.  I learned that customer service is number one on any job.  My co-workers were very loyal and encouraging.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to assist the customers to the best of my ability.  The most enjoyable part was being able to provide good customer service.
good,"Wal Mart allowed Dept. Managers the flexibility to do merchandise set ups for profit and loss. Trained me how to run stock in the back room, so there was never to much on hand. How to set up and read spread sheets for day, month and year inventory."
good,"Its good for students. Its hard work, for little benefits. Your co-workers are very different from you. Management is good and bad."
good,"I was in charge of the unloading crew, which would unload the gm trucks and stock freight to the sales floor. I would have 30 + people in rotation. I was also a rising star and planned on going into the management program."
good,"I like working at Wal Mart but they started cheating me out of hours on my checks, I would work 32 hours and only get paid for 20. My hours have been cut so that I am no longer able to work 40 hours a week. The 3rd shift management are nice and sometimes easy to talk too, my co-workers are nice or most of them anyway. I love being able to meet new people."
good,"job duties standard for type of work, management supportive,"
good,Service desk is usually a stressful job but I got lucky in the fact that the people I work with are great. My managers are great too.
good,"I am a pharmacy cashier, answer phone calls, handle large transactions and stock pharmacy items."
good,There are not enough staff members to meet customer demand which creates low morale and high turnover due to burnout.
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to work if you are looking to to be there temporarily, unless you plan to be a ""lifer"" and raise up the corporate chain. The people you work with are normally nice and easy going but there is a disconnect with management through lack of communication. There are also too many levels of management which makes it often difficult to do your job correctly if you are above a cashier level."
good,Made salads and sandwiches to sell. Cut cheese and meats for customers. Cooked and kept the buffet stocked. Pulled freight and put it away witch I really found to be one of the fun parts of the job. Worked with a few girls that were a lot of fun.
good,"I loved the management that I worked with, they always worked with my availability and understood family issues. The hours were scarce and the pay is not worth what you have to put up with from some of the customers."
good,They need better upper management most other workers and lower management is great
good,like I said before...A job is better then no job.....thats all I have to say about walmart
good,"doesn't pay much but easy work, customers can be a pain, managers don't use requested days off when making the schedule so you always have to ask again after the schedule is wrote, and part time with full time hours but no benefits. and lunches and breaks are never on time"
good,I like the people I work with and enjoy helping customers. Most of my work is making sure the sales floor in my area is neat and orderly. Also put out new freight when needed.
good,"Working overnights was busy from beginning to end. Making sure all the new freight went out and worked and overstock being binned."
good,team work in the cash office with co worker to get job done fast
good,"My typical day would include rotating stock and throwing away out dates, completing customers orders while having enough time in the work day to replenish the back stock of cake, cupcakes, and cookies. Then at the end of the work shift, I allow myself enough time to complete a full inventory and to clean up y work space. "
good,"Walmart is a pretty decent place to work, it's not at all as bad as people are led to believe. Management was really nice, and other co-workers were more than happy to assist you if you needed any assistance in lifting."
good,"Reviewing area, assessing merchandise, making a detailed ""do list"" for department."
good,"To keep the low price of Walmart, your work should be paid less. It's very simple game. They don't need any smart people but who can follow the orders as they are. If you are creative, it's not for you."
good,A typical day a work for me can be stress able more days then others. They expect more out of some than others
good,"What I have learned: I learned how to properly display produce, how to check what food is good/bad, what items are sold by pound and by each. How to properly store produce on the back room, and how to trim produce. "
good,Overall walmart was not a bad place to work. People where friendly environment was relaxed. Though their is no true room for me to grow and expand to what I want out of life their anymore
good,"It wasn't a bad job to have . The manager really worked with me to get  the best possible schedule that worked not only for me , but for the company as well."
good,"Walmart is a company that you can move up on the career field, only if you have the motivation to. It's been an interesting experience on which I've seen ideas on how to improve the store I work at, but they have been looked away. Customers stealing items on a daily basis to only return them for in store credit, regardless of knowing that they stole the items to begin with. The store has no security which is the major downfall for the store to allow anyone to take whatever they please."
good,Poor communication throughout the store and little follow up or accountability.
good,"The company is, overall, not the best to work for. While the job duties are not problematic, the leadership leaves much to be desired."
good,"Working for Wal-Mart was job, not enjoyable, nor was it a despairing position, just a job. the management was not very concerned with showing appreciation or possible advancements."
good,"Drive around building to see if detail needs to be set. Start walking the store for what the priority's is going to be for the day. Then make plans to get plans accomplish. Check for sales, scorecards. Giving notes out, make sure management and ZM's understand the priority's for the day to get accomplish. Then have a morning meeting to let associates know, how sales are and where we stand on plans and freight to get done, shelf's have to be full for the customers to shop. Scanning  outs and lows, to get the freight in for the customers. What we are needing to hire for.  Checking for modular that need to be done to get the freight done and what is needed for the next plan. Checking on the office's, if there is any problems that need to be address. Doing paperwork mark ups and mark down. Checking where we are at on inventory and shrink. Walking the floor for coaching by walking around. Touring areas for improvement. Following up on notes. Making sure we are clean around the store. Making the decisions to move associates around to get the priority's done. Checking emails to see if anything needs to be turn in to the market. Following the routine. on meetings, walks. Teach and train where every I am  at in the store in any area. Learn a new thing everyday financials, shrink, compliance, programs. My management team is hard works and will help each other out on anything they are doing. Its nice to see the dedication from the associates. The hardest part of the job is know what the other part of my up management is doing the communication on what is going on in the store could be"
good,"I worked as an overnight associate at Walmart."
good,"Walmart is not a terrible place to work. There IS opportunity for advancement; it can just be hard to find sometimes. The key to enjoying working at Walmart is to have a reliable team of co-workers/management. I absolutely loved my management team and most of my co-workers. However, with Walmart's high turn-over rate, we rarely had enough people to cover every job. So, for minimum wage-type work.. you sometimes had to do several peoples' jobs. "
good,"Everyday was the same thing just stocking boxes. Management was really bad, poor communication skills and lack of understanding. My co-workers were the best part of the job. The hardest part of the job was working with out the proper equipment and employees."
good,I enjoy working as a technician in my location we are a busy moving pharmacy and we get to see a lot of people.  The staff i work with is awesome and so are my bosses
good,"Delegated responsibilities "
good,The hardest part of my job is to stay focused. The nature of the job past paced and you cannot possibly plan for every event in a given work day. I do for the most very much enjoy the associates I work with and feel very productive and creative within the department. The most enjoyable part of my job is working on a team to better the consumers shopping experience.
good,Productive and busy work place. Managers was helpful when needed. The most enjoyable part about Wal Mart was the customers.
good,"worked with the public kept busy stocking, helping customers."
good,"Walmart is a Company driven for changes, They care a little about their hourly associates and absolutely nothing about the Management team. The most enjoyable part of the job is you get to work with people,and take care of your customers. You need to be self driven so you can give of yourselves to teach and train others."
good,"To be concise, working as an associate wasn't bad at all. You were kept busy and the work varied enough to not get monotonous. Being a department manager entailed a lot of politics, nepotism, and interpreting management's contradicting policies and orders (such as not having any overtime but not being allowed to leave until your area is done, with no leeway given for extenuating circumstances). Ultimately, if you've not already been there for years, or you're not planning to climb the management ladder, working for WalMart should just be a hold over until something better comes along."
good,"A typical nights starts off with team meeting then swiping my badge to see the task assigned to me either picking inventory from back, stocking on the  sales floor or cashier. Complete all task until nights is over. Worked under close supervision every so often assistant manager checks to see how far are we with completing our task. Friendly co workers very helpful with working together to complete a common goal. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting customers."
good,I.ve met some really good people there . Just feel it's time for a change .
good,"There has been only a few times where the work-day was perfect."
good,I have learned how to reset shelves and using different devices such as a price gun and a telzon.
good,"I learned how to operate a cash register with all the bonus things."
good,A typical day was filing but always remembering that its not always about the name of the employee for the filing but what event happened to have a workmans compensation claim.
good,Could be a great job if you are placed in a good store.  Some stores are absolutely awful to work in.
good,"While Walmart is a great place to work compared to other entry level positions like fast food, it is not a very good job in the way of supporting you or anyone else realistically. The expectations of the management team far out weight the pay and the outlook for any sincere advancement is limited compared to many other careers."
good,"The Job in and of its self is not bad but management needs drastic improvement. There is a saying, ""too many chiefs and not enough indians"" there is a lack of communication between all the ""chiefs"" which leads to a lot of confusion. management is really hard on the staff and it is not a very friendly environment. There are issues within the company when it comes to folks with disabilities, there is a lot of harassment form management on people with disabilities."
good,"I've been working at Walmart for almost 3 months now. I used to come in, bouncy and chipper, with a smile on my face and a go-to attitude to help the customers in any way I can. Now, I was hired to work in the garden department, but then without my agreement, I've been switched to the  toy department. I used to wok at Toys R Us during the holidays and that alone was a pain but working at Walmart during off-season is worst. I have 3 Hispanic ladies who are assistant managers toss me back and forth between zoning and go-backs. Now you all know what those are. Zoning is going up and down the aisles, making sure everything is nice and neat and taking out things that don't belong in the toy aisle. Go-backs are taking toys from the customer service department and putting them back where their homes are. I work alone in the massive toy department and I swear, I'm not making this up nor am I exaggerating. I don't mind working toys. I kinda play with them a little when no one is around to amuse myself and keep myself from crawling in the corner and crying from the stress the ""managers' are putting on me. I get along with my co-workers just fine and a few of the department managers. I am called on register 3-4 times a day, which is fine. But I end up skipping out on my last 15 minute breaks to try and please these managers. Then I get in trouble or chewed out if the department doesn't meet their standards..."
good,stayed busy from the time you clocked in till the time you clocked out.
good,me gustaba mucho trabajar en equipo y realizar distintas exhibiciones
good,Its a good short-term job. Has plenty of good health benefits.
good,My day consisted of pulling freight to the sales floor and stocking the shelves to meet company standards.  Interaction with the customers was priority and my number one goal was to ensure they had a positive shopping experience.  I enjoyed the fast paced work environment and the fact I was able to multitask consistently.
good,"coming in at around 11:00pm and clocking in. before each work night all departments would meet with our overnight supervisor to discuss plans for the day. and then shortly after get down to business."
good,Hard and very stressful job. Have to be on the go and make no accidents are mistakes.
good,"Very long, late breaks or lunches. Most enjoyable interacting with different types of people."
good,The other workers seemed to not get much work done and weren't very nice towards one another or customers. The managment was alight. Though they had favorites at the job. Most time managers didnt seems to know what they were even doing.
good,"the management needed to work on their organizational skills, no communication, and just not a company to work for."
good,loved my employees but hated how my managers treated myself and others
good,"I made subs and salads as they were needed and helped unload the trucks when they came in. I down stacked pallets and pushed freight as it was needed I also made sure that the deli was up to code, such as doing the daily cleaning floors, sinks, rottisurie, drains, and counters. Kay chemical always gave me green after my cleaning."
good,"Co-workers vary, some are very supportive and work with me, others blame the hard working ones for their slack that doesn't get picked up. Mostly a matter of young vs. old."
good,"A typical day started at 10:00 pm and ended at between 7 and 8:00 am. I learned how to use a pallet jack, how to read the codes on the boxes and shelves, product and quality control. I learned how to work together when it came to certain things. Co-workers were rude when you went on break, lots of comments were made about each other. Hardest part of the job is when you're given 25 hours of work and by yourself for 8 hours. The most enjoyable part was getting everything done and zoning your area."
good,"Mostly, It is pretty simple but that depends on your job position. Sometimes it can be very stressful dealing with angry customers or pushy customers. The managers seem to want you in five different places at once so that is no fun. Most of the employees I met there seemed nice and energetic."
good,"having a nine to five job sounds great, but you never knew what you were walking into. you could plan your shifts out in advance, but most often you could never complete your tasks in a timely manner because your supervisors would pull you from your primary job functions to complete other tasks through out the store, but still expect you to have your work done by the end of the day. "
good,This job was okay most of your problems come from customers and not management. Although Management can sometime not be very much help. Other co-workers are very friendly and its almost like a family.
good,"-National Certified Food Safety Manager"
good,"Compensation is fair, I did not feel that I was overworked hours wise. The scope, size, of things that you do is very impressive."
good,"The only negative things being a associate at walmart is the schelduling, management showing favortism, the pay and the lack of help. Other than those things walmart was almost perfect. Most enjoyable thing are the customers. Hardest thing was zoning frozen foods. Co-workers were cool."
good,I loved the people and the job I did but I wanted to go back t school to make more money!!
good,"I like working there but need a full time job,  management  is all right but they need more improvement the hardest part is allways smile at customer even if there rude to us ."
good,"Typically working shifts revolving around 2 p.m. - 11 p.m. running the cash registers was the primary job. i would then switch to which ever position the head CSM needed me at the most; ranging from customer service, returns, and helping bring in shopping carts. also, i frequently chose to stay over and help complete the tasks that needed done before the next morning. i learned to keep a cool head and not to take customer insults personally. learned how to deal with and assist angry customers in order to ensure customer satisfaction. time management and multitasking were the two key points i had to master to get through my days efficiently. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to do something for other people. the hardest part was spreading myself too thin, from jumping around to different positions fast just to keep lines down and customers happy."
good,"Fazer tour em todas as areas,verificar pontos de KPI'S,ser comerciante,saber liodar com o dia a dia da loja, pois muitas vezes temos ocorrencias tipicas."
good,It was most of the time really busy.A lot of work and things to stock.How to multitask better and lift the proper way to prevent me from getting injured. Management was a really big help when I didn't know where some things went they would help me find the right spot it went in to. Co-workers were really helpful they would help when I would get behind or help a customer when I was really busy.The hardest part of my job was having to stock and get the fish out of the tanks for the customers to buy. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be lunch and breaks.
good,"Nothing to say much i show up do my work and go home. Don't know how long this review has to be so I am just typing words here on the computer until it will let me advance to the next screen. I do not recommend working there if you life ambitions or goals in life, it is a place that people work that have given up on their dreams."
good,"Team Atmosphere I give it an A+ we all work hard to help one another and to keep a positive moral"
good,Working  everyday allows you to build relationships with the consumers of the store. Each day or every week you have the same customers who you look forward to seeing and who look forwards to seeing you in that short time for providing great service . Management however is not organized  or in the best interest of there employees . I recommend that each manager takes an extensive course on how to operate a business and have sufficient customer service skills because there is a lack  of communication and respect from management to client.
good,"set up work day for employees, count stock on floor and back room. pick stock from back room to go to sales floor. receive truck and unload check inventory and levels to maintain right stock on hand at all times. management some were uptight and did not listen at all others were there and helped as much as possible. co-workers some do what they want to do and you take the blame and others did what they needed to do to get the job done right"
good,The day generally starts out getting on the register and taking customers to get the lines down. When we didn't have customers we would work threw and sort returns to the right department. Once we were finished that we would recover the front section of the store. We would also help with displays and sometimes get pooled to the floor to help with stocking. The best part of the job was taking care of the customers and making sure they left satisfied.
good,This was a good stepping stone for further opportunity but offered little or no chance for full time work or advancement. Management was out of touch with employees as well as each other. Many times during the day I did not know what was expected from me. there is a feeling of unity with the employees which made going to work feel like family.
good,"I got this got to work  the midnight shift.I love my job there the people I would meet the customers that made my night enjoyable. The hardest part of the job were the hrs of when i had to come into work, I knew it was going to be hard but it was still rewarding. The best part of the job was meeting new and exciting people,"
good,"the daily basic is to deal with customer anytime, serve customer , take their orders in person or through the phone, make sure the orders are ready at the time."
good,Difficult to get along with management but the actual work itself is pretty easy
good,Hourly associates are poorly paid resulting in continuous turnover and poor skill level of associates.
good,"Helping customer with their purchases and fulfilling there needs with correct items for there electronic products. Sales, cashier and merchandising were the main priorities for this position."
good,A typical day at work consisted of cashiering and providing excellent customer service. I learned how to opperate a cash register. Managment was good just a little intimidating at times. My co-workers were friendly and very helpful. The most enjoyable part of my job was having returning customers come purposely to my register just so they could talk to me.
good,Learned a lot about tires. Customer service was poor from management.
good,"Normal shift entailed maintain complete stock of bike rack, insuring the garden area had enough demo grills and answering any customer questions with any product we would assemble in-store. When required store repairs would be preformed as well as filling other positions around the store when needed."
good,I enjoy interacting with the customer. i learn that we have to work as a team to get the job done. and I most enjoyable come to work all the time.
good,Met a lot of co-workers who were very nice and we assisted each other along the way.
good,"Wal-Mart was a very eye opening experience."
good,"I started at Walmart as a cashier and was promoted to customer service manager. As a CSM I learned more about the daily operations such money handling for cash office, schedulding for front end and customer service.  The hardest part of my was finding coverage for call ins. I worked overnight shift and its hard to just call people in at those hours.  The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers.  I love the statisfaction of helping others."
good,Not a good place to work. The scary part is not knowing if your will be yours the next day. Hardest part is nothings ever good enough.
good,"A typical day at works includes working at 4 (or more) different registers throughout the day, along with 2 (15 minute) breaks and one (60 minute) lunch. While working with Walmart, I have learned how to handle multiple situations with customers, whether they are hearing impaired or were unable to speak fluent English. My co workers in Winona and in Hastings were like a second family to me, they were wonderful people! Management has not been satisfying through out the three stores I have worked at EXCEPT one specific manger over the Pharmacy in Hastings. She went out of her way to make sure our schedules were perfect, and made sure all our needs were met! I loved coming to work to meet all the new exciting (and sometimes not so exciting) customers."
good,"Te dan las herramientas para poder trabajar se te da el apoyo emocional para seguir avanzando, recuerdo que mi Gte. es una persona humana y excepcional, tuve la dicha de trabajar con gente muy profesional que como yo les digo se quitaron minutos de su tiempo para siempre estar ahí cuando los necesitaba, como regresan dome la llamada y preguntándome en que me podían ayudar."
good,"it was ok here, concidering the 10% discount working there."
good,cashier stocking customer serivce. busy and fast pace environment
good,I enjoy working here but it is no place where you can build a career and grow. But you will gain a lot of knowledge here that you can take with you somewhere else.
good,"On the morning shift I would put out fresh product and help customers. In the evenings I would put out stock in various departments, making all the isles were in a neat order before I left. Continual customer service based."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in and seeing if there's any special tasks my supervisor could have requested. If nothing then I would go about my daily routine either zoning a beaten area by customers or stocking wall sections. I learned to be very independent and earn my stripes with the tasks at hand. The thing with management at walmart is they come and go. So it was hard to build relationships with managers there. The coworkers were good to work with for the most part. I would have to say the hardest part about the job would be , being understaffed at times when there was a large workload. But the most enjoyable part about the job though was the satisfaction I got from helping customers to the fullest extent."
good,Non-stop movement. The management only care about themselves. I did make a bunch of friends working there. The hardest part was the repetition. The most enjoyable moment was going home.
good,Taught me how to deal with rude customers and a lot with the public eye
good,Work and team great.   I followed the CSM orders and was let go.
good,"I learned how to input and fill prescriptions, assist customers at the pharmacy, and stock medicines properly. The most challenging part of the job was inputting prescriptions. Most of my co-workers were kind people. However, I worked with a pharmacist who lacked communication and people skills. I chose to stay at Walmart but at a different position.  Some other co-workers had the same problems, needing to leave the pharmacy as well. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things about medications."
good,"As a cashier I would check people out and deal with cash, debit cards, and credit cards, also gift cards. In customer service I learned how to do returns, money transfers, have customers pay their bills, cash checks and more. My co-workers were amazing people very energetic and very nice and helped you out whenever you needed it. The management was helpful at times although sometimes they would let things slide which sometimes was not fair. The hardest part of my job was lifting really heavy items alone. The most enjoyable part of my job was the environment and atmosphere. Most of the people who worked there were very nice and made work fun sometimes."
good,management was no good and thay always move you around and thay dont pay you the difference for the area
good,"A lot of middle management. Lots of associates in a higher position that feel the need to direct associates without proper communication between management. Low wages while expecting superior service. "
good,Deal with lots of customers. Focus hard to get the job done. Remember lots of different codes for the register.
good,"Good Company; Fortune 500 Company, Need to improve benefits and compensation"
good,"Setup printing machine for orders at the beginning of my shift. Documented disposable cameras for shipping to be developed."
good,A typical day for this part time person is coming to work at variously scheduled times. I am a cashier and receive payment in different forms and return change if required. Immediate supervisors are good and helpful people. I do not see management very much. The hardest part of the job is being polite to very rude people. I also enjoy talking with and helping the nicer people.
good,"Uma empresa que nunca atraso meu salário, que tem um plano de saúde bom para o associado, más que não soube me valorizar quando estava em alta, fui promovido e não vi oportunidades de crescimento depois de um tempo, o que me desmotivou."
good,When an employee needs to see a manager regarding a customer. Communication is important. As a former worker I have realized how a lack of this key element can result in a bad experience as well as decreased moral and even frustration.
good,"No opportunity for advancement in the company"
good,"TLE Technician and Service Writer "
good,Wal-Mart was not a bad place to work although the manager would constantly bring his personal problems to work making for awkward situations. My fellow employees were great and even now some of them are still close friends. The pay was alright and the hours were Fantastic. However they seem to hire in bulk and then lay off all of the employees that are supposed to be paid more and keep the ones they can pay less. In my experience not very fair. They did have a lot of good opportunity programs however.
good,"As a supervisor over a total of five different departments, managing priorities is key.  First thing in the morning, I would be given a list of manager notes, which needed to be completed by 4pm. After those were completed, I had to make sure all of the previous night's freight was completed, worked, and binned.  Once that was completed, I had to scan my side counters and fill and count all my outs on the shelf.  During this process, I also created counts if my on-hands for a certain product were wrong.  Every week, I needed to complete any mods (merchandise changes on the sales floor) that needed to be done. The last part of my day was usually working on price changes and making sure that every item had the correct label.  "
good,"I wish we had a higher salary, also wish management treated employee's better"
good,"Job provided little advancement despite good work reviews"
good,Love the associates I worked with not the management. not a lot of communication from the front end to management
good,"Recopilacion de datos Financieros , ventas comparativascon años anteriores, revicion de reportes diarios , para el control administrativo dando reportes , diarios para su evaluacion a jefes  de departamento, para el auxilio de sus  actividades como verificacion de el manejo de inventario de la tienda, ventas  para su resurtido, manejo de planogramas , avances generados por este , siendo semanal mente,control de capacidad en estante de los articulos siendo este 2 veces a la semana, Transmicion de  pago a proveedores , asi como a proveedores de mantenimiento  a tienda , verificacion de reporte  libro diario  o libro mayor , reclasificacion de cuentas."
good,It was a good place to work. My job was very fast paced there was always something to do. My coworkers were very good to me they were patient with me when I was learning how to run the cash register. The hardest part of my job was the unrealistic expectations set by management but I never gave up or complained. The greatest part of my job was the interactions with the customers and seeing them leave with a smile on they're faces.
good,"Although all the managers are competent at my store (4288) we do have a unusually high turnover rate in management.  Since I have been working there only 2 assistant managers (out of 9) have remained.  I am now on the 3rd store manager and have lost count of how often my supervisors have changed."
good,A place where you go to work until advancement. Not to much to elaborate on.
good,"everyone had there own project to complete and stock I did the same thing on a daily basis, clean the bathroom take out the trash and buff the floor."
good,"experiência no setor de textil e bazar leve experiência com meta de vendas . Facilidade na aprendizagem, Habilidosa e eficiente na realização de atividades; Grande capacidade de realizar trabalhos em equipe Desempenhar os trabalhos da melhor forma possível visando o melhor resultado, Busca pelo crescimento profissional aliado ao crescimento pessoal."
good,Not worth it if you are looking to build a report with a company. The upper management is poor but the assistants are not bad. The floor workers can either be good or bad.
good,"Walmart's employees are very hard workers who receives little recognition and appreciation from the company and customers. They offer minimum training to perform job duties. They require excessive amount of computer training while expecting to complete job duties at the same time. At minimum wage, they hire employees to initially perform specific job duties, such as, sales clerk, but doesn't inform new employees that they will be expected to perform all job duties within the store, such as cashier and janitorial, nor inform new workers that they will be required to work in all departments, such as ""Refrigeration"" or ""Sporting Goods"" to sell guns and bullets. None of these ""changes or expectations"" are mentioned in the interview. Employees are expected to learn on the spot for lack of formal training. Due to training on the spot, or lack of, it jeopardizes their relationship with customers, employees and management."
good,If you've ever had your oil changed at Wal-mart you'd know where I am coming from with the overall rating for this particular location.  Really liked the people that and culture that I worked in while I was there.
good,I learned a lot at this job with inventory and sales. I love the people I worked with always a good time. the hardest part of the job is that they want you to a lot of projects that take a lot of time and expect you to finish them all with making sure you have all of your daily routine done and zoning.
good,Its a good job if you have a very an abundant amount of patience. the amount of personalities you see everyday is overwhelming especially if your a cashier. It also tires you out if you dont move around...its hard to stay positive.
good,"Wal-Mart is just a job management treats their employees unfair, we are under paid for all we put up with, and its a lot of favoritism."
good,"I enjoyed my job until I transferred to a different store where the management team, more so the store manager, wasn't up to par with what was supposed to happening."
good,Typical day at work involved logging into the phones and assisting representatives solve problems.  I also take escalated calls from upset customers.  Other tasks included updating and posting teams stats.  Management changed fairly regularly from other programs or from advancing.   The hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers all day.  What I enjoyed most was helping other representatives solve problems.
good,Not a very satisfying place to work if you enjoy one on one patient interaction.
good,"my day start on is organize last night in the backroom. this is done by bin it into bin. then able to go to sales for to organize pick and order the items that needs me on sales for. in a 8 hour day I do need to do price changes, to create end caps, do notes that management like to see done end of the work day. I do have people to help me with the goals."
good,Learned a lot in my year of work here. I would Recommend this job to a college student. Good way to earn money and balance school.
good,"I learned how to work and deal with customers, it was a very friendly environment. The hardest part of the job was when the customers would get upset of an product we didn't have. Overall I enjoyed my job."
good,"I was an overnight third shift 'Maintenance Associate'.  I was cross trained as an overnight 'Stocking Associate' within my first week there.  The management was helpful regarding the need for more hours, etc.  Walmart is a decent place to get into a short term or long term career in retail."
good,"-my night at work was never slow"
good,"I would say Walmart is a good place to work. The only thing I would say is an issue is that management isn't very stable the rotating of them every six months really messes things up in my opinion, nothing was ever consistent. All of my coworkers were excellent. Great hard working people, and I would say that was the best part of the job. Being able to help people and meet new energetic customers every day. Working at Walmart made me very adaptable to different situations in the workforce, they always had us doing something different. That really helped in getting me prepared for all the different jobs out there."
good,Everyday I busy you get breaks every few hours. I enjoyed working with the customers and doing my job.
good,Wal-Mart was a good job i just didn't feel like i can get higher promotions there
good,"A typical work day in my department includes, zoning regularly, assisting customers with questions, making purchases, activating cell phones through carriers such as Verizon and AT&T and assisting with photos. My direct manager and assistant manager are very helpful throughout the department and are constantly keeping it stocked and help us with our tasks with maintaining the department."
good,"i love working there, i just need to find a job working with less standing as i have a balance issue and standing is hard for me. i would cash out customers, give breaks, go where ever needed whenever needed. i got along with most coworkers and mangers."
good,"typical day at work was just ringing customers in the check out."
good,I worked in the backroom and it was a good job with its ups and downs. I learned a lot of things that i will apply at my next job. Management could use some tweaking. I loved my co-workers everyone knows there roll and does their best to get the job done in a timely manner. The hardest part of my job was the backroom getting over crowed sometimes with freight but we managed to get it under control. The best part was going home after a long night of hard work.
good,"Though my fellow coworkers were usually fun to work with, the upper management could be uncooperative and at times hostile."
good,it was ok the pay was low but meeting the customers was great great co-workers
good,"Es un negocio familiar,el cual me ayudo a conocer mercancía, asi como el correcto servicio al cliente."
good,"When I started working at Walmart, I kept thinking ""This beats my previous job!"" But as time (and years) went on, I slowly started to realize the truth--that the only thing working at Walmart is good for is paying college tuition and bills, and that's it. Maybe it's because I became jaded to the environment, maybe it's because it felt like work no longer matter, I don't know, but it's come to the point where working isn't ""fun"" anymore--when that happens, it's time to start looking somewhere else."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart, it is basically a good atmosphere to work if you like to help customers. The best part of working there is the diversity of the people they hiring to work at the store. The Co-workers are the most enjoyable part of working for this type of company."
good,A typical day at work was easy going. I learned how to never let a customer leave unsatisfied. I also learned about different electronics while working in that department. Management was confusing. I would have one manager tell me to do one thing and another manager tell me not to do my current task and to do something else. My co-workers were very helpful and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was informing a customer that we didn't have certain items in stock. I never want a customer leaving unsatisfied. The most enjoyable part about the job was my work schedule.
good,"Too many egos in the management positions. Managers at the West Mifflin store are just that managers, they are not leaders. The management staff that were, worth anything, were handcuffed by senior management.Shift or Co managers never talked to each other about the direction the store needed to go, passing a lot of blame to their counter parts. High turnover rate floated around 70%."
good,While I was in college this was an excellent job because I did not require full time employment. They were also very flexible around classes and breaks. They paid quite well with bonuses based on hard work.
good,I arrive at work. I clock in. I walk to the front . I greet everyone. I get to work.
good,"Get assigned register. Clean around area when slow. Watch and problems at self check-outs. Refunds, money gram transactions, cash checks, bill payments, get pre-ordered merchandise from back. Zone and stick shelves."
good,"Working as a cashier and customer service was a wonderful experience, I enjoyed helping people to find what they were looking for to pay bills and wire money. Working as in stock is the hardest part of my job working third shift and stocking shelves with very little customers."
good,"Basically, you get paid to work your butt off with no support. It was terrible."
good,"Working for  Walmart is an good  first  time job , it an easy job to work at , co worker jus like family to me and the management could be better , I have learn a lot by working fast and cleaner , sometime we get crazy people here and there but most of it an ok job."
good,"I started in Asset Protection, which involved catching shop lifters, It was a careful process, with many steps, and lots of people willing to help. I learned how to fill out the paperwork, work with people who where very upset, defuse a tense situation, and work with the authorities. There where some communication issues between departments, and with management. I enjoyed my co-workers, and felt honored with the trust other employees bestowed on me. The hardest part was communicating my departments needs to the management. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people, even if they didn't really want it. "
good,"Working here was not to bad. I also learned a lot here.  Receiving, ordering, helping customers, putting stock away, and doing paper work."
good,The most rewarding part of my job is helping people on a day to day basis.  The people I work with are great and enjoyable.
good,"alot of customers, its okaya typical day at work"
good,Wal-mart Has a fine atmosphere. The management could use help. The hardest part of the job was working around the incredibly inconsistent schedule. The benefits are nice though.
good,"Every day at the job is different. The retail industry can be hectic, but rest assure that there is always a lesson to learn. I have learned so much since I have been with the company: how to manage merchandise flow: Learning how to manage people, deal with customers, how to merchandise, how to meet deadlines, and to sum it up, how to make the impossible happen."
good,"A typical day for me was spending 4 1/2 - 8 hours on a register for 5 days out of the week. Days off were never on the weekend and were rarely together and if you didn't close your availability, they had you work until midnight and had you come back at 8 the next morning. The good thing about cashiering is that the hours are rarely cut. You consistently get 25-35 hours. I think the hardest part was getting promoted. I did enjoy working with people though and the other cashiers were great."
good,um dia tipico de trabalho era sempre muito trabalho muita separação nao poderia haver nenhum erro sempre esta no ponto no horario certo aonde o onibos buscava a gente  o q eu aprendi aprendi o q ja sabia me deixou ainda mas esperiente por ja ter trabalhado nesta aria ja sabia como seria de muitas empresas que trabalhei a gerncia e a direçaõ a melhor foi tdb esta empresa nunca falhava com seu fucionario de la eu rendi frutos outras nao posso falar o mesmo meu colegas de trabalho um dos melhores foi pela tdb tambem el me ensinou td q sei a conferir separar e muito mas ate assumi o lugar dele qnd ele faltava e qnd ele saiu a parte mas dificil sempre foi em varias empresas o pagamentos as vezes muitas empresas nao depositava extra e falhava na parte do pagamento nos dias exatos e é isto.
good,This job is very informative. they allow you to branch out and seek knowledge. The only problem is some of your fellow associates have hard days on the job and tend to take it out on fellow associates. Advancement is also difficult as you are not actually in Home Office and no one notices anything you do unless it is a dire emergency.
good,In my time at Walmart in Malone there was an unusually high turn over rate for a place that has a good work culture.
good,Unrealistic expectations for production.  Unfair management.  Unwillingness to work with me as a student.  The most physically demanding job I have ever had in an unsafe work environment like 130 degree temperatures in the warehouse during the summer without giving any slack to their employees when it comes to production.
good,"•	Instrumental in developing the category and managing over 3000+ sku’s Pan India."
good,Like the title says other then that its ok I mean if you like to put up with stupid questions all the time this the job for you
good,"it was a good part time job while i was going to school, not so much as a career"
good,"i like working at Walmart,its fast paced most of the time and i have made a lot of friends, management is easy to work with most of the time and i like working with the public,"
good,"Wal-Mart is extremely unpleasant to work for. The higher ups at the corporate level seem to have an utter disconnect from the way day to day reality works. Pay and benefits are terrible, and advancement is extremely difficult."
good,I really do not want to explain it all but it was okay just a lot of negativity.
good,"adiqueri conhecimento, aprendi a lidar com situações inesperada, trabalho equipe é uma boa direcão"
good,"I had great co workers and my boss was great. Once they changed store managers, everything went downhill and it was not the same fun place to work at."
good,Store is a nice place to work associates follow direction well.
good,"When training, they have a training specialist, but they also work in the dept so they didn't have the time needed to train a new employee effectively."
good,This was the first real job that I had. It was definitely a learning experience with working with the management but I wouldn't change it. I made some life long friends and learned some great lessons on how to work and how not to work within a corporation.
good,You'll be able to learn about every department no matter what department you work in. Very people friendly. Great opportunity.
good,frogando   lideres que  emprendan las  tareas  a  realizan esforzándose  a no dejar  lo de  hoy para  mañana
good,Love the people and the culture. Able to talk and associate with everyone you come in contact with.
good,"Managment wont communicate with each other the associates so usually a lot of confusion about how toget things done, never enough associates scheduled for a shift, associates usually have to work 2 or 3 departments a night"
good,"Greet people with friendly smile"
good,"walmart isnt a bad place to work if you actually work hard and smile at the same time, i enjoyed being an employee there."
good,It a typical repetitive jobs. I learned to be patient on this type of job especially to our supervisors.
good,I dont like the enviorment point blank period. Managment has terrible attitudes the only hard thing at this job is dealing with the csm and css
good,My typical day of work started at 10pm since i worked the overnight shift. We had a meeting with all of the overnight employees and our manager before our shift started. I learned how to operate a forklift and work well with others. The managers there were fair and as long as you did your work they easy to get along with. My co-workers were the best and worst part of the job. Some of them became very close friends and others are thought of as scum due to their terrible work ethics. The hardest part of my job was the shift itself 10pm to 7am. But the most enjoyable part was the people i worked with.
good,"Walmart is a great place for students and individuals who want to make quick cash and need flexible hours and scheduling. Full time employees get great benefits and great hours per week."
good,Productive workplace was able to interact with coworkers and customers. Met many interesting people.
good,"three ring circus, best way to describe management. co workers are great most of them, hardest thing I seen from my perspective is trying to finish the assignments given  ."
good,"A typical day at Walmart, could include a very slow pace or a crazy, busy, hectic one.  I learned personal cashiering & customer service techniques, to help in satisfying our customers. Management was fair, yet practical with company policies.  My co-workers were people I considered my friends and colleagues.  The hardest part of my job was, keeping customers satisfied and processing their purchases & helping with questions, in a quick, timely fashion.  The most enjoyable part of my job was, I thoroughly enjoyed what I did.  I have been a cashier for many years, with a variety of employers. And, it has been a career choice that I have been very pleased with.  "
good,No one is in any sort of a hurry to do anything so when someone comes around who is they get worn out really fast doing everything and then fall into the same trap. If you are a persistent at working hard you might get to move up the chain but that's a very slow process.
good,I enjoy working at this company but feel I would be better off in a job that is more customer service oriented. I enjoy my co-workers and consider many of them to be friends. I need a job where the management is more tolerant of employees with health issues.
good,Working at Wal-Mart was a challenge in its self. I was there for nine years. I enjoyed my job at first and as the years went on it burnt me out. I worked in numerous departments. The hardest part of my job was making sure to keep the customers happy without losing our integrity.
good,"I liked working at walmart, i guess because i am such a people person. it could be hard work sometimes but over all it was great."
good,Great opportunity for advancement if you are willing to move.
good,managment unprofessional. did what i had to to get threw the day
good,"Buena empresa, con problemas como todas pero estan trabajando en mejorar buen manejo con el tema de sindicatos falta mas apoyo desde la central de wallmart"
good,Walmart was a good place to work alot of diffrent people and you also got to learn alot about the company witch was good.
good,"My main job was to detect, observe and apprehend external shoplifters by floor observation. I learned the different ways to blend into the general public without being noticed and my detect skills reading body language, face expressions, etc. were greatly increased. My supervisor was a great, he held his own weight, maintain constant communication with me and was very flexible with my schedule. The hardest part of the job was finding out where to be in a Supercenter Wal-Mart at the right time to detect a shoplifters. The best part was there was no shortage in supplies or anything else we needed...the budget that was given was very large so it made it easier seeing that we had the supplies we needed 24/7."
good,"I really enjoy working with and getting to know my co-workers, but there is little chance of advancement and management has favoritism with certain employees. Walmart is a very hard place to work because of the demand put on the employees. Employers should   really consider the worth and value of an individual if they have worked at Walmart just because the way employees are worked and treated."
good,"Pay is not the best, but at least it is steady work and fairly easy work"
good,A day in Walmart was a very busy day. I learned how to deal with different people and also how to handle difficult customers. I enjoyed working with my fellow co workers. Dealing with management was not always easy to deal with.
good,"Each shift consists of three to five tasks to complete throughout the night. In doing this for three months now, I have learned how to better manage my time and multitask. The management is decent and always willing to work with any issues that may arise. The hardest part of my job is having the right partner in my department to help complete the freight and tasks. The most enjoyable part of my shift would have to be the last hour due to the fact that it is just zoning and cleaning up my area before leaving work."
good,Company is working on the management issue. But been going on so long it is not going to fast.
good,"Doesn't have consistency."
good,"The area I worked for was okay, I only worked for two days because of personal reasons at home."
good,I gave 13 years to Walmart then fired me for B.S. being in retail you would think they want to promote not they want you to be a follower and don't have a brain to use.
good,"very hard"
good,Fast paced place to work where you will stay busy. A friendly work environment.
good,Manaement sucked nd they dint know what they are doing. I olny enjoyed the customers
good,"Stocks of merchandise were periodically checked as necessary."
good,"While the job was very useful for helping with my college expenses, the management was not very skilled at their position. Problems in our department were often times caused by their interference and we would regularly be blamed for their mistakes. All they seemed to care about was keeping the shelves full and would often take us away from our designated job areas to work in other departments only to yell at us shortly after due to our section needing work."
good,"Wal-Mart is a great way to get comfortable around people. the people in the environment for the most part are great. I learned how to be a peoples person. i used to speak low because i was so shy, but walmart opened the doors for me,  i learned to speak up and become more open. most coworkers are cool but you have them ones who take there job to serious and never smile. there's no hard part to this job everything is basically self explanatory."
good,"Walmart started off as a great opportunity, as I got to know the company, management was a wreck and opportunity was not based on your performance."
good,Oferece aprendizado e oportunidades para crescimento interno.
good,"I am assigned to the clothing dept.  This entails working the fitting room, answering incoming calls and transferring them to correct area."
good,I worked here when I was just getting out of school as and unloader. the thing that was worst about the job was the hours 230-when u finished all the trucks. pay wasn't the greatest for the type of work you were doing. trucks were often really hot or really cold wasn't an in-between.
good,"My department is always busy, If not with customers, we are busy with freight. We always have freight to put out. The jewelry department is also responsible for the show department. Working with the public I have learn to have patience. A lot of patience. I get along with all my co-workers and management. The hardest part about the job is the holidays and football season.. Those are the most stressful times but yet it is also the most enjoyable times too. Because I get to interact with the customers."
good,"I work overnight. My summary and pros & cons should should paint a picture of how a typical Walmart employee experience is. Just research and read others' detailed reviews for yourself. There's better and worst job descriptions and experiences out there but the bottom line is if you want a JOB, Walmart will more than likely hire you."
good,"ambiente extresante ,desiciones indefinidas . llevar un orden un control en cuestion laboral ,poca resolucion dde problemas en cuestion laboral , la parte mas difil ,seria en manejo dde codigos o versiones diferentes para un sistema de la empresa ,"
good,"fué positivo , sobre todo por la experiencia en donde se aprende a hacer rápido y expeditivo"
good,"When I first started at walmart we had a smoke room, an extra dollar an hour for working on sundays, good benefits, and people who had business sense. That all went away.  I quit because I disagreed with the way the company was being run. Most people didn't like their job and ended up being over worked. As an asset protection associate we monitored shoplifting suspects and apprehended them.  Before I quit they pretty much tied our hands so we couldn't defend ourselves and we couldn't get a high dollar stop. O ya and your judged every month on how many you caught so if you didn't catch very many for a few months straight no matter what the reason (many ran, etc.) you would be fired or asked to step down. anyone considering walmart as an employer I suggest you either work elsewhere or work there just long enough to find a better job. They work you to death and they wont tell the average employee this but its an unwritten rule that they will not give the highest yearly raise even if you do excel at your job."
good,"A typical day at work started with team meeting with supervisor"
good,"When  I first started it was the beginning of the Christmas season and it was a busy time. We kept cases stocked and the floor displays stocked. We all worked well together. The  hardest part of the day was getting breaks, if there weren't enough associates to give breaks. Also couldn't ever get a manager to assist a customer."
good,"a typical day of work really varies depending on the department you work at. for example i work in frozen and everyday we have to pick of the third shifts slack. whether it be IMS responsibilities or the frozen workers. everyday we do more work than we are supposed to. the management likes to pretend they sympathize with you but really they don't care. for frozen you are pretty much on your own because its ""too cold"" for anyone else to be in there aside from you and the people you work directly with. the co-workers are always good as long as you keep a steady work pace."
good,"Wal Mart has good benefits you can move up to a different position if you want to. Good co-workers.  It is a very busy store, have to be ready to handle a customers questions,  or concerns you never have a regular day at Wal Mart. You learn something new every day at Wal-Mart."
good,A typical day you are given assignment as you are about to start you are pulled into other area you are talked to you as were a child if one manger doesn't feel like you put out enough freight you are written up
good,"pessoas agradaveis"
good,"Typical fast paced 9hr shift."
good,"Retail.  Plans consistently require ammending to manage the business demands. Plan the work, work the plan."
good,"the most enjoyable part of working at Walmart is being able to find good friends."
good,Working here was okay but some management made it hard cause it was alot of favorites and they didn't want people leaving to transfer to another store to advance. They really didn't have no concern of what kind of life or death issue you had at home just as long as you worked sick or not. The only thing I liked was the benefits and friends made.
good,"This company has changed with every new ceo placed in the corporation. Some were good, some not very."
good,"Do your job, and leave"
good,The best part of working here was being able to work with the public everyday. Meeting people and having conversations with people is very enjoyable to me. The downfall was I have always felt as more a number then an actual person working at Wal-Mart.
good,I enjoyed my time as a gardener.  I received my fork lift license and training from Floralogix Inc in plant care.  I am quite knowledgeable in Horticulture zones 5-10.
good,"Generally, it was okay I dealed with the bad managers, and the work, but I did meet some friends and families I really got along with and the daily's I got from the job."
good,Management was terrible. Enough reason to quit. Employee discount is not even worth it.
good,"A typical day for me at walmart was clock in, and work. often draged around to different area's of the store. worked 8 hour shifts. and helped people alot. I learned that as long as i can maintain a smile and keep helping people that i can turn them into long term customers. my time manage was great. but upper management not so much. I often went to a higher manager to see what exactly needed to be done. the co-workers made the job a little less stressful. the hardest part of the job was to learn produce sections. because you need to take classes to become qaint with the proceedures. most enjoyable part of the job was making money, aside from that i enjoyed helping people, and making long term customers."
good,A typical day at this work environment was pleasant at first but then got stressful as each day got on. Management was constantly changing things.
good,"Walmart was a very enjoyable place to work as long as your management team was on your side. After a while though, Walmart turned into what felt like high school.  Everyone had their favorites and catered to them.  I loved my job at Walmart and I loved the customers.  I just couldn't handle how management treated their associates as numbers instead of actual people."
good,"I learned how to manage associates."
good,"Overall the work experience was about average. The management made decisions that weren't always the best for the worker's atmosphere which caused more stress, and some of the co-workers were actively unwilling to do their job correctly which caused slow down in other areas of the store because we had to assist in those areas before moving on to other tasks."
good,"In regard to working for Walmart I enjoy my co-workers and helping customers.  However, the lack of staff and management issues are a great concern."
good,"Tried for several months to transfer to frontend and would not letme cause was told no one to put back in Automotive.  When I left and went back to shop and had another job, that is when they were going to let me move to front end."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is right after lunch when there is optimism about how the shift will end and joy about what has been accomplished up until then
good,Would get there around 7 and count our tills and clean and get ready to open up the shop. I would take care of customers inside and outside in the shop. I really enjoyed working there but was not enough money.
good,"Day to day responsibilities rarely change, as most associates are given more tasks than hours available.  Management is a hit or miss, some give associates space to work, some micromanage the entire team."
good,Not interested in offering a review of this business as I do not care for the work environment. I moved on.
good,es un buen ambiente laboral tanto que los asociados se quedan por años pero es un mal sueldo
good,"I worked at Walmart off and on from 2002 to 2011. I have watched that compnay go through a lot of changes. Some for the best others for the worst. I worked freight, did price changes, worked with customers, and did other things that management needed of me."
good,"El trabajo es de cierta forma agradable, ya que en mi área de trabajo me desempeño con empleados de características profesionales en su que hacer diario, no obstante, los empleados externos a mi área que desempeñan funciones en mi sector de trabajo (re ponedores) no son compatibles (algunos) con mi perfil profesional. Lo que conlleva a un desorden administrativo en mi área de trabajo. Con respecto a la compatibilidad de mi vida personal y el trabajo, la evaluó de forma deficiente, debido a que me es difícil llevar mi vida personal a perfecta plenitud, por motivos de tiempo y exigencia que demanda la empresa a mi persona. Siendo así tengo muy poco tiempo para estar con mi familia. El salario correspondiente a mi trabajo, no es el que cubre mi desempeño, mostrándome inconforme con la proporcionalidad de mi desempeño con mi pago. La parte administrativa en reiteradas ocasiones no es justa y no compatibiliza con las exigencias que demandan al empleado. Muchos de los empleados no contribuyen de forma cultural al desarrollo del trabajo, siendo esto porque no toman su trabajo en serio y de la forma profesional que este lo requiere."
good,A typical day at work is stocking freight. It is a very stressful and tiring job.
good,"Typical day or work involved me teaming up with every team in multiple areas of Wal-Mart to complete tasks. I've learned that management here thinks they are leadership just because of the position power they are in. I know this is not true to be a successful leader, one must truly get to know the people you lead. I've heard management telling another associate that she does not trust the people she manages and that is the reason why she treats them like kids."
good,es una empresa que promueve un ambiente muy agradable de trabajo
good,"es una empresa con muy buen ambiente para trabajar y personas muy calidas,me encantò trabajar en la empresa"
good,"I worked for WalMart for a little over a year, only because I was a college student. The head managers are rude and act as if they are not human and do not understand the needs of their associates.  Walmart tries to work you hard for minimum pay. A typical day in the summer is very uncomfortable, not only to customers but to associates as well. It's been plenty of times I felt light headed because of the amout of heat in the building. What I learned from working for Walmart is they are more focused on making money than their associates well being. They rather you come in to work and risk spreading your cold to others than stay home and rest.  My co-workers where the main reason I stayed for so long. They are very positive, fun to be with, and motivivating. The hardest part of the job in my opinion would be dealing with rude customers, but hey that's retail. Some customers really belittle you as if you owe them something because you work at Walmart. Oh let's not forget how some of the racist people that come there as well.  I've been called a woman of ""my color"". I have been cursed at multiple times for things not being available in the store, likes its my fault. I have spoken to customers and they do not speak back. Lets please nit forget the customers that get mad when your light is off and you tell them you're closed. The worst part is the customers that throw their money on the counter when you have your hand out, expect you to pick it up then hand them their change In their hand. In the end management usually does not do anything about it, but encourages you to just take"
good,"A typical day at work the customer's make my day, management are not on one page. I love my co workers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with assistant manager that try to fight against you, not giving you any hours like others associates don't have a family to care of."
good,"I enjoyed helping people. A typical day consisted of assisting with product placement, answering phones, and completing department goals. The staff was friendly and helpful as I made my transition. It wasn't a difficult job although the pay was low, I was fulfilled in my working status."
good,"For the most part the managers have no clue what they are doing, although most managers are nice they lack respect, hours are being cut and hard workers ignored. I know that you should not talk bad about your place of work but its the worst I have experienced. I know with the right motivation it can get better."
good,"They are a great company to work for but they are too worried about your personal life. At first it was just getting to know each other then it became blatantly nosy. They want to know your relationships, school info, and home life. They were getting the info for work purposes its just so that can gossip about it or to schedule you non-stop especially if you have no other obligations at home. Mainly Asst. managers and customer service employees are the worst when they have nothing to attend to but not all of them."
good,"A good work environment, but seriously understaffed, this caused a lot of people to be overworked and exhausted. Scheduling made it so there was little time for an outside life."
good,"Working for Walmart has its ups and downs. wages are very low for the amount of work you put in. The managers are unprofessional and unorganized. Even though you do not expect it, there's lots of politics within Walmart."
good,i was intitle to clean the whole facility. what i like about the job was that i get help customer too there need and my smile and always happy
good,Stocked floors and made sure product looks full. Lovely co workers but customers can be abrupt
good,"MY day starts out busy and, we stays that way most of the time. We have to put the stock out and bin it in that's left over from the night before.    "
good,There were times employees got into trouble for talking to customers too much. Management didn't like the employees to help show customers where things were located if that meant leaving the department.
good,Typical day was me smiling and saying hi on my way back to clock in. Go to the front find out where i am stationed . When not helping the customers fronting the merchandise and picking up the returns around my area and talk to my coworkers.Management had ups and downs. Some managers gave us some rope and others held it so tight that it would hurt us. Loved most of my co-workers. Hardest part was when the managers that tightened the rope where working and a breathe of fresh air when it was the other ones.
good,It was fun sure for a time but it wasn't a job i was going to stay in for long.
good,Involves dedication in order to make the customer experience an enjoyable one.
good,"Working for walmart can be a good thing or a bad thing. You have to really love retail, and know how to handle different personalities in the management."
good,"Lately the work environment has become very stressful. Due to understaffing in all departments and the automotive department, I am now required to learn all areas of the store even though I am primarily in the automotive department. We are required to have a certain number of employees staffed in TLE which our management teams doesn't do or seem to care to do. Then they will pull our short staffed people to work in other departments that are short staffed. Its not a problem if we are not busy but they do it also when we are busy creating longer wait times for customers and customer complaints that go constantly unsolved. Wal-Mart is a multi billion dollar company but yet can not keep us up to staff and with the slim staff we have now cut hours to the point where it is hard for us to make ends meet and we are now living paycheck to paycheck. The other employees I work with and I have been able to still make the days enjoyable as much as possible and try our hardest to please customers with limited resources."
good,"A day at work at Wal-Mart was usually very busy and this is just how retail is.  Management was in the store and approachable if they were needed.  Co-Workers worked together as a team to get the job done.  The hardest part of the job at Wal-Mart was dealing with the part where you didn't always get your breaks.  The most enjoyable part of the job at Wal-Mart was the benefits.  A retail job at Wal-Mart did offer me Medical, Dental and Vision benefits for myself and my family."
good,"Sometimes it's hard to jugle everything that needs to be done by all the different managers givng you directions on tasks to complete while still trying to take care of customers. Most of my co-workers are good about helping each other out when they themselves are not stretched out on tasks. For the most part wal-mart is a good place to work. I enjoy interacting with my customers and helping them find what they are looking for or suggesting another alternative to what they may need. I like staying busy; just not overwhelmed. One of the issues that I have learned with all my years at wal-mart is that no two managers are on the same page; you have one telling you that a task needs to be done this way then another comes along and says it should be done that way...double work cause then you have to redo it. I like my job and I have learned many aspects on how to run the operations of a retail store, and how not to. There are always changes in how to we do our jobs each day, some are for the better and then there are some that just makes our work harder to get it all done in an 8hr shift."
good,It was ok. I didn't like that they had a 6 point system and took off for every little thing you did wrong at work.
good,A typical day at work for me is clocking in and getting into the mode of a customer service representative which entails that you block out the negative thoughts and keep a positive mind. Ive learned alot of interpersonal skills with this job and I also got to meet some gret peopl along the way. The hardest part pf my job is not letting angry people effect your attitude. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and loving those around me that i work with on a daily basis.
good,"courir comme des fou pour satisfairte les clients et les patrons"
good,"Over all feeling that employees are a necessary expense, and that if they could run the store without you they would to save money."
good,"productive"
good,"Wal-Mart was a descent place to work at while going to school. They would usually work around my school schedule. "
good,"stalking shelves with product and building displays,cashier when needed and customer service"
good,Most of the management has no idea what they are doing. If you go to management with a question about your position they are almost always unable to answer it.
good,"Loved my co-workers.. Benefits are pretty good if you can actually land a position that will give you enough hours to use them."
good,"I did not expect to be working as many hours as I did and I was ignored when I requested to be given less hours each week (I asked several times). The stress of the job, both emotional and physical, forced me to take an early leave of absence while I was pregnant."
good,"My store in general was VERY understaffed. Upper management was horrible, needed replaced. The most enjoyable part of the job was the the associated that i worked with in my department, we had to make out job fun! The hardest part was that we were short of the right amount of employees so we were asked to do three and four things at a time which was impossible, which was even said by management. Loved the co-workers in my area, they are how i made it through the day!"
good,Walmart is great place. Don't wish to judge too harsh haveing starting with them during the heights of the Christmas rush. Was a little busy time. but overall I believe it was good education
good,ok good coulda been better but it was find its a job so they more employees.. .............................
good,"The job kept me busy and the days went by quickly. I came to work and filled prescriptions, worked with customers to ensure their needs were met. I dealt with insurance companies by phone to ensure tht customers / patients recieved the proper medications at the right price. I trained on the HIIPAA Law and was assigned to teach new hires in the pharmacy about the law. I enjoyed working with the customers / patients and the insurance contacts. The hardest part about the job was dealing with immature people who brought their personal issues to work with them."
good,"Walmart was a fun place to work at, Management wasn't the greatest."
good,just a job. i liked working there but not really interested in working there anymore.
good,Overall I am happy with what I have learned while working here. I have  had to learn how to handle a lot of stressful work situations while working here.
good,"Always busy, never a dull moment working with in walmart doors"
good,"this store is a very fast paced and things change on a hourly basis, I have learned to work fast and with great detail, I enjoying working with different people, and taking on new challenges"
good,"Typical shift was checking which aisle I was assigned (which was different most nights), checking how much stock I had, stocking shelves, zoning or facing merchandise, and helping other finish."
good,"I would start with doing picks that would generate from the system that needed to be stocked on the sales floor.Assist customers in concerns and choices of products,assist coworkers on accurate counts on the shelves and answer their questions.The last part of the day I spent inventory prepping items in the binns for accurate onhand counts"
good,"I worked in the girls department and the fitting room. I answered phones,assisted with purchases and did pricing. i was also trained to do stock,inventory and operate the cash register"
good,"Hard to get work done because 2/3 managers didn't know what they were doing, managers always undermining each other. Employees constantly quitting, new hires slack off, most quit. Expected to ignore blatant company rule violations, fire code violations. Store manager has star employees written up for menial things to keep them from transferring. Was denied promotion for someone younger and completely untrained. Expected to stay late every day to cover for others slacking off, overtime forbidden so you constantly had to cut hours and were blamed for everything."
good,At Wal-Mart I worked as a seasonal cahier. My main duty here was to check out customer grocceriers and merchandise. I never seen my manager and usually learned thing's from co-worker's.
good,long days must be customer friendly and cooperative and flexible with management
good,Love greeting people with a smile and helping the customers with what every questions or concerns they may have and keeping my flow of getting them checked out as fast as I can because no one wants to stand in line for long checkout lines. Iv'e learned that some people have patience and some don't but I still learn to maintain a great positive attitude through it all. management is ok but could be better. My co-workers we work as a team and that's what I love about my co-workers. The hardest part is no consistency you never know when things done changed. I enjoy my co-workers because some of us have a special bond together and when one leave because they have a better offer or opputuninity I be happy and sad all at the same time!
good,I learned time management skills. I learned to operate a pallet jack and other retail equipment.
good,"Walmart is not the best place to work in especially of you are a student or a stay at home mom, the company doesn't provide a good open door policy in which you can interact and express yourself with management"
good,"A typical day at work starts with morning meeting all associates to outline tasks for the day. I've learn that it takes  team work to accomplish tasks and that you alone cannot perform them all you must learn to delegate. I have learn that management cannot micro-manage, but can preform frequent follow up tours. Your co-workers are watching you at all times so make sure your treating all associate fairly and with respect and that you will not delegate a task that you yourself will not preform. The hardest part on my job was tracking inventory and making sure all items are replenish on the salesfloor. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people each day, training new associates and most of all at the end of your shift all of your task was completed leaving everything ready for the next shift to take over making their task easier."
good,this was my high school job. wasn't something I loved but I got some really good experience from it.
good,"work in recieving ang unloading item from trucks, like with my co worker."
good,"overall its walmart they have enough money to hire as many people as they need but in set they want to under staff the cashiers so we are stuck with lines across the store, they dont care about putting you on christmas eve and new years day. if you were there long enough then the benefits are pretty good and there is opportunity to become manager."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my job, but I didn't like the management at my particular store, they made the situation a lot worse than it should of been."
good,Typical day was spent making customers happy and checking them out. Work pace was expected to be speedy and correct. I learned that in order for business to be speedy and correct everyone must work together. Some of the management crew were very helpful and hard working. Hardest part of the job was trying to get the whole store in order on a very short deadline. Most enjoyable part was the way the whole store would work together to get the job done.
good,"Typical work schedule from 4:00 pm to 1:00 AM. I've learned Inventory, how to round up freight, and place them in their correct departments. Leaned how to operate fork lift, electric pallet jack, and electric stack. I learned how to operate a 960 scan gun, and learn how to scan for missing items. The store manager was great, and she did everything she was required to do, it was just the assistant managers. They would go against her authority, when she wasn't around, and throw more work on us than was required."
good,The only thing I think is that walmart does not pay their employees enough for the job they do
good,"running a department in the store, ordering, inventory, scheduling, plan o grams, stocking, handling customer requests. I learned to handle my own department.  Management was typical what benefits me and not the company.  Co workers were unreliable and rude. Hardest part of this job was keeping inventory clean and picked up.  Most enjoyable apart was helping people."
good,"Change oil, batteries, tires, etc..."
good,"Since I have had prior experience as a cashier, they did raise my pay a little bit. When I first got there, I was told that I would be working the customer service desk, which meant more work and dealing with more irate customers for the same amount of pay as a cashier. When it was time for me to leave to go to school I put in a transfer request to a different store closer to the school I was going to. I put the request in months before leaving and a week before I left my information was just getting transfered to the store, by then there were no positions open. I had to leave the store I was at due to not having my request approved, when I tried to come back to the store, I was given the runaround by the managers there, even though I haven't had any disciplinary issues or write-ups the year and a half I was at the store. Also my prior experience working there didn't help with me getting my job back."
good,"Atendimento ao cliente, aprendi a trabalhar em equipe, a gerência boa, relacionamento com colegas de trabalho boa."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart would involve swiping into the system and then heading off to the customer service desk. During each shift I'd get a wide range of customers in every type of mood imaginable. I learned how to de-escalate tense situations and how to calmly problem-solve with tense customers."
good,The workday is pretty routine as long as you have a good team the day goes by pretty fast. Only thing is its no real job security..fire you and hire some one else the next day.
good,"Normal day, simply come in and work the register or customer service desk.  Learned how to deal with people more, and to be careful.  Walmart was quick to point fingers, instead of giving employees the benefit of the doubt.  coworkers were great, of course there is always little bickerings but, for most part easy to get along with people.  Dealing with people was the most enjoyable part of this job!"
good,"Typical day consisted of sweeping, scrubbing and waxing the floors through out the store. The trouble came when there was too much inventory and the managers did not plan enough people on the schedule. They would pull the floor personnel and then held us to the fast paced standard that the regular stockers were held to.  I asked for a transfer to a closer store and was denied, I finally had to choose between this employment and going to nursing school. I decided nursing school was a better option for me."
good,"Personally, I didn't enjoy Walmart. Customers had the tendency to be rude despite the smile and genuine greeting from me. Standing at a cash register ruined my spine and I wound up with disk issues. CSM's have the tendency to be late when giving breaks."
good,"every day was a typical day at work when i was up there at walmart being there put a frown on my face. bad management , disrespectful co - workers... the hardest part of the job was dealing with the co workers"
good,I actually enjoyed my work there i just left because i joined the United States Air Force
good,I learned to work in a place where there wasn't a lot of advancement or team work and it taught me to adjust and to be able to make a tough situation work for me.
good,Low pay and treated poorly people are good to work with and you meet a variety of customers
good,"Hard , Diligent work in a steady environment "
good,"Learning to communicate with other as well as the customers. Assisting them, and let them know some info of the objects they are looking for."
good,"É uma boa empresa mas nem sempre cumpri o seus horários, é tranquilo apesar de ser agitado, aprendi que dentro da empresa se tem que pensar mais em si mesma pois vai ter sempre um querendo estar a sua frente mais nunca deixa de ajudar, apesar de ser muito na minha tinha um bom relacionamento com os colegas ,eu estava la pra trabalhar"
good,"I worked over nights, so my job started at 10pm. Sign in for a telson and printer. My job was to pick merchandise from the bins from 10pm to 3am out of bins, freezers and coolers. I always help customers on the floor and managers also had me doing other things at the same time doing my picks which is over 800 picks per night. I also help and manage the 4pm to 1am backroom team organize and set up back room with all the over stock freight on the general merchandise side. I took the pallets down with the electric pallet jack. After I finish my side of picks, I would go on the Grocery side to help finish their picks. After lunch, we had over 100 overstock pallets we had to put back in the backroom on General merchandise side of the store and bin what we could into the bins and I would go on Grocery side and bin it all up before we could go home which most of the time it was after 9am.  What I learn is you have to respect others as human beings not a machine. Management needs to appreciate their employees for the hard and demanding work they do and we do our best! They need to help us at times when the demand is so much and quit calling employees in the office on production, when everyone is working as fast and hard as we can. My co workers was the best, we support each other at work and bad times! The hardest part of my job is I am a hard worker, fast pace and team player. It took a toll on my body, not sleeping, eating, stress and how the managers was treating us without respect or thanking us or how negative they were, nothing positive.  When it was a good time to work their,"
good,Typical day at work is a normally steady. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customers smile.
good,"well there wasnt much to learn in this job only to memorize were some things went in which aisle that is pretty much about it. I didn't like how some of the managers let some co workers slide with things that they shouldnt be doing or with just stuff that they did not finish. They had favorites and I disliked that the most out of everything. Besides that I actually like unloading the trucks and loading everyone's cart to their aisles they were assigned i just like the heavy work and I always made sure everything was left clean I dont like a messy area. Co workers I tried to get along with everyone so I wouldnt have any trouble with no one, I dislike drama and dont want any trouble so majority at times I avoided co workers to be left alone."
good,"I have a few things. 1 they like to schedule me to work till11-12 at night then come in at 8-9am. or the fact i live 20 miles away and they have me come in for 4 hr shifts 3 times a week. The best thing about it is the customers, I have a bunch that specifically come to me."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of making sure the store was always well stocked and presentable to our guests. Sales associates had that duty, along with making sure the guests were assisted in any way possible with finding what they were looking for. I learned a lot from working at Walmart, both about myself and big name company stores. I realized that i need to be in a fast paced workplace or at least somewhere were work will be constant. I'm not too fond of standing around. As for what i learned about big company stores? They cannot function properly without the associates and there teamwork, you fellow co-workers have to be your teammates and communication is key. The hardest part of my job was the way the management was set up. Instructions were not properly passed down because the mangers would have associates sometimes doing there jobs for them. It caused confusion. I enjoyed working at walmart because it gave me the constant work i needed out of a job."
good,"i enjoy helping customers,and learning more about management."
good,My experience with Walmart wasn't that bad. It was my first job a little rough to start off. the only problem I had was with a manager. she didn't like me much and told me that I needed to pick what was more important my daughter or the job?. At that time my daughter was sick I had to leave work early and so I said my daughter and I left. I did however go back the store manager called me and said for me to go back and that manager did get tranfered to another store.
good,Loved knowing the facts about whats coming new to walmart. It was a joy unpackaging and hanging clothes.
good,"I learned about the optician practice. How to order, dispense glasses."
good,"management only looked out for themselves, many hours given when needed but a day off especially on the weekend is almost impossible"
good,"I clock-in for my shift. I count the podium to make sure the money is balanced. I check my palm-pilot to make sure my associates are caught up on their breaks/meals. Then, I immediately begin assisting customers with their needs. My co-workers for the most part are nice,but we're aren't always on the same page due to being told different things by management. Management doesn't really interact with customers unless a customer asks for them or has a complaint. The hardest part of the job is walking in to an unorganized place and having to figure out what is going on. The most enjoyable part about the job is being able to assist customers and seeing a smile on their faces after you have helped them."
good,es una empresa con buen poryecto lo unico era el mal salario y falta de herramientas de seguridad
good,"cashing out customers "
good,"typical day would start with cleaning the shop sweeping, mopping, organizing and restocking supplies, service of customers cars was made simple each tech had there own job to preform making for a smooth work day."
good,"A typical day at work is having the ability to put a smile on a customers face ,which I look forward to everyday.I learned that customers really appreciate good customer service,especially friendly associates.Sometimes,management will let you know how great of a job you're doing and if they don't,it doesn't necessarily mean that they do not notice.I enjoy team work with my co-workers,I get along well with others dispite our differences.The hardest part of the job is trying to finish a job given to me almost at the end of my schedule time,because I always love giving my best at whatever task is giving to me.The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure customers leave with a smile upon their face."
good,"Working nights has been a unique experience for me. We would stock shelves with new merchandise. Pull our pallets out of receiving. Some managers are more strict then others but are tolerable. My co-workers shared the same idea as me. ""Lets get this done and done right the first time"" all while staying friendly. The hardest part of my job was the time frame that we were given. So much inventory and not enough time to finish. We were short-staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the team."
good,"The day generally starts with our understaffed electronics department getting bombarded with carts of merchandise from the backroom. When we get a good rhythm going of working these carts we are told to take care of customer orders. while we are in the middle of taking care of the customers orders we are then told to cut fabric or work over in the photo area. Often times a single associate is left possessing all three major sets of keys (Electronics, Photo, Sporting goods) even though we are not sporting goods associates."
good,"worked 3rd shift, low pay for work performed, interfered with my family life, because of 3rd shift"
good,a typical day working at wal-mart i would say is different each day. some days you will have good days and some you will have bad. but you dont let neither affect your job performance.
good,"The day begins really slowly, usually. Then all of a sudden theres a rush and you have to satisfy a large number of angry customers at one time. Ive learn to work under pressure and satisfy customers. Management is good, except with breaks or change during the rush. Co-workers are fine, everyone gets along. I enjoy when I get to work on the floor with customers rather than at the cash register."
good,"Working for WalMart had its ups and downs.  An employee would have to learn every detail in their department so that they would be able to do everyone's job along with their own.  Doing so would allow an employee to continue learning but would also put more pressure on them.  Majority of my co-workers were very sweet and outgoing whilst others were quiet and kept to themselves."
good,If you like to pull freight and stock shelves at night then I would recommend this job.
good,"The  individuals you work along side as peers are great people with good hearts.  Low moral with senior management and cultural politics is difficult for management to deal with daily."
good,"A typical day at work was generally pretty busy. Around 12-2 pm we were pretty busy and 5-7pm. I started working in TLE in December of 2012 with absolutely no work experience, let alone experience with vehicles. Within a month or so I was almost completely trained, my supervisor always remarked on how fast I catch on. I learned how to change oil (diesel and regular), test/charge/replace batteries, repair/rotate/replace tires, I became register trained to cover for other associates when they were not available, I also stocked shelves when business was slow and always kept busy. I loved my coworkers, we all worked great together, and even though I don't work there anymore, I do frequently go to visit them. The hardest part of the job was definitely the customers. But then there were the customers who made my job very enjoyable. I always made the customers happiness a big priority in my work day."
good,"gostei muito de trabalhar no walmart "
good,"As management in this Retail atmosphere, it was stressful and"
good,"-A typical day at work would be clocking in and finding out what your task were for that particular day. "
good,"A typical day in the unloading area included, your job being threatned for everyhting you did and also being yelled at when asking a question about how to properly do something. mamagement was poor, co workers were great"
good,helping customers all day and making sure things are stocked properly
good,"stocked items and loaded and unloaded trucks,drove forklift"
good,"On a typical day, I review reports to identify theft in the building. I review both internal and external theft on a daily basis.  I travel to other stores in the Market to identify theft and to conduct internal investigation interviews.  I continue to reduce accident costs in the building by being pro active in associate engagement.  I have created and implimented plans to reduce shrink. I supervised a group of five people.  I wrote schedules, I was in charge of teaching and training them to further their career and I evaluate their progress.  The hardest part of my job is knowing that advancement oppertunitiues are limited. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I am making an impact on the business."
good,I learned how to lead at wal mart. but its not for a man to make a living. Good for a kid to have employment threw school.
good,"opening cash drawer, checking and restocking shelves, you learn real fast in dealing with people, management was a little demanding.  As co-workers they're were really great to get along with. The hardest part I would say, was doing things that weren't required on the description of employment cleaning a vacant building, a little construction which was not on the description of employment.  Needed the job but, was happy to clock out!"
good,"ok co-workers, dealing with a variety of people, hardest part is picking up[ other people slack"
good,"I have learned how to kind of take a step back, and realize my potential. The hardest part of my job is motivating my associates. I feel like they just don't have the desire to work. I get the most joy from my job, when I have an elderly customer that cant find in item, and I take them to it, and they are so thankful. I learn a lot about people that way, when you are helpful they confide in you and tell you about their families, or problems.  just by talking to someone they fell validated."
good,"Typical day at work was managing the backroom, inventory, sales helping customers on the sales floor. Management was bad as in helping in my work position or personal information. Co workers were pretty nice until they didn't get what they wanted. I didn't think it was a hard part of my job but I did like being around some co workers who taught me ."
good,a typical day  at Walmart is very busy but busy is good because it kills time i learned lots of new thing while working at Walmart like processing hunting and fishing licences..lol  management was cool i guess i loved working with me front end  manager and some of my co workers  but only the ones who pulled there weight the hardest part of the job was sometime being overwhelmed with stuff that had no place to go and the most enjoyable part was meeting  new people and getting to help those who need help just being apart of the Walmart experience was enjoyable!!
good,It is a company where you have to work hard for little pay. I would not recommend people work there if they don't like to work.
good,"This job offered many benefits such as discounts on groceries, Sam's club membership, education discounts and others.  I received the employee of the month after working for four months.  The work was not very challenging. The shift took a toll on my health after several months, especially because my days were scheduled with long gaps so it was never consistent.  I enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,Every moment is unpredictable. Always be ready to switch gears and any moment.
good,"Worked a set schedule, management was poor, co-workers were fun to work with, enjoyable part about this job was the customers."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart includes zoning your shelfs, which means pulling the items forward and making sure all the items are in the right place. After that you stock the selfs and the back room. You repeat this process over and over. I learned how to inventory items with the computer scanner, other than that everything was self explanatory. The management was good. They were on top of things most the time and would listen to requests or opinions. The co-workers varied in terms of helpfulness. Some would be a great help and things went by quickly, while others were lazy and work went by slow. On the whole the co-workers were good. The hardest part of the job would be stocking items in the freezer. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working in the holidays season because there are a lot of things that need to get done, so you would end up woking in multiple parts of the store."
good,"Good co-workers, but bad management. Management changes every 6 months and you never know who will be over your department."
good,i did enjoy the people that i worked with at Walmart the  employees were nice the store was neat an the customers were nice too.
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart.  Retired after 26 years. I learned a great deal over the years.
good,its a good job for those who are just starting out or over. Its hard to get fulltime hours. pretty much no benefits.
good,Walmart is a great place to work as you further your education or look to improve your lifestyle from where it is now.
good,No benefits until you have been there a year.  Always a threat of being laid off.  Can be stressful without much support.  You have to fight for time off.
good,"During my time involved with Wal-Mart, the job came as part of my daily routine.  I went to work at 4, started unloading a truck, went to lunch when it was finished, then hauled all the freight to the proper departments.  My team was a group of amazing guys, always willing to lend a hand.  As for the ""management"", and I use this term lightly, they were less than helpful in any way, shape, or form.  I did develop a keen sense for memorization while working with the company, and improved on my physical strength.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with a member of the management team who refused to do anything, and was always complaining about something, regardless of the day.  The most enjoyable part?  I would have to say meeting the team that I got to work with, and spending time around them.  They all were always laughing and joking, but never failed to get the job done."
good,I liked this job until I had complications with  my pregnacy and they fired me
good,walmart taught me a lot about working and dealing with different types of people
good,you meet a lot of people and i love people so it was nice. management sometimes asks for a lot but that was fine cause i enjoy working hard
good,ok to get by..pay was not very good and hours need to be cut sometimes
good,"The management could be a bit better, but I'd say that I overall enjoyed my experience here."
good,Ok for low pay - co-workers are an equal mix of nice hard workers and some slackers just like every place. Management is ok. Hardest part is working alone when it's busy.
good,"los dias en la empresa son todos iguales es un trabajo de forma mecanica y facil, la atencion al cliente es de persona a persona, aprendi que todo lo que una cree saber no es mas que una simple y baga idea de lo que realmente es, aprendi la diferencia entre aptitud y actitud, la gerencia o jefes inmediatos todos tienen una idea diferente del trabajo y fue dificil realizar las tareas de cierto modo que a los 2 jefes les convenciera y dieran una opinion favorable a mi trabajo, pero al fin lo logre, el trabajo en equipo fue bueno la forma de organizarnos entre nosotros y dividirnos las tareas entre todos fue muy buena, y la parte mas dificil fue el tener que decir adios y dejar el trabajo. lo que mas me gusto fue el numero de personas que conoci y los amigos que hasta ahora conservo y que realmente me gusta lo que hacia en la empresa."
good,"The day begins with a morning tour of the facility to identify opportunities in merchandise security, safety hazards/violations, and general ""in-stock"" standards. Daily meetings with store side management are very productive and informative. The store has a well thought out work structure that I would carry with me to any future place of business. Fellow management is very driven and passionate about achieving goals. The hardest part of the job would be working on scheduled days off. I do enjoy the daily interaction with my staff and store side associates as well. They are a very positive and upbeat group."
good,"Working at Walmart encourages and expects all individuals to work to their maximum potential and push for more. The culture of Walmart is unique and the co-workers are great.  "
good,Great company to work for...I only quit because my ex-husband wanted to move to MS.
good,A typical day at work would include ten pleasant customers out of 500. Our customer service managers were always backed up so alot would fall on the cashiers.
good,"*Project filled work day with constant customer service."
good,"The people you work with are amazing for the most part, and some of the management staff are great, but it is very difficult to get any help from management is there is an issue that need resolving.  Priorities are also not where they should be with most of the staff."
good,"Working for walmart was a fast pace job my team and I had to unload trucks in a timely manner to keep the flow of product in store, hardest part is lifting a lot of heavy weight for long periods of time, most enjoyable was my team we worked very well together."
good,I've learned in an working environment how to engage in great conversation with customers and build a friendship. With doing this you are able to provide great customer service and it makes your job easier by doing your job  and satisfying customer.
good,"A typical day at work includes daily paperwork, patient calls, checking in shipments of eyeglass and contact orders as well as supplies needed. Intercepting for new patients is a huge part of the job. I learned many new skills including optical skills such as reading lenses and which lenses would be best based on the prescription.  I also learned about patient privacy laws and HIPAA. "
good,"Excellent place to work, to organize and lead a team, to implement sales operations to meet customer's needs and enjoy and celebrate success with the team."
good,I really enjoy working at Wal-Mart.  I get the chance to meet tons of different people that I may never meet in a normal setting.  It is a fun environment and most of the management is great.  My only problem is I do not get enough hours.  I communte over 40 miles per day and it is getting to the point that it is not worth it for me to go to work on the few days I am scheduled.  I hate to give it up but I have to do what is best for me.
good,"At Walmart, I learned how to be sensitive to the needs of different people and how to work under strenuous conditions.Walmart taught me how to be efficient and quick when servicing large groups of people of all backgrounds. My customer service skills were founded at this company and molded for management potential."
good,"Learn new things every day. Advancement is really not available and pretty well hard to get on full time. As for the work itself, love it just feel that the shift that I am on is underpaid for the workload they put on us."
good,Not a huge fan of retail work. Shift work was not great. Glad i don't work there anymore.
good,I enjoyed most of my co-workers however I disagree with how some things are done inside of management.
good,I had a lot of fun working at Walmart. I learned a lot of different jobs and met a lot of awesome people. I can't say that the work hours were wonderful because they were not. You also don't make a lot of money working there. I did like the fact that you could move up the ladder in the workplace. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was the customer service part of it. It is hard to please every single person you come across. My coworkers were always willing to give a hand if needed. The management was good at times and not so good at times. They got moved around a lot. So it was hard to get to know them. They all knew what they were doing. Just have to say miss the people and loved the knowledge I took away from working at Walmart.
good,"Although your workload is a bit much at times I worked"
good,"Really friendly coworkers and managers. Strict on health codes and following procedures, which is a good thing. I loved it as a student in high-school it was a great job but not very good on raises and full time."
good,"I worked at Wal-Mart for nearly 4 years and I never had the troubles I encountered when I arrived at Taylor, PA location. The management would give you so many things that with an entire crew you couldn't get it done in a work week, and that was just your list for one day. None of the management had ever worked on the sales floor, and expected too much from their employees. Myself and half a dozen of my co workers all lost our jobs in the same time, because of management who simply did not understand. I loved this job at the other locations I worked, and I would recommend it."
good,"Great at first but unless your not use to a night job its rough on your body after month.  The hardest thing to get use to is management switch up and getting use to how things are run for each manager. There are favorites with this job. Some co-works will help you with your job if your behind if your friends with them, others will let you fend for yourself. Days you work and your off days always change unsuspectingly even if you checked it before left. Mangagers do praise you for doing a good job but instead tell you why you dont already have it done. The most enjoyable part was working alone, and lunch breaks."
good,"I stocked shelves mostly, and assisted the customers in finding what they needed. I did price and on hand changes. I learned how to use a hand held telxon to work the inventory. I loved my co-worker, we were like family. The hardest part of the job was that every manager was different, so one would ask you to do something one way, then another one would come along and ask you to do it another way. The most enjoyable part of the day was setting up displays. I really enjoyed the projects."
good,This is a good company to work for but when you work with individuals that already have their inner circle established you will never be able to feel like part of the company and you can't approach management with a problem because they will always take up for the other party.
good,"Start the night an hour before the associates arrive. Take 24*7 sheet and personally record the skids on sales floor."
good,"I learned just how creative I could be, and Wal-Mart allowed me to do so while decorating cakes. Very rewarding."
good,"Busy non-stop, learned how to move at a faster pase as management you needed to be everywhere at once. Co-Workers some didn't show as much dedication, so it would be harder to complete tasks assigned with no team work. Enjoyable part of my job there was meeting new people and going home at the end of your shift."
good,working at walmart is okay. the job requires a lot of time and patience .
good,"They gave me a job in a time of need, but they are not giving any hours even when you let your manager know that you are willing to work more."
good,"My days were always different, I ran the cash register, worked in the layaway dept. the courtesy desk. Assisted customers daily. I worked with every department manager,  I worked in the claims area, I was responsible for returning all damaged merchandise back to the proper companies. I kept track of all paperwork during the process, and I was responsible for keeping a clean, safe, and manageable work area."
good,"Walmart at this time I was in college and it really served its purpose, and the managers really worked with my school schedule"
good,"Learned the most on how to handle customers over the phone and build great communications skills along with handling customer complaints and returned items. Everyone was polite, but many were complaining about the lack of pay."
good,"They expect you to do any and everything even if its not your job or apart of your job description"
good,"My typical day at work could involve many different projects. One does not know exactly what is going to happen. For sure their will be meeting customer needs while juggling store duties. My co-workers tend to be helpful and courteous, while management can get confused on who is doing what for what reason. I would say this is the hardest part of the job as well as sorting out what is most important job to be performing to be the most productive. We have many parties when the store does well, and it is fun to socialize with the many people who come into the store."
good,"Walmart puts itself out to the public as a family oriented business who truly cares about their associates but after working there for 14 years I saw it more as Walmart is only out for the money and really doesn't give their associates the credit they deserve. Without all those hard workers, there would not be a company. I believe their associates are underpaid for the amount of work that is expected of them . Bonuses were given to employees on a quarterly basis depending on how well your store's profit was. If it was low, then sometimes there would be no bonus and employees were expected to do more to increase sales. Management always got there bonuses   regardless. The employees are the ones doing all the work and management were the ones reaping all the benefits."
good,A typical day in Wal Mart seeing different faces each day dealing with the public and different cultures. You learn how to remain head strong with dealing with the public. I enjoy what I do especially when I can solve a problem for a customer to getting things done properly and in a timely manner.
good,going into work zone your area take care of custmers talk to other employees
good,Definitely not a career job. If you cant keep up with production you will find yourself out of a job. Not a bad job for someone out of high school and it affords time to pursue school.
good,"I worked in the produce department at WalMart. While i enjoyed my job and the customer service i was able to offer, the upper management needs a lot of improvement. They have a huge gap in their communication with other managers and co workers. The set unrealistic goals for us to obtain and wanted work done without offering the proper support. I enjoyed helping customers picking out fruit/vegetables and providing them with feedback on how to prepare the item."
good,"I had many customers that I liked at Walmart and worked with a good team.  However, there are downsides.  The security staff watches employees with many cameras, especially in the pharmacy.  There are 11 cameras in each pharmacy and management and security watches you.  "
good,"typical day at work: no talking only work, get the job done, go home"
good,what can you really say........worked night not that many people ;;;;;;;
good,"A typical day working at Walmart is ok. It has it's moments with the screaming kids and the adults acting crazy sometimes. I like it when it's real busy cause it makes the day go by faster. Since I have been there I've learned how to do special orders for customers, and how to put data in the computer, and change batteries in watches and do watch bands.The management is ok too for the most part they are pretty nice. The co=workers are pretty nice too and most of them are fun to work with. The hardest part about the job is that the rules keep changing day by day. They tell you to do one thing then turn around and tell you to do another. Sometimes the rules get confusing. The most enjoyable thing about working at Walmart is meeting new people everyday and trying to make customers happy.When I know that I made a customer happy it makes me happy. That tells me I did my job correctly."
good,dealing with walmart costumers sometimes can be hard.Some are mean and treat you like dirt cause you work there
good,"On a typical day I stocked one or  two areas in the store and stored the overstock merchandise in the backroom. I learned proper merchandising and retail planning. My coworkers created a nice work environment. Most of the management team was honest and fair, however everyone in management should not have been in the position. The benefits were fair but the pay rate was low. There was nothing really hard about the job and I really enjoyed dealing with the customers."
good,Walmart is a nice place to work for but they can adhere to their employees with more respect and better growth advancement.
good,"Empresa multinacional, enorme mais com metodos e administardores a moda antiga."
good,"a typical day is great with customers, but you are constantly harassed by management. not very customer oriented at all. co-workers are usually agreeable. i liked learning about the systems used. most enjoyable day is helping customers."
good,Friendly attitude draws friendly customers. The more talkative ones really made my day!
good,"Walmart is OK. I met some awesome people there. My Job was restocking produce. I earned the produce business. Management was OK. Was mostly allowed to work independently which I very much appreciated. Hardest part of the job was to accept the low pay rate, otherwise it was not so hard. Had quite a bit of freedom so it was a good job for the season I was there."
good,Coworkers were normally easy to get along with. the work was never that bad at all. I learned to deal with costumers. Hardest part of job was dealing with a busy open store as you stocked freight.
good,"Get our assignments for the day and get to work."
good,"As long as you do your job management is not a problem. They do not run a charity so show up and do your job and don't slack. People always trash Walmart, probably people who have never worked there, and I feel that is unfair. Its not the best job but there are worse retail jobs and there are advancement opportunities for motivated individuals."
good,Processing money and making sure all things are accounted for. The store always looks bad because of a lot returns and lack of people to process them. Management does not really give any support except for the things they want done while everything else suffers. People are constantly quitting or getting transferred to better stores. I have learned the handling money and how to be very thorough.
good,"A typical day at work would normally start at 5:30 am . I would set up 22 registers and 4 service desk registers for opening time 6 am. Made sure everything was up and running, by everything I mean the 5 bathrooms, bottle recycling room, ATM's, doors, and of course the registers. In addition, I had to organize and take back all the merchandise that customers left around the store, we called that overstock and zoning. Throughout the day I attended to customer needs and associate concerns and managers to do list, all while making sure the bathrooms stay clean and every one performed their duties to the best of their abilities. Also, I needed to make sure everyone took their breaks on time and assign them registers. What I learned from Walmart was to delegate tasks more effectively. I always stressed about doing it all until my supervisor explained to me the delegating concept, things ran much smoother for me after that. I love customer service so that's what I enjoyed the most. Being able to help customers find what they came for and putting a smile on there face meant my job was done. Upper Management, well some of them were nice but others in my opinion need to go back to school and learn some basic people skills."
good,i enjoy working with the people i do work with with the exception of some of the management team and politics.
good,I clean up the maintenance closets stock my carts check the restrooms do a safety sweep in the main isles and then get my list of special jobs for the day from management. Then give out the job task to other associates as they came in to work. How to work for multiple managers at the same time. There are a lot of managers all with task for maintenance in different areas. The co-workers most of them are a pleasure to work with. The hardest thing is taking out the bottles and cans they are not pleasant but I get it done. The best part is the bonus checks every three months and the customers.
good,"a typical day at work at this company consists of a start up meeting & then unloading as many trailers as possible in a shift.  I learned that management is always talking about safety in the warehouse."
good,"A typical day for me. I would monitor the store either on the sales floor or cctv. My job was to make sure the store was safe from accidents, as well as making sure there was no theft."
good,"I changed floor sets, completed price changes, as well as day to day activities. I managed a small staff of three associates."
good,Short staff on over night. Come in the next day and store looks a mess. Co-workers are upset now they to have stock the floor cause it was not done from overnight. Jump in and start stocking the floors. Our customers are what matters. They do not care who is at fault just that their needs are taking care of. Fun to watch and see co-workers change right in front of your eyes. Frowns turns smile and the day is a success.
good,Work day started with meeting covering safety and policy procedures. From there started working on equipment in shop or responding to calls from other departments. The rest of day was divided between preventive maintenance and corrective work.
good,"Working at Walmart consisted of anything I was asked to do; I worked the toy, stationary, and health and beauty departments. I also filled in at customer service and cashiering as well as unloading trucks to fill inventory. I learned what it was like to keep up with a high volume store that was constantly busy. There is never down time in such a place. The management pushed me to work in areas to expand my skills, and my co-workers were cooperative. The most difficult part of the job was keeping up with zoning during the busy season (ex: Christmas and back to school season) The most enjoyable part of the job was learning experiences I came across on a daily basis."
good,"The hours varied day to day. The employees work schedules were made up to 3 weeks in advance. If a day off was needed at anytime during these weeks it would not be granted. To request a day off the notice had to be submitted at least 6 weeks in advance. "
good,I worked at walmart for a year. I had some family issues that couldn't be avoided and the manager was gone on vacation so i had to deal with the ast store manager i told him i had already spoken to the manager and he was OK with everything..told me i just needed to submit for time off and have it signed so i could take 2 weeks off and the guy got mad and tried to fire me...so i quit
good,"I worked as a cashier for 8 and a half years, I learned great customer service skills working there.  Management was always on my case about something stupid.  My co-workers or fellow cashiers rocked.  The hardest part of my job was getting more hours when i was already part time.  The most enjoyable part of my job were helping the customers"
good,Got training in different departments. I got the chance to operate the men's department as a department manager.
good,"•	Supervised and Directed Department Associates."
good,"Worked for Walmart long enough to get to benefits availability. But due to an injury sustained by another employee, I was systematically attacked by management as their workmans compensation company sent me to a bogus doctor and then wouldn't get me scheduled to see a real doctor. Long story short, left me with a dislike of the company altogether."
good,I liked interacting with all the different types of consumers that made this store their shopping destination. The management could be a little more organized though.
good,"I absolutely loved my coworkers that I had at Walmart, and when you pass the 90 probationary period the benefits included in employment is definitely awesome. Its a shame that is where it stops. Walmart management is a little in disrepair."
good,"My day consisted of assigning each cashier to a register, changing the cash register over at midnight. I would address the problems of each cashier and customer."
good,"A typical day at work would involve clocking in, going to a register, getting a break every two hours or so which was beneficial. On average, I work about 7 hours a day. It is difficult to get a full time position. My favorite part of the job was my coworkers. They are comical and fairly easy to get along with which made the stressful days easier. Hardest part of the job was standing a lot of the time and dealing with frustrated customers.  My work place is about a 30 minute drive from where I live which made things a bit difficult."
good,"I applied for a job here to secure some type of income before my husband and I could move to the area. Only been here a year and already desperate for a new job. There's a very diverse group of people working at this store, but that's one of very few positives. Training is erratic and inconsistent, very hard to get things done due to counter-productive policies, and important information regarding benefits and procedures has to be scavenged from whomever happens to be around."
good,management was the best part about my job. they were some of the nicest people that would do anything to help you. my co workers all would help each other out if needed. i really enjoyed working with such great people!
good,Customers came 1st. Inventory loss prevention and  replenishment. Train new hires on customer relations. I did everything from handle the keys to high dollar inventory to cell phone contracts.
good,"Ran photo lab department.  Ordered supplies, processed pictures.  Hired and let go people in department."
good,There was always something to do but the employees were rude
good,"great place to work in some area I learned a lot as far as shipping freight from D.C. to surrounding stores, learned more on order filler and forklift operations loading and unloading freight using RF scanner"
good,Es un empresa solvente capaz de ofrecer empleo a muchas familias mexicanas.
good,"Working for WalMart has really been a great experience, getting to know customers on a first name basis and providing assistance for them when needed. I really get a great satisfaction out of helping customers. My co-workers became my family."
good,"Walmart was a great place to work 20 years ago.  The customer was the most important thing.  "
good,"*A Typical Day At Work Was Sometimes Stressful But Learning To Cope With The Issues In Everyday Life Is Something Walmart Taught Me, All Though The Management Sometimes Become Annoying, I Learned That They Are Only Doing Their Job As Well. My Co-workers Were Always Friendly And Never Had Issues With Them. The Hardest Part Of The Job Was Not Being Able To Understand Some Of The Costumers, The Most Enjoyable Part Was When You Just Get That One Person in Your Line That Makes Your Day!"
good,"... Mediocre place to work, especially if you are (too) strong-willed, and unable to work with lack-lustre management. Also, when dealing with HR etc, it's a catch 22-- the less you talk to them, the less they help you... and the more you talk to them, the less they help you. They play the ""we're here for our employees"" role, but they're all about the numbers and satisfaction of the customers, not the well-being of their employees"
good,Fellow Employees were awesome but management was horrible. Poor management communication and failure to follow company policies.
good,Too fast and way too demanding and far too few people to accomplish our daily goals
good,"I enjoyed it there, really long hour shifts lots of standing had to get use too"
good,The people their work hard. They do their do best at good performance and working with others. I forgive my last coworkers for whatever were their week points. On the deep end Wall-Mart has great skills and is a lot different than it is thought out to be.
good,Ok part-time job for a teen/ college student. Easy work. Just have to deal with upper management that isn't always pleasant .
good,"Not a lot of help . long hours too."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart started by clocking in in the back, then proceeding to the front to scan my badge in order to find out what register to log into. After that, you would stand there, interact with customers and scan merchandise. "
good,A typical day would basically be they move you around a lot and put you in places that they SHOULD pay you higher with but won't because they want to save. Managers are nice and most of the associates are nice just not worth your time if you're looking for a job with good benefits and pay.
good,I loved my job with Wal-Mart. I learned what it truly was to have customer service. I felt accomplished knowing that I helped people with their health and made a difference when I left work at night. I absolutly love the pharmacy field. I never thought I would feel this passionate about a career.
good,"there are opportunities in the company but you have to stick it out for over 10 years before even considered for any management position, full time is 34 hours, part time is between 12-32 hours"
good,"Its very fun to work for walmart but they dont pay much"
good,"I enjoy that it is fast pace and busy, however, all areas within the store are constantly short-handed. The communication between all levels of management is lacking and inconsistent."
good,"Wal-Mart is instrumental in terms of learning respect for the individual, service to customer and striving for excellence and this view is subjective."
good,In my personal opinion  you can work with some of management at my store. Also security is a big issues that's not being addressed properly.
good,"No Benefits no full time just part time...."

good,"Aprendí manejo de pos y posnet."
good,great work evironment if you have people thats gone come to work
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was serving the community. There  were too many managers and not enough employees. Low pay.
good,"Usually we worked at a steady pace. I was friends with a lot of people there, made some great friends. Management was very strict and made new rules almost every month that we would have to learn. The hardest part of the job was I almost never had a home life, but the most enjoyable part was getting to work the customer service desk."
good,The management wasn't the best and they treated most of the employee's with a lack of respect.
good,"As an electronic and wireless sales associate working mid and second shift is all about stocking, cleaning and selling. At the Turkeycreek store a typical day in this roll can be hard and discouraging. The freight that comes in for third shift is pushed to the back by the morning shift due to the morning shift department manager taking all but one or two associates to the back for “cleaning, inventory, picks and whatever they can do to stay off the floor.” Picks are done in the morning where the department manager, with their “help,” scan the department for items on the shelves that are low and go in the back to pick them from the bins and roll it out to the floor for the morning associates to put up.  This is also where most of the cleaning and setting up displays are performed.  Around 11am the directs arrive to be checked in. directs are the boxes of movies, music, games, MP3 Players, cards and other items. Remember there is only one or two associates out on the floor doing all this. At 11am morning shift associates begins lunches. A mid shift associate comes in around this time and then they roll out the freight from the previous night. All stocking should be done by 5pm and then your focus is on selling and cleaning. However, this is not the case… freight and directs are still being put out up to late night, around 9 or 10 at night. The reason, not only it is a lot of merchandise, but throughout the day you have to pick up and put away returns, talk to customers, sale and do the site to store. Site to store allows customers to go on the Wal-Mart website and pick what they"

good,Getting the carts in the bay without machine & dealing with most of their rules
good,"I started a cashier within a year I became a CSM. Long hours,busy and enjoyed the older cashiers."
good,"Typically you would see what shape the cooler and floor was in and prioritize.  At times, it can be over whelming and learned to look at the whole picture and break it up and work with co-workers to get the tasks at hand accomplished.  "
good,I enjoy the people I meet at the store and majority of my co-workers. Some of the managers are great at their profession.
good,"I loved interacting with new people each and everyday. The store never really got ""slow"" so there was little down time."
good,looking for a job that helps with the bills this place is great. 
good,"a typical day at work would include filling prescriptions for customer and working with insurance companies when problems would arise.  stocking the counters and ringing up customer purchases.  "
good,A typical day at work was to use organizational skills to clean and keep shelves stocked and ordered. The Management team changed several times annually to keep management updated and knowledgeable about the areas they managed in the store. The job was enjoyable however not something I particularly see myself starting a career with. The most enjoyable part of the job was the happy customers and staff.  
good,"nice place to work,help other dept and work as a team environment,some parts of the store have bad management if you don't do your job right overall,its a ""ok""place to work at."
good,"Working on the floor setting various planograms and stocking new merchandise. At times working on a team to set larger areas."

good,"I have four years experience in toy dept. retail, enjoyed working with public especially pleasing kids.    I got along well with co-workers, going beyond requirements. "
good,I have learned a lot about how to supervise people and to make sure everyone gets their breaks and lunches and I have also listening to customers and coworkers about the compliments or any complaints they may have. 
good,"Durante mi periodo en WM, aprendi varias cosas y pude adquirir poca experiencia, ya que me limitaban mucho porque era ""becaria"", poco a poco mis compañeras y superiores me fueron facilitando mas oportunidades de trabajo."
good,"Great for a semi permanent job, management was callus towards employees. "
good,"A typical day at work is usually a 8-9 hr shift. I work as a cashier and/or customer service depending on if they need an associate at the service desk or not. As a cashier I ring up customers with there purchases, load and/or reload prepaid debit cards, and assist customers with looking for things in the stpre. As a customer service associate I do returns/exchanges with items purchased at the store. send/recieve money through Money Gram International. They transactions can range from 20-3,000 dollars. I also help customers with paying bills which can vary from PSE&G to paying a Cellphone or water bill. What I learned from working at walmart are good customer service skills how to deal with different situations with different conflicts. "
good,"I loved my job at Walmart. I loved the people, too. My primary function was organization, of products on the floor, products in the back, employees, resources... And I learned organization may be my super-power. "
good,"I loved working here. All the bosses were amazing, and the people I worked with were like family."
good,"It was a decent job, beneficial yet kinda boring and strict when they didn't need to be"
good,"Out of the four full time ladies in the lab, I am the only one who does the stocking for our department, and for batteries. Time management is very important to succeed, as I am alone most of the time so I have to do what I can in the lab while I am alone, so that when coverage comes I can go and do my floor work. Marking off merchandise on a truck report to ensure we get what we are supposed to, going back to upc/invoicing if there is mistakes. Binning any overstock that I might have. I don't get paid anything extra for doing the stock work, which is what I hate the most. What I do enjoy, is the fact that I get to be the first one who sees the new cameras we get. Learning how to set modulars, having appropriate signage throughout the departments is crucial. Communication has really diminished between coworkers, and in the lab you need to communicate. So many customers come and go, some have special requests such as slide orders or negative orders and some are very picky with what they want. If it's due for a certain time, but what they want isn't written down well they of course get upset. There is also alot of maintenance that had to be learned. Changing all of the chemical in the main printer, and the film processor, changing paper magazines, running control strips, how to break into a film canister if needed, changing ribbon/paper on the kiosks. There is alot to this job, and I get paid the least out of all the girls and I don't feel that is fair to me, especially when I am the only one working stock for photolab and batteries. It's really hard to think of absolutely everything,"
good,">Very busy"
good,"A typical day as a Wal-Mart employee included fast paced work, long hours, a loud environment, and dealing with many customers.Through my work at Wal-Mart I have learned that it is best to be cheerful and polite to customers and how to adapt to a fast paced, constantly changing environment. The management team was rarely seen, leaving the employees to problem solve and work together. Co-workers at Wal-Mart were most often friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was learning to concentrate is such a loud environment. My favorite part of the job was meeting and helping the friendly customers."
good,Well i was a unloader so there was non stop moving. When i start working at Walmart every thing was fine work got done on time teammates worked together. But after the lead left from the back room everything went down hill. People weren't working together then the mangers also blamed us for issues in the store that did not involve us are even got us into trouble. We were over worked force to skip our breaks on some days. Then also when one person does something the other team may not of known of we all would get in trouble and coached. 
good,"I honestly did enjoy my position at Wal-Mart, but not for the location or the company. I found managers rarely did their jobs, and if they did it was not in a well-done manner. It makes it very difficult for other people to do their own jobs since most front end positions (Mine being cashier) We need overrides and other things done, but it was very difficult even when the store was quiet to get a Cash Manager over to our cash. So, If you'd like to work at Wal-Mart I suggest another location other than South Keys. Overall, I did enjoy it, just avoid this one if you can."
good,I learned more than i thought i would just being a sales associate. I went from being a sales associate to working in the pharmacy. It was a wonderful place to work. The best thing about being at walmart is the people you get to work with and getting to know the customers.
good,I felt management was always helpful when i needed it. The experience with the people daily was also very nice.
good,"Every night I needed to downstack all pallets and restock the shelf's, clean your department that you were working in that night, restock what ever items that could not be stocked and brought to the back room."
good,"Working for Walmart was definitely not what i would consider an amazing experience. Many employees, including myself, were paid minimum wages yet expected to perform the duty of management because of staffing problems. The management structure was weak at best and mostly nonexistent. "
good,I learned a lot working at Walmart. I learned more about the retail industry and how the inventory works. The management was great and they seemed to care about the customers and their satisfaction. 
good,"Wal-mart has decent benefits and could be an awesome place to work if management would stand by the principles Sam Walton put in place when he started the company, right now I am sure he is spinning in his grave.  "
good,"The job consists of breaking down the pallets of the day, rotating the stock before putting away, throwing out old and outdated stock, replenishing stock out on the floor, grading the stock on the floor for damaged and outdated, and help customers find product that they are looking for. "
good,"A typical day would include, counting inventory, price changes, merchandising, and customer assistance. I learned how to merchandise and teach and train new associates and department managers. I have a great relationship with my co-workers. We do whatever it takes to help each other out to get the job done correctly.The hardest part of the job would have to be trying to please each and every upset customer and the most enjoyable part would be seeing customers leave with a smile and having them return, becoming a regular. "
good,"I worked for Wal-Mart for 4 years beginning on night shift and slowly working my way up into my current position of wireless sales. The only reason I got the position I did was because I went to my store  manager in a last ditch effort to change to a day shift job before I had to quit due to me trying to continue my schooling.  "
good,The different departments are well managed and the company values diversity.
good,"while working at Walmart i had to deal with customers everyday, the most stressful part is when you have rude customers who will find anything to gripe about. "
good,wallmart can be a great company to work work or terible it varaes store to store
good,I found to work here was being a mindless drone and you would be treated with little to no respect.
good,"very routine, very good customer service skills, management was good , loved my coworkers, the pay wasn't very good, helping other people"
good,Walmart is a very fun place to work and it gave me the ability to work very independently.  It provided a very stress free environment.  It gave me face to face contact with my customers.  It was friendly employees and mangers.  Some of leadership was understanding and would work around any conflicts.
good,the work is terrible because the customers arent ideal. the advancement opportunities are constantly available but the compensation is terrible. the culture is diverse and there is plenty of jobs so you can move around if you get bored. 
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting lots of new people. It was a fast paced job that had strict deadlines to be met. The worst part of working there was the lack of benefits on compensation.
good,"The day's for me can be very busy or very quiet, I have learned a lot in this position and still learning with the help of other co-workers and management.  The hardest part of the job was trying to catch up from when we first opened but now that's been achieved and I like doing what I do and the days go very quickly."
good,"Stocking freight through the night in an area assigned by the manager. Stacking, and moving empty pallets to the back room. Helping other employees in their areas stock freight and taking items to clams. "
good,"You come in, you clean your area, make sure all is well. Sometimes asked to go to other departments and help. I learned alot, such as mixing paints and alot of hardware supply information. My co-workers were always great and we always helped each other out. My immediate supervisor was racist at times so it limited what I could do. There was no hard part to the job if you came in with the right attitude, it would get slow on the nightshift so trying to find something to do then would be tough. I only got promoted after a co-worker threw something intentionally at my face and I told management I'd quit unless something was done. The co-worker did not get fired or written up. "
good,"Checking the t-mat to find out what department I would be working in. Then I would go over to that department and make sure nothing is on the floor or just hanging on the racks. Next I would fold up all the merchandise that was on a table or a wall and make sure it is well organized and presentable. Finally I would put away all the returns, and while doing all of this I would assist customers and other associates with any problems or concerns they may have. Some times I would go to the front end to help cashier if the store was busy. I would also work in jewelry if they were short handed. I learned more patience and how to open up to people. when it come to managers I learned that a lot of times you cant take what they say to heart  and if you have a question about anything the best thing to do is go to them and ask for help or for more information on what they want you to do. Most of my co-workers became a friend and even though I don't work there any more we still stay in contact and I make sure a see them any time I'm in the store. the hardest thing about the job was the no communication. one manager will tell everyone to do something one way then another manager would say do it different and everyone would be confused and when you tried to explain it to them or tell the manager what the other manager told you they wasn't trying to hear it. the most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people making new friends. Helping people decide on things from what shirt they should get to if the pillows they are buying match the rest of the things.  "
good,"I had worked at Walmart for a while when I decided to go to school for business administration hoping to move up into management. I had been with the company for over 7 years before I finally moved up and after I finally did get promoted, I hated it; upper management is rude and disrespectful, expectations are impossible, and nothing is good enough in their eyes. My co-workers were wonderful....some of the management staff was okay however they were extremely superficial. They would treat a person one way when no one is around and then in front of other management, they are rude and disrespectful. The job itself was not hard nor did it take a lot of brain power to do the job. This is a really good go-between job for someone who is looking to better themselves but it's definitely not something I would consider making a career."
good,The company was an okay place to work but they dont pay that well and it is not where i would want to make a career
good,"A day at walmart standing for eight hours a day sometimes longer, assisting customers with their purchases. They are not understanding when it comes to family."
good,Management did not work well to resolve problems or listen to employees. Advancement is available for those who qualify. 
good,Walmart was not in my opinion a very good place to work. The management did not like to trust or communicate with the employees. They went thru a lot of employees while I worked there in 6 years. 
good,It was a decent place to work for. But the opportunity to advance is at a standstill because they do play favorites first.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with ""strangers"" I love meeting new people and you can learn a lot from someone even if its just a brief encounter. You never know what a simple smile may do in someone else's life."
good,"Ok place to work starting out in the work field."
good,worked 9 hours a day in garden department.   Benefits were not good. Management was okay. 
good,Pay is decent. Great benefits. No structure in management. Part time until promoted to full time
good,I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart for many years. The company changed after Mr. Sam died
good,Great place to work and network with customers because everyone shops at Walmart. Good way to get your name out by conversating with customers.  
good,"Typical day at work: I come in, head to the back for the meeting to know what Aisle I'm going to be assigned to. Then I head to the back to find a pallet jack and then I head to my aisle to down remove the grocery items from the pallet to the floor to stock. After I get done putting the grocery items on the shelves I either take my cardboard or plastic to the back to smash it or I take my overstock that would not go on the shelves back to the back. Then I come back out and pull the items on the shelves to the front for the customers to see and hopefully buy.  "
good,Busy work days. Over-management leads to mismanagement. Most co-workers will feel the same that the hardest part of the job is that the job(s) are ever-changing and the most enjoyable parts are getting paid and going home.  
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart for the holiday season, especially for in toys because children is what it is all about."
good,good company with okay pay .its a good first job when your just getting started. 
good,"At Taco Bell I learned everything I needed to know about being out in the work field. I learned everything from  customer service, to business, and management. I thought Taco Bell was one of the best fast food restaurants to work for.Management was alright. The chances for advancement was slim to none"
good,"my schedule varies week to week."
good,I would enjoy more pay. They want you to over work yourself. They want you to work in positions that you are not comfortable with and don't pay you for working. The hours are up and down hours.
good,"Lots of work, fast paced and requirements always changing. Nice woman but lots of family chaos. High-Stress job, had to learn how to not let her personal pain become my own. Learned a ton of medical terms and conditions."
good,"a typical day at work included counting the jewlery,cleaning show cases,greeting custmers,helping with product questions and completing closing procdures correctly.i leared to be a personable sales associate and i also leared about diffrent jewlery. my co-workers were friendly and productive.The hadest part of my job wa accuratly entering repairs in nd out of the pos aswell as keeping sales up.my favorite part of my jbs was to see a satisfied customer leave with eligant jewels."
good,"Was a interesting job but bit a typical  day of working was stocking my department, help customers with carry out as needed and the management was available when needed."
good,I come to work and run register and have fun with people. I'm there part time and sometimes it fun to work there.
good,Really it is only good if you need a flexible schedule or you don't have a lot of work experience/ as a filler job.
good,this job is very time consuming and will need to be able to work long hours and every day 
good,"I would ensure the quality of our customers to make sure they found all their items and if not i would take heed in finding away to make sure we would have it available at a future date.."
good,Not much different than any other part time job.  I am satisfied with th ecmpany and management.
good,Unload a truck to two trucks a night stocking floor trying to get merchandise out before the store opens up

good,Good Place To Work For Overall But They Make You Do Things That Are Not In Job Description ! Never Get Breaks Or Lunches On Time & Never Can Advance ! 
good,Stocked shelves and unloaded trucks.  employees were friendly. 
good,"La parte mas dificil del trabajo es que tiene horario de mall, por lo tanto practicamente no te queda vida familiar"
good,The company has a great work culture.  It would be enjoyable to work here for life if operations were in sync with Sam Walton's work culture.
good,"working at walmart gave me more confidence meeting new people every minute of the day, I learned to become more talkative and compassionate. "
good,"Stocking and zoning"
good,"Having worked at many locations, each experience has helped me learn and grow. I have held many positions within the company, and there are plenty of opportunities to go up in the company for those that wish to pursue that course of action. Management and co-workers will very greatly for each location. One store had a sense of family among co-workers and management, while another has a lot of the workers (including management) who treated their positions as just another job and the efficiency of the work produced effected that. "
good,This job is great for someone who is unemployed at the moment. They offer you alot of hours at first but then it seems to go away just as fast. Management is either your best friend or worst enemy.
good,This company has lost track of the original mission and vision put in place by Sam Walton
good,"No Hiper Bompreço foi onde trabalhei por um ano. Na maioria das vezes eu chegava no trabalho sem saber o que fazer, pois não tinham uma organização dos setores e tarefas. Então, eu passava muito tempo sem fazer nada até que chegasse alguém e resolvesse a minha situação e dos demais. Meus colegas de trabalho eram muito bons, responsavéis e inteligentes. Éramos uma equipe muita unida. Nossa Gerente não era muito de se comunicar conosco. Talvez, fosse muito ocupada para não prestar atenção no grau de satisfação dos funcionários. A parte mais dificil, era não poder falar no sentido de da sugestões ou pensar em crescer. Pois, em teoria existia muitas coisas para os funcionários. Mas na prática, sem comentários. "
good,A typical day would be  I punch in for work head up to the front to the cash register an being ringing out customers. Bagging the order while ringing the items up with speed and accuracy .Receiving the payment method and them their receipt and thanking them for shopping here and wish them a great day.
good,The Companies benefits and scheduling were very hectic and disorganized. 
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es bueno, los horarios son accesibles, pero si hay una mala administración en el manejo de mercancía, de personal, los jefes no se prestaban mucho al dialogo y el sueldo era bajo  "
good,As inventory control you use a handheld computer to count merchandise and locate misplaced merchandise in the backroom. Associates are friendly and management is very compromising. The toughest thing is you do a lot for minimum pay surprisingly their benefits are pretty good.
good,Daily work includes working with customers to resolve their computer needs. Periodically attending training courses to keep up to date with changing technologies. Management is supportive but could do better to thwart company politics in the promotions and hiring process. The hardest part of the job is making time to promote yourself through job shadows and networking. The most enjoyable part of the job is customer satisfaction.
good,"It is fun to assist the customers that come in, but the work ethic all depends on you and your co-workers."
good,"A typical day consisted of me going around my department helping customers, getting my returns, and overall facing my department.  I learned there to read the body language of customers, how to talk to them, when to talk to them, and how to understand them.  My management staff as lacking here and there, not just my department, had their quarks, but worked well together with each other.  My co-workers are awesome, talk about a family environment.  In the little time with Wal-Mart, I knew associates and kin to them.  Like Networking in the business world, except on a more personal scale.  That was easily the more enjoyable part of the job.  The hardest part of my job was being pulled from my department and going to another department.  I was trained in my department, so going to a new department (to cover a lunch, or break, or to cover until someone comes in) wasn't easy at first.  But helping customers in these new departments allowed me time to learn about the products in each department by reading labels and understanding the basic use of the products."
good,"Enjoyable part, co-workers and building rapport with customers."
good,If you want to be listened to you don't want to work here. You learn how not to treat people.
good,It was a good place to work for I loved workin with customers. the challenges where tuff. depending on my self to sovle the problem correctly.
good,"One thing I can say about working for walmart is that your job security was great. If you were full-time you were guaranteed 34 hour a week. For last ten years of work for walmar, I have learned to adapt to change."
good,"Enjoy my work  always on time,always.Must have perfection in my work. When I was a police officer I was outstanding officer in 1982. You dont get this for sitting in a coffee shop,"
good,"A typical work day starts around 7:15 AM and ends sometime after 5:30 PM.  Many days there isn't time for a lunch break so you eat on the run. "
good,A typical work day is checking out customers in automotive and writing up oil changes and tires tickets. Had great co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning about cars and tire sizes and etc.
good,"Come to work clock in and go do your job "
good,I worked at the jewelry counter and it was a fun job. I was also considered a cashier but at the jewelry counter.
good,very fast paced job. have to have your foot on the gas pedal every second of every day
good,This is a company where you want to beginning your first job.
good,It's ok if you need a job to take care of your family other than that don't work there.
good,Goood job and good pay
good,"Was once a great company to work for, but sadly they have strayed from the values the company was founded on."
good,During my stay here I loved working with my co-workers and seeing if I can answer my customers questions.
good,"Check customers to ensure large items were purchased, greet customers, weather proof the exit and entrances. aware customer of sales."
good,not a fun an good job...manager need to give respect.. love my coworking teamwork...they work u like machine an don't care about your health an well being..just being around my co working keep my day going they always showing them work.
good,"Good schedule, 3-4 day work week. You go as fast as you can in order to keep up with the demands in a very non-efficient managed environment. Everyone works hard because they are afraid of losing their jobs."
good,"A typical day at WalMart consisted of running the registers,zoning,and running code 6's. The management team were always willing to help when you needed them. My co-workers were like family,always lending help when needed.The hardest part of the job was dealing with unpleasant customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.The company itself doesn't look after their employees."
good,"Gone are the days of Sam Walton whose philosophy was ""Listen to your employees."" Walmart has long-gone corporate and is focused on the bottom line. Employees are hired part-time at minimum wage for a particular pay grade, and if you switch to a lower pay grade it's classified as a demotion. Forget benefits, unless you're one of the rare people to obtain full-time employment. Pay raises are given about $.15 at a time. The store I worked at was pretty good, and I enjoyed my job, but I felt no potential for advancement. And from what I saw about how they worked management like a dog, I had no desire to advance. The stores are LOUD and the noise gets to you after awhile. They will do anything they can to get out of paying workman's comp. Even if it's only a doctor's office visit. The moral is, don't slip and fall at work, ever. The hardest part of the job was listening to co-workers complain & gossip. I'd come in happy and leave disgusted. Also, it was extremely FRUSTRATING to go through all of the required computerized orientation material (and stay awake) only to have floor supervisors and managers completely contradict the training and chew you out for following it rather than the local store unwritten rules."
good,"i like meeting new people ,my mgmt didnt want to put it to where i wanted to be in the store at one point, i love being able to greet people with a friendly smile"
good,"Most of the management does not care about the employees home lives. The co-workers were wonderful people, though."
good,use to be a good place to work but new rules and ways of doing things has ruined the work experience and made walmart a less desirable place to shop
good,working at Walmart is good because you have the opportunity to move up from within and they work well with everyone with their schedules and people with other jobs. its a good second job.
good,Save money live better what more do u need good work place helping others
good,"A typical day of work for me was to clock in and report to the CSM's to be assigned a register, then to provide great customer service while finishing the customers final transaction. I learn the concerns and expectations of the average customer as well as how to treat them respectively. In my two years of employment with Walmart I was promoted twice and worked many areas of the store I learned very many skills and will always be thankful for what they taught me."
good,Walmart is a stable company to work for as they have always seemed to be a leader in retail. While all stores and management are different the management in this particular store needs a overhaul. There is a lot of favoritism and management is not willing to stand beside you. At Walmart you are just a worker and someone who can be replaced. They have seemed to lose all the values they were known for and its a shame.
good,"I like the fact that i'm non stop busy while at work, but not at all happy that Wal-Mart pays there employees so poorly."
good,"Most of my co-workers were very helpful and friendly, management was always willing to teach. I did not find much encouragement for advancement."
good,Got along great with co-workers.I learned alot about the product i was selling and had fun doing it.During the training the managers and supervisors were there to help during and after the training.Dont feel there was the most hardest part i9 enjoyed doing what i applied for.
good,"Customer Service, Assigned work duties for front line employees. I enjoyed the employees and customers the most."
good,"el apoyo de el gerente para que su personal se encuentre siempre bien capacitado y lograr que cresca en la empresa, ademas están al pendiente de todo el personal y en lo que les pueden ayudar para lograr un ambiente de trabajo cordial y ameno."
good,"Ive worked for Walmart for a little over a year now as a stocker on overnights. For the most part the job itself isnt too difficult, but it does wear you out fast. The pay isnt terrible on overnights but is just minimum wage for day shift. You also get a 10% discount on most things in the store. They dont hire a lot of people full time, most of the associates are part time. You dont make much money, unless youre in management which isnt easy to get into. Some of the managers are great, but most of them are rude and dont care much about their employees. They expect the good, hard working people to basically kill themselves every night to get done while others barely do the minimum. Not a bad job, definitely not a career choice."
good,"ring up customers, work with the public. I learned Customer service, cashier accounting, merchandise marketing. The work place was very impersonal so I didnt know many of the co-workers. The best part was the scheduled breaks."
good,"a typical ""night"" at walmart consisted of having all the crew members get together and choose the partof the job you were each to do.Each""job"" had a set routine to follow. regardless of this everyone dust mopped first so the sales floor was clear of debris so not to complicate running of floor scrubing machine after you swept your area you proceeded to satisfy your nightly duties based on the part of the store you designated for yourself. always customer service and make sure your tasks were completed in a timely manner."
good,"started at 6 AM until 3 Pm- stocked merchandise, co-workers were friendly, hardest part of the job was not being able to finish before management would have you doing other jobs."
good,"Es una empresa buena, solo con detalles que podrían mejorar entre ellos el respeto por el individuo,salarios,horarios, pero tiene la ventaja de que puedes aprender todo lo que tu quieras, sin prohibiciones y eso te amplia horizontes."
good,Working in Walmart is always interesting. You are in the position to meet new people daily. The company looks for innovative ideas to keep the employee motivated. The hardest part of the job is standing constantly
good,"In nearly 10 years for Wal-Mart, I've never had better co-workers. We made a great team. However, after our original store manager left to oversee another store about 3 years ago, things started going downhill as far as management was concerned. As people, they were great! As management, not so much. They would make sweeping changes that we all protested. Questioned how we'd been running things in departments successfully for years. To add insult to injury, they would expect out of one associate, the work of at least 3 people. We were short staffed, and morale tanked. They refused to hire anyone. We all knew that if they increased labor costs that management wouldn't get the bonuses they desired. Our profit share bonuses however, were far less than with the original management team. The hardest part of this job was watching people with whom you were trained, get fired or choose to retire because management decided they were no longer capable of doing their job. Some of those people had been there when the original store at 1600 Bechtle was built. The most enjoyable part of my job was the regular customers that came in when you were working. Many of them became more than just customers."
good,"As soon as I'd get to work at least 2-3 people would leave on they're lunch/break or go home. Before I'd even washed my hands or read my duties for the day somebody was asking me to come help them or timers were going off. I'd get the food out first and immediately help the next customer in line. As soon as we could get the lines down and things calmed down managers would come around and give us more tasks and I haven't even got the second to even read what i was suppose to do. We were always short handed and constantly getting complaint from customers. There were a lot of times when it was only one person and a lot of times when it was only that person closing at night. I was constantly coming in early and staying late. It got to the point where other associates would call in before they're shifts and ask how the day is going and who had called in or hasn't showed up, and then later to find out that person has called in. There was even at time when other associates would come in intoxicated and swear and be extremely rude to the customers and management did nothing. I asked lots of times to be switched departments for about 5 months. I wanted to go back to the deli once they figured things out. But things just got to hectic there, I needed out."
good,"I work at a very fast pace, Its a very busy place with alot to learn and management it terrible, the hardest part about the job is the price comparison. I enjoy working with the customers and co-workers."
good,aprendi a tratar mas a las personas y algo dificil era calificar a los compañeros de trabajo
good,"I enjoyed stocking overnight at Wal-Mart, if your a hard worker and you stick to your job its easy and the shift goes quick. I learned how to be a leader, despite being just an associate i was usually put in charge of several co-workers at a time because i knew the work so well and always stayed organized."
good,"Typical day at work; very busy, start out by finding out what dept I will be working in then log into computer and find out how many hours of work is scheduled for me in 8 hrs. Sometimes they can task out 24 hrs of work and expect me to get it done in 8. Then get pallet jack and start hauling product to floor to stock. I have learned so much, hard to say. I find it that if I don't learn one new thing a day my day wasn't worth it. Management, most are nice and easy to work with, others not so. Love my co-workers! Hardest part of job, is finding enough time to finish all that is expected. Most enjoyable part of job is knowing I can help others and to do the best job I can and do."
good,I seeked employment to Wal-Mart as I was enrolled in Heald College. I'm currently interested in being employed to a profession under my fields of study.
good,"I am a part-time cashier and I get along with everyone, including management. I try to be helpful to all staff and customers and have received many compliments from them. I have met many women there who I call my friend."
good,Worked there for 7 years. Started as a cashier and worked my way up to Department Manager enjoyed my time at Walmart.
good,Working there you never have any time for yourself. You are always at work. They work you too hard and pay too little
good,good place to work where you get to help cutomers and see all of the new merchandise.
good,"A typical day of unloading trucks is decent hard work, and the compensation for this position is grossly under paid."
good,"stocking shelves, cleaning the store"
good,"Ter um bom relacionamento com os clientes e com os funcionários é o mais importante em uma empresa e isso lá não era nenhum sacrificio ,a parte mais dificil do serviço era o horário pois eu não tinha muito tempo para aminha família mas estar com os meus colegas de trabalho amenizava um pouco pois eramos quase uma família tinhamos um ótimo trabalho em equipe."
good,The hardest parts of this job consisted of conficting requests by three levels of upper management and the possibility of hours cuts in order for the store to rech the goals set by corporate.
good,"On a typical day and every day, customers and/or patients are our number one priority. I assist patient/customers with inquires they might have in terms of medication. Throughout my day, I constantly educate my customers of the indications, side effects, and when to call the doctor when they experience adverse reactions to their medications. I also ensure that my customers leave the Wal-Mart pharmacy in high spirits. Although I am usually busy managing the pharmacy employees as well as the medications, I often find time to assist customers/patients at the main customer care counter. Being the lead pharmacy technicians comes is a challenge yet, rewarding each day. My responsibilities as a lead pharmacy technician are to make sure all the new technicians are properly trained by rotating from in-putting prescriptions in the data base, solving troubleshoot prescriptions, filling prescription accurately, and assisting patients at the pick-up station. I have learned and gained the benefits of working as a team on a team basis. The hardest part of my job is playing the middle role of patients and providers. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to communicate with patients and making sure their needs are exceeded beyond what they initially came in for."
good,It's was just ok maximum work for minimum pay. Management didn't want to approve my school schedule so I was force to resign.
good,"I love the other associates I work with. Management is a different story. I won't get into detail, but some of the rules they make are not followed by everyone. They have their favorites and the values of Sam Walton are not followed as they should be."
good,I would pull out pallets off of the delivery truck from the back to the floor where we would distribute the freight to each department. Each department had a stocker or two to unload new freight and replenish any existing items that were empty or running out of. I was in charge of the hardware department and managed the paint station if anyone need me to mix a color for them. I stocked shelves and created endcaps of any new items that were to be displayed as a sale item or new item that customers might be interested in buying.
good,"Nice work days and very productive days. I learned alot about vehicles I had never worked on and easier ways to get around each car. Management was not that great, lots of managers wanted to run automotive department when they had no idea whatsoever what was going on in the shop or with cars for that matter. My co-workers where very helpful and knowledgeable. Hardest part of the job was when we where short staffed. Most enjoyable part of job, was working on all kinds of vehicles."
good,Boa pra quem começa seu 1º emprego é como se fosse um estagio.
good,"On most days i would go in and either be in shoes or jewelry for the last 5 or 6 months running the register at jewelry,showing jewelry and sales stoking shelves or jewelry displays,customer service,binning overstock,putting up strays,filling in for different departments I learnt many diff departments and to be ready to work many different areas in the store with just a minutes notice.Management at walmart was difficult not in the beginning i had a soft lines boss who had been there 22 years then she got fired and had 3 different soft line bosses within my last 6 months and then there was a floor mgr and a jewelry mgr so things got twisted a lot but i really loved it over all working in the public i really enjoy"
good,Great company with consistent work. Lots of potential to grow and development growth.
good,dia de trabalho muito corrido e muito prazeroso. onde se tornava a parte mais agradável do dia. a parte mais difícil era o salário que não era compatível com os esforço diários.
good,"It was a good and (mostly) steady job. I was trained properly and always felt comfortable doing my assigned duties. My biggest complaint was the company's unwillingness to work with schedules/my personal life. I got sick a lot while working for Wal-Mart, and as such I came into work ill. They would often send me home and have that absence count against me. They would tell me to schedule doctor's appointments 'on my own time', but my schedule as such was for me to work during doctor's office hours. I missed a lot of work in 2009 and 2010 due to my mother having seventeen strokes and heart surgery and nearly dying, and I was ultimately let go because of these absences, despite having a medical leave of absence form."
good,"O dia de trabalho é normal, muitas tarefas e pressão, aprendo cada dia a saber lidar com situações que surgem do nada, e resolvemos o quanto mais cedo possível. As vezes com o apoio da gerência, e em outros momentos com nossa iniciativa. Mas com as idéias de todos os colegas, e cooperação, tem-se a melhor solução, a qual é aplicada para determinada oportunidade. A parte mais difícil do trabalho é quando sobre-carrega muitas tarefas a uma pessoa, e a parte mais agradável do trabalho é saber que somos importante para aquela empresa."
good,"The day starts by clocking in on the time clock, scanning my badge to find out which register I am going to, for when I clock in or get back from breaks it is a must do. Then, running a register or self check out and helping people having a fast and speedy check out. I have learn't how to rerun a register and how to speak up because of having a low voice tone. I have learn't different ways of people paying and how to get it threw the computer system. Mangement is great, but ask to much of one person like running five departments at once and helping customers. The hardest part of my job is dealing with supervisors who dont want to work. The best part of my job is meeting new people from every walk of life."
good,"very high demanding job, something different everyday, always got repermanded for doing my job!!!!"
good,The training material is abundant but the management does not follow S.O.P. most of the time. The Benifits are comparable. and the pay is also comparable.
good,The store is disorganized and the managers do not communicate properly with one another.
good,"its a good place to work, but management is lazy an yell at people that work an r friends with the ones that dont. i love walmart but i dont like what it be came i miss sam walton."
good,"Walmart where to begin, they treat their employees with respect, and they treat their customers with respect."
good,I enjoy being in management and the freedom my position gives me but I am looking to work a little closer to home.
good,The co-workers I love to work with. I work overnight so it is tougher to be able to advance in the company.
good,As a checkout operator I serve customers either at the checkout or assist them at the self checkouts. I have learnt how to deal with different types of customers. The management is very good. All my co-workers are wonderful colleagues.The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the lovely new customers and serving the regulars.
good,"On a typical day at work, I reviewed my area for safety and provided information to both entering and exiting customers."
good,Ok work place. Management was very nice to work with hardest part of job was staying awake it was overnight.
good,"Primeira coisa era ser bem concentrado no trabalho, sem sequer alguns erros porque qualquer erro causa desconforto aos demais."
good,I like the job itself but the managment sweep any problems that you have under the rug and don't deal with them.Your schedule is always messed up and then they get mad at you for not wanting to work longer than your schedule tells you to work.
good,"I was responsible for sales of merchandise and specialty items such as paint, live fish, ammunition, etc."
good,i gained alot of experience and knowledge working here
good,I worked various positions in the company. You have to enjoy people to work in this field as its a high volume store.
good,This company has changed over the 13 years I have been there. while there are still many positive aspects of my job I am not in a position that I am able secure advancement or have the work/life balance that I desire. The security of this job is day to day in the current structure that is set up which does not provide for the goals I aspire to.
good,What I learned was how to be humble and satisfy my customer more
good,tear down shelves rebuilt shelves helping the other workers what ever needed done
good,"re-stock the worms, get my keys, stock shelves till someone needs help or if they need help on the truck or tire lube and express i go help them."
good,"My work day consisted of the same things everyday. I would run the cash register and help customers with any problems they had. I learned how to use a cash register, but more importantly, I learned I am good at working with people. I didn't associate with the managers very often. My co-workers were all very different types of people. I got along with all of them and never had any arguments or disputes. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers, but that didn't happen very often. The best part of my job was getting to talk to the customers who weren't angry."
good,"While WalMart has 3 core ideals that every associate should follow it is up to the individual to carry those out. My experience was unfortunate for I found myself with members of management who lacked respect for their employees. Overall I'd say WalMart is still a great place to work. The 3 Beliefs are excellent guides for a happy workplace, but it's up to the individual to follow those guides."
good,"Review day in sales with evening meeting, recieve task, Always nice co-workers& management, but expectations of time for tasks...always wrong I think.Hardest part of job is making those times. Most enjoyable is time spent with other co-workers"
good,"Typical day at work. Serving customers. Learning experience everyday. The management is consistent. My co-workers are the best. The hardest part of the job, is that you can't please everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job is break time."
good,"I love it here, i'm just not making enough, I get paid 7.65 an hour and I have 2 kids I cant afford that."
good,"Walmart is a great job. Its hands on also but you work in different areas just helping, if needed."
good,Okay hours and people to work with
good,1) Pressão para entrega de atividades;
good,nice job.. good pay . overtime. breaks allowed. they run a tight business. friendly workers.
good,"-contagem de dinheiro e conferencia, envio de malotes, apoio na frente caixa;"
good,"opening cash, putting bags out for every cash register, telling customer about our wal-mart credit card, putting stock out for front-end,"
good,"shipping and recieving boxes and different kinds of freight. Ive learned more abouy stocking and distribution centers. The management is rarely seen because of the fast pace its more shift leads and supervisors. My coworkers work just as hard as I do, we are a good team. The hardest part is that some days that you are scheduled you might be sent home early because of a slow day or just not many people are needed. the most enjoyable would be the laidbackness of the job."
good,"it has mediocre job openings for those with little to no work experience, but is highly prejudiced against single, young adults, giving older people better advancement options even though the younger one might be a better worker than the older one. management is terrible with a select few actually treating the work environment like work instead of a social scene. rumors get spread and reputations are thrashed behind ones back and control what options you are given in the working environment. overall, i would not recommend working for this company for anything other than temporary. not a difficult job, anyone can do it."
good,"it wasnt a bad place to work, but the latest management team was taken from a smaller wal mart, wasnt used to the larger wal mart."
good,"Typical day of work will be binning consumable goods, making sure that pallets on high steel conforms with the safety standards. Fast-paced environment."
good,Co-workers are very good to work with and I enjoy the customer contact
good,"Pela manhã coferia as mercadoria dos setores para ver se estavm em data de validade para podem ser retiradas do salão de vendas),depois dava entrada e saida nos veiculos da casa e comferia as mercadorias qui esvaqm saindo ou entrando com os carros para ver se tinham algum defeitos. A tarde eu ficava observando os setores da loja para ver se tinha alguns fucionarios inrregular com os equipamentos de E.P.I e tambem olhava as mercadorias que estavam sendo embaladas ou ultizidadas para quaisquer ultilidades com os colegas,depois ficava no cftv para ficar dando apoio aos colegas que estavam no salão de loja."
good,"I like to be productive, and proactive. In this way, i make my customers enjoy a shoppping experience.Good customer service is my strength.I do care for the growth of a company."
good,"I learned how to operate a cash register, and I dealt with customers on a daily basis."
good,"A day at work at Wal-Mart would be described as unpredictable. U would never know what area you were going to be assigned, but I was always ready to take on the task I was given. Being assigned to different areas gave me the advantage to learn and advance in different skills which was always a plus. The management team was amazing and efficient to the employees. There was never a dull day working with my co workers, they made the time fly by so fast. The hardest part of the job was working the service desk because of the customer returns. Sometimes it's hard depending on the return policy especially if we can't take something back. I never wan an unsatisfied customer. The best part of the job is seeing satisfied customers."
good,Night shift. Skids are prepared in the aisles and stocks in the skids must be displayed and zoned before 7am.
good,A typical day at work was centered on customer service and profitability. I learned scheduling and how budget and forecast profit based on sells. I learned how to think outside the box and understand that people were the greatest commodity a company truly has. The hardest part of the job was the hours worked. The most enjoyable thing was the people.
good,"Aprendi los procesos de distribuciòn, gerencia demandante, falta de oportunidades, conocer gente y encontrar formas para motivarla, no contar con fundamentos por parte de la gerencia para tramitar mi baja de la empresa."
good,I work overnights from 10pm til 7am stocking freight throughout the store. I learn how to use people skills and use good customer service. The management is strict but they want things to be done right just like any other. Co-workers are pretty cool because it is a diverse environment. The hardest part of the job is getting the store stocked and zone before you depart. The most enjoyable part of the job is associating with your co-workers and enjoying being at the job.
good,Walmart is a great place to work they just need to give more hours.
good,Como toda area de atendimento ao cliente haviam dias estressantes e dias mais tranquilos. Mas com o passar do tempo se aprende como lidar com o publico em geral.
good,"a parte mais agradável era estar com contato com os clientes, enquanto a gerencia e a liderança, precisa melhorar e muito."
good,I start my day shopping the features to fill the counters with the merchandise. Scan outs and fix inventory problems. Stock as needed to maintain inventory on the shelves. Build features when needed. Do price changes and notes from managers. Assisting and greeting customers through out the day. I have learned to be very flexible and prioritize tasks. Walmart is a very fast paced environment. The hardest part of my job is not having enough time or help to get everything done. The most enjoyable is being able to interact with the customers.
good,"Handling heavy amounts of cash transactions, checks, debit and credit cards, answer customers questions, and provide information on procedures or policies provide the best customer service."
good,"The Asset Protection position was something that I was very interested in, but due to multiple corporate policies that exist within the company, it because more stressful than it needed to be. The majority of my daily tasks were imbued with the idea that if you do any single aspect of a task wrong you could end up in court or terminated. There was a deadline set for individual employees that would lead to termination if you did not meet those goals. While that system in itself would be functional, it doesn't serve any purpose in a field where the amount of work you have fluctuates very rapidly depending on the amount of crime present in the facility."
good,"It doesnt matter how hard you work or how good you do your job 75% of the time. What does matter is how well you say you do it and how good you look at doing it. I work with many people in the same position.. We all agreed i was, one of the best if not the best, But i never was considered for a promotion.. But are co-work who would take 15 minute breaks ever hour or would clock in from lunch half an hour early but still take the rest of the hour to sit in his car and be on lunch. Was promoted. With a dollar raise, and 40 hour weeks secured.. Just because he was pretty good friends with a Assistant Manager. And still to this day. The manager call one of the worst in my ex-coworkers opinions, The best one off all of them.. When obviously they dont see everyone else working they're butt off to make up for his laziness."
good,working on floor meaning the main part of the store is really but working in the backroom is not so nice managers arent always on the same page
good,"Its a great starting job, but when you are trying to take care of your family on a limited income it makes it very hard."
good,"Monotonous but decent work, learned to do the best I can at work starting the first day"
good,I stayed busy at work. I learned how to use a 960 and scan items for storage and pick items. My managers were friendly and easy going. My co-workers were friendly and got along with. There was no hard part for this job. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and staying busy.
good,"Me gusta mi trabajo,, me esfuerzo pero el ambiente de trabajo malo, subgerentes pesimos, por esto la mayoria de mis compañeros renuncian. El jefe de mi area no da soluciones al contrario da problemas y mis compañeros y yo siempre pagamos sus platos rotos."
good,love walmart.. its a great place to meet nice people even customers
good,Motivação aos funcionarios com um objetivo e organização para poder atender da melhor forma os clientes.
good,late shift hard work low pay high demand to perform in short amount of time
good,"Working for walmart has its ups and downs. Mostly down. You have your regulars that you grow to have pleasant relationships with, but then you have everyone else. Managers are far from helpful and often hinder the upholding of rules and regulations."
good,"These jobs taut me a lot about responsible, and learning to work hard and with others. Management and co-workers were always great to work with."
good,"My manager was unreasonable, and there was a lot of unnecessary drama always going on day to day."
good,Worked in Cosmetics as a Sales Associate. Enjoyed sets Modular Displays tedious but busy work it was like putting a puzzle together sometimes. Getting all of the days freight out on to the shelves for the consumers to purchase. Maintaining the department for cleanliness. Assisting the customers with locating the merchandise they were looking for.
good,Walmart stores definitely have a reputation that is often exaggerated. An hourly supervisor position has many responsibilities to training and motivate staff. however. that are difficult to achieve without the authority to directly discipline.
good,I go into work and make sure that all of the files and insurance information that is need for that days patients are ready before the patients come in for their appointments. Maintain and protect patients PHI and mainain proper HIPPA regulations. The most enjoyable part of my working day is see the patients when they come in to pick up their glasses and they put them on and they are so happy aout the fact that they can see!
good,I work in the Cash Office and do balances and deposits.
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers and some of the customers can be pleasant to assist. The hardest thing about the job is when I have to do the inventory by myself on the weekends because I have do inventory counts on the salefloor and backroom and do all my picks by 4:00 at Walmart.
good,They always gossip and they dont know how to treat employees with respect!
good,"Walmart is a very good job to have, but not for a career. Its good as a second job. Its always busy, so that makes it fun and the time moves by quickly. I love all of my co-workers. We're like a big family. The management at Walmart is not so great. They have a tendency not to care about their associates. The hardest thing to do is to keep up with everything. Everything is in a fast pace. You can fall behind if you do not keep up. Also, holidays, for us, is very hard to go through. But its manageable."
good,Too much politics in the workplace that don't belong there. They commonly ask you to finish things that weren't achievable in your shift time. While the pay is good for retail all the downsides make it an unenjoyable workplace.
good,Its sometimes fun but its work so I understand that. Working here has taught me a lot of lessons but everything is a learning experience. I dont complain because fortunately I do have a job unlike a lot of people wjo are stressing looking for a job and on unemployment. Working here I have seen a lot of hard workers get taken advantage of and not recognized just because the bosses show favoritism to friends and family. Me as an employee myself have called to our corprate and made complaints against the company.
good,"In a typical day, you can expect to feel like you've accomplished nothing, or possibly that you are moving backwards. You will be pushed to and, in some cases, past your breaking point, but it is for not only the good of the store but it builds your character as well. It's a great first job, you will learn the ins and outs of retail, which is a very handy skill to have. The management is great. Most of them worked their way up in the company, making them familiar with the plights of working there. Some times they push beyond their bounds, but most of the time they are down to earth. You can easily develop a relationship with your co-workers which makes the time there pass much faster than if you didn't have that opportunity. While the work may not be the most pleasurable it is a challenge, the most difficult part of my job was that I had to piece together the freight in a way that minimized space taken up, and was still stable to stand on its own, while still accounting for it. However, this was not a terrible task, as my managers would allow us to listen to our music on a stereo that they had purchased for us."
good,"A typical day was unloading 1-2 trucks full of general merchandise and separating them onto palates according to department, pulling the product onto the floor and then stocking the merchandise in its proper place."
good,trababajo normal aprendi el funcionamientos de algunas maquinas los gerentes y encargados de mi sector eran muy atentos al igual que mis colegas
good,On a typical day you go in and do what you are assigned to do. Your job title does not limit you to just that job. If there is help needed in any department around the store and you are done with your job you will go help where needed. The customers are lively and keep you on your toes. Co workers are friendly and work together to make sure evry job is done in a proper and timely manner. Management is not that great. The managers change quite frequently and it just seems as though there is no communication between them. The hardest part of the job is not being reckognized for you accomplishments. The most ejoyable part of the job is the friends you make in your co workers.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart I go in and I stock and cull the produce. The hardest part of the job is taking out the organics(the bad produce). My co-workers are well balanced people and are, for the most part, enjoyable people to work with. Management is not what i would like it to be and could be better."
good,"Well a typical day at work for me is when i first clock in i start on the backroom process, picks, audits, counts etc. I basically do that the remainder of the day. The management there arent the best but they are ok. Its just they arent all on the same page their..the hadest part of my job is trying to get it done by a certain period of time. Other then that its a good job but little pay."
good,I was more comfortable at the Photo Center than being a cashier. Long hours on my feet. Management was not great or respectful and they were very unorganized. Coworkers were great.
good,meeting in the morning and getting started.
good,"With this job I have learnt to vary myself in various departments. Working with the public can be challenging, yet rewarding. I have an excellent group of coworkers."
good,"I only worked for a short amount of time, but I had a good department manager and work team. The area of the store I worked was never boring or slow. We always kept busy, and I enjoyed working with the general publice."
good,"Worked with some great people, I've built many good relationships there. Enjoyed learning new things that I will be able to take with me to future employment. Strengthened my customer service skills."
good,"Typical day starts with a meeting, then straight to your assignment. I learned how to use a Telxon to navigate items in the store, and to keep track of inventory. Also how to use forklift and scissor lift."
good,day start out fast pace.has a slow time. learned to keep to self.some management alright being nice to abusive cust. talking to people and my coworkers.
good,"The company is a decent employer. They require breaks and lunches, so there is no forcing you to skip breaks. Overall there is no major problems to working here. You tend to just be a number here though, personal relationships are difficult to build. Working your way up the ladder revolves around computers (to get into management you must pass a test and then wait 2 years to re-take the test), instead of looking at which workers actually hold the potential to actually do the job well. I have never had a problem with management, I am actually pretty well liked, but I have had issues getting to where I would like to be because of the computer system having an error. Management seems to not know what they are doing/talking about unless they are one of the ones that have worked their way up."
good,"Left because I needed better hours. Not a fun place to work,. co-workers were not friendly .Did not learn a lot. Hardest part of job was trying to work there with very little or no training and no one willing ot help. Left for better hours , more money and a lot friendlier atmosphere."
good,"Very Repetitive work environment. Advancement isn't impossible but not worth it unless you go to assistant manager and above. Co workers are very diverse, some are very nice and others only gossip. The hardest part about the job is knowing you get payed basically nothing and do the most work in the company while the high paying people get payed a lot more and do hardly anything."
good,Overall not an incredibly bad place to work depending on the store you're employed at. Management does however quite often ask overwhelming tasks of their associates.
good,good place to work
good,there was never a dull moment always a good time with coworkers and management we knew what had to be done managment told us at being of shift and we came through everytime
good,I enjoyed my job. putting a smile on a consumers face is a good feeling.
good,"A typical day at work is either I have a day where I have to hustle to get things done and make sure that at least everything important thats a need to be done, is done way before its close to closing time because it is so busy, or it is the opposite. I've learned alot from retail pharmacy but unfortunately walmart does not do compounds so I dont have any experience there but keeping the customer satisfied, and how to be a team player and get things done. I love all my co-workers because we worked well together everyone compliments each other when it comes to the job. The only hard part of the job is when you are dealing with rude customers and the most enjoyable part of the job is when you meet your customers expectations."
good,"First full time job out side of high school. I was made a manager in under a year, and it taught me so much."
good,I have learn to do site to store as well doing money gram for customers take customer returns an exchanges an work the registers working with good co worker as was some good management the hardest part is work on an short notice with other co worker calling off an making the work hard an very busy but I made everything work as the very best I know how to an the best is when we got the bonus off our sales as an reward an I enjoy taking care of customers to be happy an enjoyable
good,"Working at Walmart was a learning experience. I gained confidence with customers and co-workers. I talked alot with customers, got comfortable with being more outgoing and talking with people. A typical day at work was always dealing with customers and their concerns. At first I was just a cashier then I went up to working as a Customer Service Representative. I would return any items for customer satisfaction and I would answer any questions they would have and organize stock, which would be returns. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people everyday and always be busy. The hardest part of my job was being the only person on till returning items, and it was hard coping with how they organized staff."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart has been an eye opener for me. It's my first official job I have actually had. Working at that place made me realize that I don't want to end up working there for all my life. Though working there has help develop better social skills with other people, since I am a cashier after all. The hardest part about this job is the customers and keeping them satisfied. I have met some pretty amazing people at Wal-Mart, and I appreciate them for helping and training me. Overall, it's not a bad job, but it's just not for me. This job just doesn't suit me."
good,"Wal Mart is basically a good place to work, they have a professional work environment from my esperience. It can be fun and exciting at times. It does carry a certain level of stress when your duties require you to be responsible for high dollar merchandise. I enjoyed working at Wal Mart for the time that I was there and if it would be feesible to return to Wal Mart at this time I would certainly entertain that as a possibility."
good,"Just management was not well coordinated, and unprepared."
good,"A typical day working at Wal-Mart included customer service related to all products in the Electronics Department and other departments if needed. Stocking freight and binning all overstock. Setting up displays for new merchandise and keeping displays clean and stocked. Working at Wal-Mart allowed me to develop great customer service skills, interpersonal skills and the skills to work efficiently with a team. My immediate managers were fun to work with and were very knowledgeable about what needed to be done that day and all tasks at hand. Most of my co-workers were very friendly and hard working although some did have problems with showing up and didn't last long. My job itself wasn't hard but there were times that management disagreed on things and I as an associate was caught in the middle. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely helping the customers to understand our products and helping them decide what would be best for their needs and preferences."
good,A typical Day is Stocking and binning merchadise in the backroom bins.
good,"I learned to be better organised and to work well with people from different backgrounds and natioanalities, that for me was the most enjoable part of the job. The hardest part was having to stand for long hours. The general work ethics was great. Overall it was a nice experience."
good,"great customer service experience, however no room for growth within the company"
good,Being productive & staying safe was th best part of my job its was a good job that makes good money
good,probably about 50 customers during my shifts of 6 hours. i learned how to pull stock out of the back room and scan it out on the floor. managment was pretty good they had the open door policy.Great coworkers some wanted to talk more than work but still great attitudes to the customers. Hardest part of the job was unloading the shipment trucks when they stuck me back there. The coworkers were probably the best part of the job they all had great attitudes.
good,"Answering multi line phone, stocking, merchandising, ordering, cash register, supervising associates, price changes, meetings."
good,very fast paced
good,"Besides the crazy hours, I loved the people I worked with. It was almost always busy. When we had down time it was always fun teaching the cashier new things and training them to better themselves."
good,Worked too hard for the benefits and pay received. Long schedules
good,"At Wal-Mart I was a Stocker and a Cashier. However, I also did some managerial work. The management team was very umnappreciative. Whenever we had store visits from people of an upper position, the associates were in charge of making sure the store was in order. Wal-Mart never really allowed for one to move uo no matter how much of an asset they really were to the company."
good,"The co-workers for the most part are great people. Management favors people who don't work consistently and if you do work then more and more is expected of you. Benefits are not great and if you are part time, which is all they generally hire now, then benefits are meager. They took away almost every holiday to be home with family. I am in customer service and usually by myself, which makes no sense in the holiday season. There is no consistency within management, one person says one thing and the next changes it. I learned that if you kiss up to management you can get whatever you want and if you work then expect to do it continually by yourself whether or not you need help. The hardest part is the hours. There is flexibility for some associates but not all. I enjoy my repeat customers and most of my co-workers."
good,"Trabalhei durante 12 anos na empresa,tem como ramo varejo supermercados uma área de exige pessoas dinâmicas,por haver grande concorrência entre as empresas da mesma área."
good,"I learned how to handle customers, and how to use a cashier. My co-workers were very friendly and easy to get along with. Management was decent, but some of them would rush us through if we had a concern and needed to talk to them. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was when I had a line of customers, it would keep me busy and time would fly by. The hardest part was when I would have no customers and it was slow."
good,"very rude management, lousy salary. not a fun place to work at. management not easy to get along with"
good,"Aprendir bastante a lidar com o público , trabalho em equipe , a liderança ,com a cultura da empresa."
good,"A typical day at work usually involves working in multiple departments in a very fast paced environment. I work as a cashier, as a CSM, and at the service desk. As a cashier you help the customer throughout the checkout process via answering questions, processing money transactions, and using good customer service. As a CSM you support all the front end employees by helping deal with unhappy customers, answering employee questions about proper procedures on how to do things, managing breaks and lunches so they are not late, and bringing cash to registers when prompted. As a service desk employee you handle a wide range of customer transactions ranging from returns with or without a receipt, processing money orders, processing money transfers, processing bill payments, cashing checks, and sorting any returns into the proper bins. I have learned a wide range of skills that I can use in future jobs or in a higher level at my current store. My co-workers are all very nice and fun to work with. Management doesn't seem to be around all the time when you need them and tend to take quite awhile to get up to deal with unruly customers. The hardest part of the job is remembering all the policies and rules that have to be followed for every transaction."
good,"A typical work day consitsedof handling money, checks and credit and bagging groceries. I learned to be happ and smile no matter waht usually makes that persons day alot better...handle money and do the job of a cashier. Co-Workers were awesome...Mangement not so great..Believe that treated the cashiers not nicely and often forgot about breaks and lunches. Hardest part of the job standing for such long periods of time, Most enjoyable part of the day was talking and interacting with so many different types of ppl."
good,"My day at Walmart was to wait on customers, zone the area, freight, and to put away returns. I learned customers are an important part of the job."
good,I left this job because I physically cannot stand for hours on end. I enjoyed the training program and the other employees I met. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting the customers.
good,"Un dia tipico de trabajo era,primero realizar la apertura de la tienda con devoluciones, orden de gondola y luego de la apertura la reposicion principalmente de los huecos en gondola y llenado de pasillos,aprendi muchas cosas a taves de varios cursos obligatorios y opcionales que realizamos, mis compañeros de trabajo desempeñaban sus tareas en el sector que le correspondia y de esa forma con cada persona en su sector no habia problemas,lo mas dificil fue el cambio de horarios cuando habia que trabajar durante un periodo prolongado en la noche y lo que mas me gusto que dentro del roce,problemas personales y demas se vivia un buen ambiente de trabajo y compañerismo."
good,"Muitos dos valores e princípios da empresa não são levados em consideração. Acredito que isso tem que partir das lideranças, mas não vejo acontecer."
good,"boa de trabalhar,oportunidade de promocao e gerentes reconhece trabalhos dos funcionarios"
good,Es una empresa de talla internacional mejor pagada de los centros comerciales de mexico; se tiene poco apoyo por prte de los gerentes; por eso tiene muy frecuente rotacion de personal
good,"Customer service and respect varied among each individual. Most managers were rude.I increased my customer service, bagging skills, and cash register experience."
good,"Management lacks communications sometimes and contradict each other. For the pay management puts alot of work and stress on employees. I did learn alot working there, how to operate forklifts, power jacks, handheld scanners and inventory sysytems."
good,You can come in with a plan but once you clock in your entire plan has to change because something has gone wrong or a member of management doesn't like your plan for your department.
good,I worked overnight and I had a good team of other employees that were great at what they did. Good benefits. Overtime if your willing to work it.
good,"A company this huge should pay it's workers a better wage, and provide full time work."
good,"As a fitting room associate, it is very hard to complete my job when the managers don't take the time to answer a phone call from another associate or an upset customer. I resigned because I asked for four hours less than what they continuously scheduled me for part time. I needed less hours for my daughter, as I am currently the only parent she has at home. Her father is deployed. A typical day at work consisted of answering the phones, cleaning the fitting rooms, zoning the intimates, and helping customers. My co-workers were amazing and very helpful. Management, as I stated above, made it hard for me to succesfully complete my job and did not work with me on my hours. The hardest part of my job was standing behind the desk for most of the day and having to repeatedly ask for somebody to pick up a phone. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers and giving them advice on choosing clothes."
good,Excelente ambiente de trabalho com muitas pessoas competentes e que se preocupa muito com o meio ambiente.
good,"A typical day at work would mean that I would fill an average of 350 prescriptions as the only pharmacist on duty for a 12 hour shift....very stressful to say the least. I have learned that I can not do it all, without the support of the company and my co-workers. The most enjoyable parts of the job are my fellow co-workers and my customers. It has been a joy opening and operating a pharmacy from the first day of opening. More specifically, watching my business grow due to the hard work and efforts made by our staff."
good,"Certain members of management were fair. Many co-workers put down anyone that may be different. Honest, hard work."
good,"Dealing with a bunch of different people, co workers were ok, there was no hard part of the job"
good,"Cashierign; Layaway, Site-2-Store, Front End. Processing transactions(cash, check credkit/debit, wic, etc.,). Daily customer interface."
good,I usually work During on weekends and pick shifts on week days.
good,My typical day at work here was filled with a lot of customers and managers. Very fast paced.
good,"Not over all a bad job, but they will abuse salary. the promised pay of equivalent to $18.29 an hour is a joke, It is equivalent if you work a 40 hour week, but you are never scheduled less than 48 and usually more. No holiday pay, sick or anyother pay except 1 week vacation, that must be taken all at once and counts your regularly scheduled day off ( so really 3 days vacation.)"
good,Average place to work. No creativity or attempts to improve the job are allowed.
good,"Cashiering, restocking front end candy, and some days I work the service desk."
good,"Overall management worked with employees to meet personal needs for scheduling or family issues. Co-workers were pleasant to be around. Hardest part of the job was angry customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of helping customers. I learned a lot about the different cell phone services, types of phones and internet capabilities. A typical day consisted of selling cell phone and internet products, completing new contracts and stocking."
good,"I love my job at WalMart , but the I am looking for work that helps me grow more in the IT field"
good,"Unload trailers and process the freight and throw 3000 cases a day on the conveyer belts. Management was very degrading. Co-workers were great if they lasted. Most enjoyable thing about the job was working 3 days a week, 12hr days."
good,Typical work day consisted of comming into the photo lab and picking up the customer drop offs. we would clean the machinery every morning and every night. We took customer orders and made suggestions. On slow days I would help other areas of the store who need items stocked or organized. My co-workers worked well with each other but mostly kept to themselves. The management at our particular Wal Mart is pretty rough and inconsistant. One manager would tell you to do one task while another comes and coaches you for doing the task then would assign you another.
good,"The walmart store i worked for wasnt all bad. Some of the managers there were reasonable but most of them abused there position of power, took out aggresion and anger on lower employees, and were never fully satisfied with the work done even though conditions sometimes hindered productivity. Empty promises and lack of communication is what drove me to leave this company. All in all its a good starting point but i wouldnt recommend a career here unless you have management experience and start out in a leadership role because most employees under management are mistreated."
good,"management is very rude there, hours are poor, the pay is ok, but good placde forstudents"
good,good fast pace work with a lot of smiling face. if you are a people person this would be the place to work and extend your customer service values.
good,"a typical day at wal-mart nightshift is basically working the product to the floor and binning the product in the backroom, management can be very tough, but they will always listen to you if you have any questions or concerns, your coworkers could be family or friends, they will be there to help you, or if they need help, the hardest part of the job is completing all of the jobs that the managers give you, and trying to keep them happy. the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you are going to work knowing that the products that you handle will be bought by someone"
good,"A day at work when arrive the amount of freight that has come in for the night, Down load freight onto the floor or plates. Then go to the aisle assigned and proceed to stock shelves. Management is tolerable. The most important part of the job was rewarding when a good job was done."
good,"Walmart is only good for people with no families. No children, No spouse. Long term associates beware.You are on corporate radar."
good,The hardest part of the job was the non-fixed schedule. working in this company is rated average.
good,"Worked my way up from cashier, pay wasn't too great as hourly (Non-Supervisor) but it keeps you happy."
good,OK place to start off some managers where horrible but nice co-workers and customers for the most part
good,Trabalhava no atendimento ao cliente no setor de friambéria e também aprendi trabalhar no setor de açougue. Sempre tratei meus superiores com educaçaõ e respeito. Tinha um otimo relacionamento com meus colegas de trabalho. Sempre procurei dar bom atendimento aos cliente muito exigente. Sempre oferecer o melhor de mim
good,"None stop work, Do more then what you were hired for in different positions, and you dont work to make yourself look good, you work to make the managers look good and get the credit."
good,Walmart Distribution is a fast paced environment. You must stay on track everyday to complete all tasks in a days time. Very physical and hands on.
good,"We worked from the time we started until the end of the shift. I learned that most managers really didn't care for the issues in our personal lives, so they seemed heartless. I loved my co-workers. They were always very helpful and enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude and inconsiderate managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the company of co-workers."
good,School Scedule
good,"You do the same work everyday, or you might get lucky and get put on projects around the store. I like my co-workers and some of my managers other than that, the pay could be much better. The people with more experience should have gotten paid for that."
good,10 to 12 hours per day especially in smaller stores. Learned an incredible inventory system and sales displays. Management is detrimental when 1 is on duty from 5pm to 11pm. Never get out of store within the first hour after closing. It's hard when co-workers don't share the workload. Hardest part was managers didn't document disciplinary actions. The most enjoyable part was seeing individuals recognized for their accomplishments.
good,"worked with good people but management could answer any questions, to many cheifs not enough indians"
good,"Job expectancy is high with little compensation but they work around other schedule, for those with another job or going to school, very well"
good,Wal mart is a place to work when you are desperately in need of a job.
good,"A typical day was spent selling flowers and related things, stocking and rotating product. I worked closely with the management in my department and found that they seemed to be concerned with the productivity of the department but fail to show any concern for the personal welfare of their employees."
good,You don't get paid enough to deal with what you have to deal with. My CSM were really nice and understanding and tried to make your day better. Management would talk to you and not act like they were better than you. Very friendly enviorment.
good,Unfortunately this job was seasonal and when the next season came around I had already found myself other employment
good,"Not a good company for a mother, not really cooperative with helping with scheduling needs"
good,I was a Customer Service Manager. Its a alright place to work. does give hours
good,"I believe that Walmart has prepared me and provided me with skills that will help me in any other job field. During my day at work I am in a team environment with allotted task for particular jobs. Working in the garden center, my team takes care of the seasonal merchandise. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the relationships formed with the satisfied customers. The hardest part of the job would be keeping my quality as high as the volume of customers during peak seasons."
good,The hours are pretty good but the management is horrible. the co workers gossip all day and ignore the customers and complaints. I learned to have patience with the customers. I enjoyed interacting with the customers. The hardest part of this retail is the holiday and the long standing hours but other then that this job is decent.
good,really bad managers ran that store for way too long and they run off a lot of good people.
good,The company as a whole was great until new practices such as cutting hours and only being able to advance if you are believed to be a good employee came into play. There's a lot of finger pointing and blame when there shouldn't be any and a lot of mismanagement that the home office does not hear about.
good,"The hours are long, the pay is average. There is really no opportunity for advancement unless you are willing to move. There are no raises, at all. There is a possibility of a small bonus in December, but that is a very small possibility. Management is nice, they are very willing to help and make sure you have the training you need. The job is really quite easy, anyone can do it. That being said, there are very few challanges and it can get monotonus. You have no co-workeers, this is a job in which you will be working individually at all times. You get to learn all the ins and outs of a Walmart store, which is interesting. The Walmart managers, for the most part, will try to help out with anything you need. Many of the Walmart employees are very nice and funny, it is enjoyable to spend hours with them in each store."
good,"In the jewelery dept, my co-workers are great. We truely have a team spirit. However the store as a whole, does not. To me, that makes this a hard place to work for."
good,Cato is a very good company to work for. I enjoyed my time there very much. A typical day at Cato would start off with a list of task that were to be completed before the end of your shift. Management was for the most part informative making sure you had everything needed to do the job successfully. My coworkers were nice and easy to get along with. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was interacting with the customers and making sure that their shopping experience was enjoyable. The most important thing I learned was how to multitask and manage my time effectively not only to make sure customers were attended to but that the tasks were complete in a timely matter. The most difficult part of this job was to manage time because customers want your full attention and you have tasks that have to be completed before leaving for the evening but overall I handled them with a positive attitude and made sure everything was done correctly and on time.
good,My review of walmart is all I did is work for a paycheck when I first stared workuing there I loved it then things started going down hill. A typical day would be hectic because most of the time i worked along and some days I would be super busy. The management had no respect for us and treated us like we were their kids. The hardest part about my job was being away from my daughter all the time because i was always scheduled second shift and I wasnt able to be home with her as much. Over all it was a ok job but I didn't enjoy it much.
good,Walmart is a good company though before they said people can have adjustable work schedules but it seems sometimes they give the employees options to take the job or leave...but in terms of the surrounding and some of the people it is a good company.
good,i liked working there. i like helping people and you get to meet a lot of people. i didnt like the hours they dont give you no more than 30 a week and you get paid every other week.
good,notre condition de travaille n'a jamais été attendu par nos supérieur concernant sur la méthode et notre sécurité
good,"Walmart is a substandard company. The hourly employees are worked to the bring of madness while management stays in the office playing on the computers. If you request a day off, you are treated as though you are robbing the place. If you are ill, you get nothing but the third degree. The proclaim to be ""family oriented"", however the only families that get anything out of it is those of the managers. If the co-workers get along, they hassel you and fun is not allowed."
good,"The Deli Dept is perhaps the most stressful dept and it's even labeled as such by Wal mart themselves. However, the fast pace and demand makes the time fly. I did enjoy night stocking as it allows a break from the hussle bussle of the day. The supervisors walk around to do here and there checks, otherwise your left alone. I liked knowing my job well enough that I'd build up a fast pace and take off till a break or lunch was called."
good,"Wal-Mart gave me a lot of opportunity to learn a variety of things, but at the same time the more you learn the more you'll get used. My co-workers were okay to be around but at the same time it was just a job, management is who you would really have to look out for..."
good,"Advancement opportunities are hard to come by. Very slow advancement. Beaurocratic culture, rather than customer and employee driven."
good,A typical day at work was laughs and getting to talk to customers all the time. It taught me to be humble in every situation.
good,i would come in check on my depts. and the backroom to see what needed to be done that da.
good,"In a typical day i had to help a wide range of customers, from young children to the elderly, people with disabilities to the hard day at work just want to go home people."
good,Okay ... Culture is weird and insulated. Internal management extremely limited.
good,"I would normally come into work and cleanup the backroom/cooler that the morning crew could not get around to. Then I would stock the sales floor with fruits and vegetables until my lunch break. Afterwards, I'll clean and organize the backroom for the morning crew and then I'll go home. I didn't learn anything new because I've done the job before, but I did enjoy working with my co-workers. They were nice and friendly and we all got along really well. The synergy we had made work very efficient. The management was readily available if you needed anything, but they weren't timely with getting back with you about most things."
good,"Work hard, pick up extra shifts/overtime and get full-time"
good,conferem e armazenam produtos e materiais em depósitos. Fazem os lançamentos da movimentação de entradas e saídas e controlam os estoques. Distribuem produtos e materiais a serem expedidos. Organizam o estoque para facilitar a movimentação dos itens armazenados e a armazenar.
good,"Aunque la presion en algunas epocas del mes debido al cumplimiento de metas es fuerte, el ambiente laboral y el apoyo de los jefes directos es muy bueno, ademas de la confianza en el manejo de los medios laorales."
good,Not a place to start a career but good place for in need of cash.
good,i do my job and i do it well i will not bad mouth the company yet i will not lie if you want to know how good something is you stay away from it if you want to know the bad with the good than you work for that company but i will not talk bad about any company that i work for. due to the people i work with it is a fun environment and we all make the time go fast i just wish that walmart would have a more set schedule for employment instead they throw your schedule around from night to day shift day to day work that is walmart take it or leave it your choice.
good,"I basically would come in to a fitting room full of returns about 5 to 6 baskets full. I would have it all put up within 4 hours of beign at work. Management was not that good at the time, the hardest part of the job was doing my job and picking up multiple task, but at the end of the shift the job was done. the co workers and customers were my motivation to coming to work, even though it wasnt always pleasant they would make your day."
good,my job at walmart was ok but i am looking for something way better. management did not know how to do half the things that i knew how to do. poor scheduleing. co-workers were great.
good,This is a fast pace environment. One must be willing to produce on a fast pace at all times.
good,"Uma boa experiencia trabalho dinanmico direto com clientes de todas as classes sociais aprendi a lidar com varias situaçoes, aprendi muito com meu gerente que e um cara muito bem sucedido detro do walmart e muito inteligente. A parte mais dificil era o dia de receber o salario mensal ao saber que se deu tanto lucro para a empresa e n receber nada a mas por isso."
good,"Walmart was a good first job, I enjoy being around people very much. Manaagement was terrible and to this day still is. I dont really remember anything hard about walmart"
good,"I enjoyed the people i worked with. However, I did no enjoy some of the politics at Walmart. Really the job was easy. Some management made you wonder how they got the position. Overall okay place to work."
good,"Help customers, I made sure the merchandise was good and clean, I unloaded the trucks, I helped the customer make the best decesion possible"
good,"Most days are challenging because we, as the overnight crew, are always busy. We are the team that is responsible for maintaining instock for our business; so, there is a lot of pressure in what we do."
good,There was alot of work to be done with such little pay. Other than that it was great!
good,"is pays slightly more than minimum wage but they are very picky, about many things, especially about what women are and are not allowed to do that men are allowed to do."
good,"You get what you put into it, you can make it fun to endure the challenging work environment. You learn to eith er develop new commujication skills to intereact with the customers daily or pack up an go...either way you work at Walmart you can work anywhere"
good,"I never wanted to work at Walmart, but enjoyed it for the most part. I do feel as though I got paid well there. I do have to say that my supervisors were great but upper management was fair form ideal."
good,"Come in, unload truck with mostly unproductive employees who spend a lot of time on their phone."
good,walmart was a job i took to have money in my pocket but it was cool to work here and see everything that people were buying i learned how to handle large amounts of cash and check cashing
good,I would unload freight trucks and stock the merchandise in its proper place on the sales floor. I would also manage inventory on all merchandise that came in through vendors. The managers were decent but they could have been a lot more understanding and easy-going and my co-workers were great. The hardest part about the job would be having two to three freight trucks at a time on the same day and having to unload at least two of them. The most enjoyable part about the job for me would be lunch because they had a variety of different foods and places you could go to eat inside the store.
good,This is a great place if work is your life. They promote you and you have a great ability to grow in the company
good,One thing I didnt like about Walmart is that they made my family come after my job. That should not be that way. Family should come first.
good,"Esta empresa ofrecia muy buenas condiciones salariales, pero habia un pesimo ambiente laboral. Aprendi a trabajar con objetivos y en grupo. Me gusto todo el trabajo excepto por el ambiente laboral."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers.
good,"Continuously over ordering and cutting hours while being understaffed, some managers use their authority to satisfy personal vendettas"
good,this is an ok place to work great stepping stone but not a life long comment
good,"A typical day at work involves: receiving trucks, finalizing goods, and inventory control. I have learned how to receive trucks, finalize, and control the inventory through the smart system which is a computer-based program that manages the stores inventory. Management is helpful with any problems and the co-workers are genuine individuals that are easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy boxes over 50lbs and the most enjoyable is helping other associates with their needs."
good,I worked for walmart 2+ years. I love working in the public so this was a geeat place for me. Co workers wre friendly and so were the csr.
good,Typical day at Walmart was productive and cooperative due to the wide range of experiences and clients. At Walmart I enjoyed engaging potential training needs within our groups and address them in a timely manner. As part of the management team we ensure that our coworkers had the most up to date information on everything from our ample inventory to monetary incentives to promote a more engaged worker in their areas and thus happy clients.
good,"las horas de trabajo muy largas y tediosas estar todo el dia de parado, manejo de la caja, buen ambiente de trabajo con los compañeros"
good,The swing employee's are unhappy. Supervisor's are rude to customers and do not connect well with the employee's
good,"I would help customers, stock, answer phone calls, work the cash register. I learned how to work at a group and also how to work alone, I learned how to work with customers, how to manage my time and get things done on time but at the same time doing it right.the coworkers were helpful depending on who I was working with but i managed to get by with who I had that day. The managers were okay, of course i had my favorite, but at the end of the day i could work with all of them. the hardest part was learning how wal-mart did there work, compared to my old retail jobs. the most enjoyable part of the job was when I had certain customers come in and ask for me."
good,"Like many in America, I do not agree with the social or cultural stance Walmart has taken. Both in the US or throughout the World. However, as an employer I'd say they are among one of the best. The pat is about average for what a retail chain is but other than that I enjoyed my time at Walmart and am sad that I ended up leaving the company due to a move out of state."
good,Working at walmart has had its ups and downs. I have learned many thing from working there. The managment team there are a few good ones and a few not so good ones
good,"Scannning merchandise.. ignoring rude customers, because you will have them."
good,"Unless you are a full time Associate you have very few rewards. You do get a Wal-mart discount card after working there for 90 days. But this card only works on certain items and most of those items are junk food and non consumables. Typically there are several other associates working at the same time. Although it says that wasting time (i.e. standing around doing nothing or just talking instead of working) is against store policy, I see it every day. I work very hard and make sure I get as much as I can done in the time that has been given to me. I don't get treated any different than the associates that don't finish their tasks and wander off to talk to other associates. Stocking shelves is always a lot of work especially when working in chemicals. I have strained my should several times lifting large bottles of laundry detergent and bleach."
good,"A typical night consisted of checking out customers, and seperating returns from the customer service desk as well as cleaning the front end of the store and restocking the shelves."
good,"I was part-time and usually worked evenings. I worked in the jewellery department and the cosmetic department. I learned a lot about how to look for good gold and where to look to make sure it was real. I worked a bit on watches from changing batteries, the straps and opening it up to see if i could find what the problem was. The co-workers were not very nice and that was a big issue. It didnt make me motivated to go to work."
good,"um dia detrabalho bem estrssantre,com muitas Nf para dá conta e fazer pedidos,os colegas são bastante companheiros.Lutar pára bater a meta é sempre um bom desafio."
good,"I was hired in as a part time cashier, and was then asked to learn the routine at the Customer Service Desk. At the Customer Service Desk, I was responsible for answering the phone, taking calls from customers with questions and resolving issues that arise. I also handled returns, or exchanges for merchandise. I also helped customers resolve problems or complaints with a calm and personable frame of mind."
good,Cool job steady work with a lot of people who will help you learn your job and hold you accountable for you doing what the job require
good,Usually really busy all day. I've learned there's alot of interesting people out there and have might alot of interesting people to talk to.Takes alot of wear and tear on your knees and back just standing.
good,"Less than 40 hours a week. Didnt hire full time. Hours vary and different hours. Cashed people out, stocked shelves. Co-workers were good to work with. Management could of been better with helping in certain things."
good,"I worked in the garden department. Checking customers out. Stocking merchandise, moving, etc."
good,I learned a tremendous amount while working at Wal-Mart. I had the opportunity to get involved with various activities on the Corporate campus in addition to my day job.
good,This is a place to work when you have no other options. The pay is decent as far as other retail positions go. In my experience management was unhappy and grumpy. Hated their jobs/lives and it was obvious. I tried to go above and beyond my duties as a cashier and always seemed to be punished because of that.
good,Typical Work Day: Most of the time it was fun.
good,"Many days at Walmart, we were very under staffed. Pushed to extremes to complete long projects in short time frames. It was very stressful"
good,A typical day of work includes a lot of notes with little help to complete. Walmart is very short staffed. The less people they have to pay. I have learned a great deal about retail management. The hardest part of my job is being pulled in many directions without allowing me to complete one task first. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work closely with.
good,"I return shopping carts of food back on the shelf, I stock food products, and zone the grocery area. I learned that I can keep a job for 4 plus years. Management is okay but they have a lot of growing to do. I really like my co-workers. I enjoy being there part-time. The hard part is not having a career job that I'm happy with."
good,"Sem aborrecimentos e com rendimento no serviço´, ter respeito pelo individuio, trabalho com qualidade e pordutividade, otimos profucionas,quando você não consegui realizar o trabalho ate o final do dia, a satisfação do dever cumprido"
good,"From late 2003 on, I am truly thankful the majority of my time was overnight. Most of the time I worked in the canned goods aisle alone. I liked being kept to myself."
good,very different to work but i did enjoyed it...Wal-Mart was a little hard because of standing up for hours
good,It's not a bad place to work. There are just a lot of hard workers that are underpaid. It is also hard to advance fast at WalMart.
good,its a ok workplace but managers need to help out more. very easy job.
good,Work was easy but lack of management knowledge was a hinderance to doing a good job for the customer. Customers were the best.
good,"Enjoyed working at Walmart, the employees were always nice, the customers were great . Hated standing on my feet for so long, pay was ok"
good,"I would say walmart has good benefits, the managers are knowledgeable for store operations but not for individual departments. They make sure everyone on the clock is working and not standing around, which is a good thing for the company. Overall it was an okay company to work for. As long as you don't make any mistakes."
good,NIce place to work are at times willing to work with you on your schedule can get a bit hard around the holiday session.
good,it was a fast past job get the orders in in out and we use to say i need a spicy to move
good,Low standard depending on department managers. If you have good leadership it's a great environment. Days drag on if the management is sub par
good,"Some need a check on how they manage people, bulling is something that should be addressed. Sadly it is never addressed. It is seen as a ""strong work ethics"", In reality its just plan bulling. they say one thing and do another. You should get time off after working 17 days, but sadly no, you work more and everyday. you are expected to work 20 hours and not sleep much. If you are a workaholic this job is for you."
good,"A typical work day at Walmart is always fast paced. Walk into work with a positive attitude, and for some reason you always seem to leave with a negative one. Either the customers, coworkers, or managers have said something to upset you."
good,Mostly The Same Exact Work Everyday. You Rarely Learn New Things. The Managment Is The Worst. Most Co-Workers Are Wonderful. The Hardest Part Of The Job Is Dealing With The Managers. The Most Enjoyable Part Is Working With The Co-Workers.
good,"A typical day pushed carts and greeted people and from time to time helped other associates... I learned better people skills . The management was Average . My co-workers were helpful, encouraging and fun. The hardest part was getting used to pushing carts, but the most enjoyable part was the fact that i was pushing carts even tho it was in the sun ."
good,Your work day stays busy all day and time passes very fast. You meet some very interesting people and alot of diversity is needed as Customer Service Manager. I enjoyed working with the public and getting to know many of my employees.
good,"I learned that working with people can be fun, a typical day at work consisted of just working until breaks and being pushed to be better at what we did."
good,Able to change jobs within the company; learn many different aspects of the retail business.
good,"I did not feel like a person, i felt like an ant. I work as hard and as loyal as i do and i did not get the experance i wanted to try and move on up."
good,Walmart has good Management but lacks in communication between the different stages of Managers. This causes problems with accountability for personnel with time off as well as where is the stock.
good,aveces el cliente es complicado y te termina amargando la tarde
good,My time was short there yes but I still talk with those I worked with. It almost seems to stand still in who stands there.
good,not family orientated. but i did learn a variety of trades and posisitions
good,"The two 15 minutes breaks are wonderful in the summer time. I worked in Lawn & Garden where it was always hot. The A.C. unit did not for some of the time that I was employed. I learned great communication skills and how to get along with just about anyone. My co-workers were fun to work with and we always worked as a team to complete our daily to-do lists. We all had something in common. I would say the hardest part of the job was seeing customers upset about a situation that was out of my control. The most enjoyable part of the job, was meeting new people everyday. As for management, it could be better in my opinion."
good,"I worked hard answeing the phones, keeping the fitting room clean, unload clothes out of boxes and put them in correct place. I multi-task threw out my day."
good,"As a Wal-Mart cashier, I dealt with unhappy customers and dysfunctional machines everyday. The job itself was extremely easy, but also quite boring and tedious. Personally, I like to keep busy and constantly work, and that was sometimes difficult to achieve. Management is understaffed and not always well trained. Like myself, my co-workers found themselves doing the same tedious tasks everyday and dealing with several unhappy people due to the lack of properly functioning equipment and poor management. I learned how to make customer's laugh and forgive the companies mistakes. That was quite possibly the most enjoyable part of my job. The hardest part of my job was by far the lack of flexibility."
good,"we have meetings at the beinning of the shift and what i learned it have a since of urgency, to have pride in my work, to be a team player and to be a leader . And management are great role model . And co-workers great to be around . The hardest part of my work is inventory cause we always never have room in the back warehouse and enjoyable thing there is greating bonuses"
good,The typical work day I greet the customer and chat with them as I am scanning their items. Management is understanding and while I don't agree with some of the rules for the most part they are a good company to work for. They supply lunches for so many day without an accident and quarterly bonus checks depending on how well the store does.
good,The work was good and the condition were ok but the management wasn't always fair. Lack of professionalism.
good,"Worked very hard at my position as ICS Lead, all of my employees cried when i left. I enjoyed the hours and the people i worked with."
good,I would check customers out that made purchases. My drawer would be even every time. I would help customers find ideas or direct them to where they could find it.
good,"Wal-Mart is a great job, if you don't have a family to support and you just need to get by. It was not job that I could have sustained and gotten anywhere in, unfortunately."
good,"when you think of working at walmart you don't think its as stressful or drama filled but truth is, its more like my old high school the pay is horrible its min wage (which fine for high schoolers) but for a mom of 2 its not the best choice to make. i love the fact i meet so many people and im not stuck in a small office. the management does work with you for the most the most part as far as if you need a day off or change your hours for a certain day. A typical day for me is coming in and having to do returns which means empty out both sides of fitting rooms and put it back out on the sales floor, while being called up to cashier bc of all the customers, or answer the phones and help direct the customers call to right area or sometimes you have to go across the store to look up an item for them if nobody else answers. When you cashier sometimes you get some crabby people who will look for anything to complain about you have to just smile and let them know your trying your best, i deal with all this craziness easier than my coworkers i think bc of me working in nursing for over 6 yrs you are short staffed, overworked, and at times have to deal with unhappy people :)"
good,walmart is a good place to learn work ethic and the work enviroment is not the greatest enviroment to be working in but they pay enoufh to keep a roof over someones head
good,"My typical day at work, i go in at 10pm and get my telezon, find out what department I'm working in and then i pull out all of the merchandise that can be stocked and take it to the floor. When i am done with my department i go and help other departments. When i return from lunch i bin in all overstock from the fresh freight for the night. Once i am done i go home. I am pretty much on my own unless i run into a problem, then i find a manager for direction."
good,"Worked both in corporate offices and in store, will have to say it was a great learning experience, but after the death of Mr. Sam the company began to take on the 'Big Company' feel. The benefits are fairly good, but the job requirements can be a little stressful. The chance for advancement rests solely on your own shoulders, but it is there. But you have to be very productive, they do some firing of dead wood at times."
good,Management staff are not fair and employees do not get recognition beyond pay.
good,es una buena empresa pero lo que si es que casi no te dejan superarte subir de puesto
good,"Walmart is a cool job to catch up on bills. You get a bonus every 3 months for employees who have worked 6 months and a discount card, but i really would not make that a long term job.Management is not that hands on wit there workers. The store could get really messy, and they give you so many hours hard to balnace with home life."
good,"I first find my produce manager and ask her what she would like for me to get started on,most of the time its filling and culling diffrent sections.I also do through aways marking things off by using a gemeni.Sometimes a asst manager will have me working in outher departments mostly the bakery floor stocking putting sell buy stickers on things,i like this because i get to use the gemeni and printer.some managers i like some i dont.I really have alot of respect for my produce manager she is a great person to work for.Some of my coworkers complane alot and i dont want to hear it . Most of my co workers work as a team and thats what i like.I like telling customers where to find things,i know the store well.I cant think off anything very hard,maybe learning all the functions on the gemeni."
good,"Typical job with typical pay, huge company so you are just a number"
good,I like working for Walmart. The benefits were good. I worked overnight shift. It was like a Walmart Family.
good,"A typical work day would involve lots of customer service, dealing with difficult people, checking in fright using store software, putting away freight and keeping your area clean and tidy. I learned to use a cash register and retail software to do my job. Management needs help with people skills and dealing with difficult people. My co-workers were great. We were one team always helping each other when the need arose. The hardest part of my job was doing a modulare and then being asked to do it over in another place in the store because management decided they did not like it where it originally was set up. Customers were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"After clocking in report to register, open up cash drawer, greet customers and keep work area neat. When not busy with customers associates should be redlining(attracting customers to register for check out) or ""recovering""(adjust merchandise on shelves to attain a purchasable approach for customers)."
good,•a typical day at work:60
good,For the most part you meet people from all over the world
good,"The people who work for walmart are wonderful especially the ones who have been there for years, they know what it was when sam was alive. My manager was great! He would help with anything and talk to you like an acutal human although not all managers are the same... my dept. was lucky. But all the changes walmarts are making, that are coming down from home office are crazy. that dont make any sense and changes the way things have ran smoothly for years. i think sam walton would go crazy if he knew what they were changing."
good,The best part of this job was working with the customers and the fact that it stayed busy so my day always went by fast. The only thing I didn't like about the job was the fact that it was so unorganized and the managers didn't always show respect.
good,"Very stressfull, fast pace environment, seems we are pushed for speed before acuracy"
good,The great thing about Walmart is job security. There's always going to be a Walmart. And typically don't have to worry about being fired unless you have messed up big time.
good,My experience was quite memorable. I assisted in building the store.I appreciated my mgrs. encouragements.
good,"The typical day at work was very busy, most of my time spent running a register. When I wasn't at my register, I was usually performing 2 or 3 jobs at once. I learned to work with anyone, and how to handle unruly customers with a smile. Managment was very hands on, almost a little too hands on. Some days it felt more like micro-management. My co-workers were great, and usually made working more fun. I would have to say, the people I worked with were the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job was the astronomically high expecations corporate forced management to hold us to, there were definitely not enough employees to accomplish each night what they wanted us to."
good,"A typical night working at Walmarts consisted of being short handed, rude customers, and not enough bags."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart consisted of stocking shelves, handling customer cares, and helping out where needed. What little time I was there I learned that participating in a team effort was the fastest way to get the job done. Management was normally made up of the people that had worked there the longest and had the most experience with their department. My co-workers were always friendly and determined individuals who mastered multi-tasking. The hardest thing about the job was finding the time to be everywhere at once. Due to being short staffed, you could never focus on your departments actual needs. But knowing that the people I worked with were working just as hard as I was, made the work day go by with ease."
good,"working with customers, and good co-workers is what makes it nice to be there. but in the end the main managment at this store dosent care about there employes"
good,Wal-Mart was very displeasing atmosphere to work. I had enjoyed retail so much in the past that I felt it was time to leave the medical fiend and go work for one of the largest companies. I was disappointed within my first year that I was passed over several times for advancement. I had experience and knowledge but this was not enough.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of watering the plants, cleaning up excessive plant debris on the patio and then stocking missing items."
good,"Very easy work but a little bit strenuous. Salary does not commensurate the job. Co-workers are great, however, it is very hard to adjust to working the 3rd shift"
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. I enjoyed my job because I had alot of one on one with the customers.
good,Everyday you learn something new that may have change over night and you have to be prepare for changes and short notication. I deeply express with my co-workers comminication can solve a lot problems before hand. Different levels of situation arising with customer concerns and assuring customer satisfaction. Working with a group of people that believes in team work and getting the job done also looking back at watch we accomplished as a team so everyone can reap the rewards. Thats what I most enjoyed about the job.
good,"It was a decent job reason why I say that is,the compensation I was getting for overnight couldve been better,and the managers cluld show some more respect and appricate thier workers more"
good,loved working with customers managment is very horriable co workers were good also most enjoyed helping customers find what they need and help out around the store
good,Over worked and under paid. Health insurance will get you into a doctor and that is about it.
good,Employment at Walmart was a friendly environment that provided me with business related experience that could serve as a beneficiary in future endeavors and career development. Backroom inventory would serve as a prime example of such a statement as well as my experience with maintenance which enhanced my ability of becoming a team player to complete tasks. Management was organized and helpful as well as co workers and the most difficult part of the job was completing tasks due to the lack of an efficient amount of co workers. the most enjoyable part of the job was the time spent with embracing co workers.
good,"I was given the opportunity to experience different jobs, which added to my experience as a well rounded retail associate"
good,A typical night working at Walmart from the hours of 10 pm - 7 am would be different. Reason why I say different is because of the strange customers that would come in that time of night/morning. I learned what Walmart employees have to go thru with customers having attitudes. Management was the worst on third shift other employees working that same shift tried to voice the problems that the management was having but nothing was ever done about it. The hardest part of the job was the hours and the most enjoyable part was my co-workers.
good,"Heavy work loads with little to no real training, CBL (computer based learning) they are your bread and butter the longer you can drag them out without going late the better. You can realistically waste your first two to three weeks doing them. You will make good friends but remember that their open door conversations always leak out so be prepared for the repercussions of what you say. Your management team will try to make you work far more then you should doing tasks that you will never get trained to do. If you can make it the five years to get vested then its harder for them to terminate you for anything. Also try to avoid overtime because they hate to pay for it and they will cut hours on you if you do it to much."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work for if you like going through the motions and being under minded by customers daily. Management will tell you to back their policies but when a customer does not like a certain policy that you enforce, they will make you look like you do not know what you are doing by overriding that policy just to please a disgruntled customer."
good,As an hourly employee great experience. Expectations known and reasonable to achieve.
good,"Although they speak highly of the culture that Sam Walton started, Walmart is a large corporation. and it is only as ""nice"" as the local leadership."
good,"8 hours of cart pushing a day, Retail experience, management was terrible and they treated me badly, had made some good friends there. Hardest part of job was working in the weather, most enjoyable part of job was making friends and good pay check."
good,Lower Level Cashiers are treated horrible. Sometimes you are threathen to stay at work If they are low on staff. Management is horrible. The hardest part of the job was walking through the door. The most enjoyable part of the job was the small 10% discount.
good,If you like to work by your self and only talk to customers its the job for you
good,Wal-Mart is fine if you need a paycheck. My current management team is pitted against each other by the store manager and this creates conflict from the top down. I've many years there so its not all that bad. As long as you show up to work and don't steal its hard to get fired.
good,"greeting customers maintaining carts , checking receits and returns as needed, naintaining clean area"
good,* All over night shift for four days in a week.
good,"I had a bad experience with them. I moved from Denham Springs, La to Harvey, La and 'thought' I was transferring to a store in this area and come to find out I had been terminated due to 'job abandonment. It left a sour taste in my mouth."
good,I just didn't really like the cashier position; I was pregnant at the time and couldn't stand to be standing in one place for a long time. I would have prob liked in more if I was staying busy with something in the background or something like cleaning or stocking shelves. A cashier position at WalMart just isn't for me that's why I quit.
good,The job isn't horrible. It isn't the most highly recommended company to work for. Management changes the way they want things handled on a daily basis without warning. Management is quick to jump down your throat if you don't make expected work times for you assigned work areas. There is constantly a double standard. The smokers get more breaks than the non smokers because most of management smokes. Some people get treated like they walk on water and others can't sneeze without getting into trouble.
good,Entertaining company to work for. Work is very busy and sometimes challenging.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my day is working with the customers. I have learned a lot such as laws, money transfers..."
good,stressful job
good,Walmart is a great first job as long you not have kids who get sick a lot.
good,"This was my second job here in Memphis, while in college. I worked long hours that left me with little to no time to spend with my family. When I requested lesser hours, the manager told me that that was not possible."
good,"I only worked for the company for a short time but during this time Wal Mart gave me something that they offer no one; they promoted me to full time. I learned to work a cash register for the first time. Most of the co-workers were great but there were many slackers and I cannot tolerate slackers. Hardest part of the job was the work schedule hours, different daily. I prefer a set schedule. I enjoyed meeting the customers."
good,"Pay aside, this isn't all that bad of a place to work. You get to use your creativity albeit in a limited capacity, and you're thrust into dealing with every sort of customer imaginable. Eventually, you feel interconnected with your co-workers, and advancement opportunities are available if (and only if) you do the groundwork first."
good,wal mart works you as hard as you will let them and still ask for more givin you the minimal raise everytime
good,Would have been a good place to work if it wasnt for the supervising staff that didnt care bout your babysitting situation and wouldnt let you work a different shift or department of the store
good,"Unfortunately with this position held, it was hard to balance life and work. Working overnights took a tole on my sleep schedule as well as my family life. I personally had to search for another job that was during the day since they did not want to transfer me to days."
good,"overall wal-mart is a good company to work for, but it lacks good management."
good,Its an ok job if you have the right management team. There is a high turnover because of the fact there are alot of people who fall through the cracks and do not like doing work.
good,"I loved my job as a customer service representative, but the management there was not good at all."
good,"Walmart, as a whole, was a great opportunity for a person to sart at the bottom and work their way to the top."
good,"I like working at Walmart. The environment is a pleasant one and co-workers are very friendly. Only complaint is management doesn't always do what they say they are going to do, and sometimes take forever to change things in the system."
good,Unloading & loading trucks
good,Unloading merchandise trucks and assisting customers
good,"I started here as a cashier, and within 6 months was a CSM, I loved being a CSM I was always moving and keeping busy, my co-workers were amazing, and the customers were generally very nice people. I had a child and CSM hours did not work with being a single mom, so I steppped down to be the lead in the hard ware/ paint department, I always had great customers, and enjoyed the returning ones! The hardest part of this job was having to step down and lose my management position"
good,"A typical day requires unloading delivery truck, breaking down pallets of frozen merchandise and placing the merchandiser on store shelves inside freezers. The hardest part of the job is getting everyone on the same page and feeling like a team. Managers are always stating that teamwork can get alot done but that is not what I see nor feel. There is no teamwork in Walmart, it is eveyone man and woman for themselves."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart can be sometimes exciting and sometimes stressful. Working with the public you come in contact with many people some loyal and many rude...a positive mind frame and respectful attitude will get you through any situation at Wally World :). The management team at Wal-Mart seems a little stressful, if the position is for you, you can survive. I love my co-workers, we all have ours days but most of all if we can work together we can survive together. There isn't a hard part working at Wal-Mart, do your job, be honest and courteous, and have a nice day. The most enjoyable part about working for Wal-Mart is the people....yeaa alot them have bad days, but during my years in retail I have meet some of the most interesting people, some I see every single day. I appreciate the time, giving them the best customer service possible and helping me have a great day with just a smile."
good,I loved my job here. My fellow employees were great and the learning experience was wonderful. I enjoyed getting to work in almost every area of the store and meeting new people on a daily basis. The hardest part was resigning to move out of state.
good,"decorate cakes, assist customers, and stock shelves. created appealing cake designs to display to customers. Maintained a clean and safe working environment. Regularly checked supplies and freshness of ingredients. Placed orders to restock supplies when necessary"
good,The other employees at walmart are great to work with. Most of the CSM are very cool and laid back but there are a few who have messed up attitudes. The overall environment is a good/ fun place.
good,Not a dull moment or day. Definitely has it's challenges but that makes it more interesting.
good,"I get paid only 9.65$ per hour although, the work I have done is professional photography. I am suppose to get paid much more than that. In addition there has been no raise in my wages in nearly 2 years of working here."
good,"I had worked for Walmart super center store. It's a fun place to meet new people everyday; you get to work independently; you can choose the hours. But health insurance does not cover some needs like chiropractic services. Walmart is a good place for young people to work and support themselves through colleges. It's also good for disabled people to work part time and get to keep their SSDI benefits, too. Same for retired people to work there to supplement their retirement pension benefits. The pay is better for management level jobs. But the pay raise is only 35 cents to 60 cents for non-management level jobs. The best part about it is bonus surplus added to the paycheck if the store meets monthly profit goal every month. I would not mind to work part time for Walmart. If you want higher pay, bigger pay raise and better healh insurance coverage and especially retirement plan, it is better to seek jobs with other employers that can afford to give you more! It's okay to work for Walmart if you are looking for a part time job. That is all."
good,"working at walmart helped me in my customer skills, it showed me to smile even if the person was upset, it defuses the situation alittle. i learned to handle issues at the customer service desk and the transactions between both walmart and the customer."
good,for overnight crew a typical day would be to get the dept assigned stocked with the freight provided.Ive learned to manage my schedule between family and work and also how the stores get stocked so that people are able to shop for the things they need.Management from the time that i started have been very poor lack of communication between eachother and to employees.Hardest part of the job is having to stock while people are still shopping.what i really like most about working at walmart are the co workers they are very willing to help one another.
good,it was an ok job they just wasnt organized and did alot of calling you in on your off days but it was a good company to work for overall
good,"Clean,good people to work with.Had alot of cookouts.Had a few good pograms for familys."
good,"You can't get enough hours in order to make a living. The employees are good people, and some of Management is ok."
good,Job was okay just the pay was what you would expect from a multi billion dollar company.
good,i like working with Wal-Mart; my job and the assoicates that work with me. I do feel a little structure along with strategy is needed but other than that i really like what i do.
good,i work there for two years it was a great place though the supervisors and management teams could use a little work. otherwise great place to work
good,"There was no day that was ever the same. Some of the policies for returns were not the best of policies , which made some of the returns and it's customers a bit challenging."
good,"It is a retail company, therefore hours of work are as needed per business. Scheduling days off can be a hassle especially if you're a student or family oriented."
good,"walmart is a good company to work for, there will always be a job with walmart. they have flexible hours and managers who work with your scheduling needs."
good,"This was my first job and it was cool after I got dark from pushing carts, but overall this job was a stepping stone"
good,The time that I worked at Wal-Mart was a good experience and was a good learning experience for how a business should be run.
good,Fun workplace if you are a associate. Easy to learn there programs and systems.
good,Hard work can lead to fast advancement with this company. But be careful what you ask for because you can quickly become the fall guy for upper management. The blame for everything will fall on you if its your fault or not.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working here for more then a year but staying stagnant in title and salary while taking on much the responsibilities of my manager is difficult for more then just a couple of months. Organizational changes need to happen before I can say I'm happy here. But nonetheless the people are great and you can learn some great fundamentals of ecommerce here.
good,"I did not enjoy working at Wal-Mart at all. I felt very closed off. My shifts were always swinging. I could never plan free time. I was fired for something I did not even do, which they even admitted was their fault but refused to reverse their decision. I would NEVER work for them again."
good,"Sweet people love them, if they could help you they did if you did something for them like go in when they called you in."
good,It does have ups & downs but you stay outside no one bothers you when need but it good
good,The manger and assistant mangers were great to work for.Everyone knew what the task at hand was.So we all pitched in where ever the need for assistance was needed.That was the good thing about working for wal-mart Inc.
good,worked at walmart for over a year. employees are over worked. expecially over night staff.
good,This is a job that is great for college students to get customer service experience.
good,Sometimes it was a productive working environment. Some problems with members of management. Great associate working relationships.
good,"At one time the store seemed to be moving along pretty nicely, but after a short period of time things began to crumble with employees losing their jobs over unnecessary things, and people leaving due to unstable environment that became about and at times there was some flexibility with schedules, hours were as they should be and some change for good"
good,I enjoyed my job. I love helping and working with customers.
good,Working at Wal-Mart was a vary multi task job. I worked on cash registers also sometimes in Electronics. What I learned while working at Wal-Mart was to muli task and how to better help customers
good,The company is great...if you are at the top. If you are at the bottom you catch the backlash from higher-ups for their or their supervisor's incompetence.
good,"They have potential to be a good employer if they were efficient in communication between management and associates. The only downfall is they have is that they have a tendency to fire associates for issues that are easily fought and for actions of associates who are instructed with management approval to perform certain actions, which later end up costing many associates involved thier jobs and not that of the Higher management who initially granted permission of such transactions."
good,"An average day was fairly easy, as we just went in, grabbed tools, and started picking customer's orders off the shelves. Once all orders had been picked, we went to the back room to dispense the orders to the customer's cars. Management was unprofessional and unreliable, as we had a new manager every few months. Because said managers kept quitting, everyone's schedules were messed up. The hardest part of the job was collectively picking up the slack for our management. The easiest part was handling customer's requests, questions, and orders."
good,"working for wal-mart is not too bad, it is a good job for the most part, it makes a great job while in school or when needing a quick paycheck and there is always room for growing there"
good,I was there stocking the entire time. The work culture is okay; The pay is pretty good for a student. Most people secretly take unscheduled breaks.  s
good,"Pay was good, work was easy, but playing catch up cause management wanted to keep employment at bare minimum to artificially look like profits were higher only to bring more stress on the average employee, was infuriating."
good,All and all it's not a terrible company. I've worked there for a total of 3.5 years so far and I feel like my job matters. If I had to recommend Walmart as a work place I'd recommend it to those who are just starting out or need an easy job that pays the bills
good,The job isn't bad for younger people(which i am) as long as you're will to deaden your social life and work for a living especially since the management team cant seem to get it together and continues to give mandatory overtime. If you can stand for 10-12 hours a day for 4 of the 7 days a week and don't mind coming home just to wake up and do the same egregious task tomorrow and so on and so forth then walmart is the job for you
good,"While working at Walmart, we were understaffed and underpaid. Management seemed more worried about getting product to the floor than safety and appearance of the store."
good,My store is multi cultural which I love.  Good work environment.   They provide a lot of benefits I've never seen before.   Overall I like my job.   The cons are they are not good at providing training for certain positions.  It is pretty much left up to you to figure it out on your own.
good,What stands out about this company is the competive salary and potential bonus and stock compensation. The negative impact is minimal work life balance combined with a high stress atmosphere and lack of true structure.
good,ok place to work but could be better. good compensation but management needs work. union type of work environment even though we arent union. hours aren't the best
good,"Great company, feel like it's my second family. All associates are very friendly. One of the highest paying jobs out there. Management could be better."
good,"It starts with management, they don’t seem to care if people are properly trained or not, just throw you out on the floor, and you pretty much train yourself."
good,"Good work experience, pharmacist are very helpful and friendly. Opening and closing hours are decent times. This pharmacy can get really busy at times and not enough staff."
good,"Job was easy and pay was great but what set us apart was me being a college student, they seemed to think I'd prioritize Walmart over my life goal. Got fired due to points, very unfair."
good,"Its a decent place to work. Not much to say about it. If you have open availability you get can get a good amount of hours. OT always available. One of the big downsides, you HAVE to request days off way early in advance to have them approved or you have to bug them. Sometimes managers forget."
good,"the job wasnt the worst, pay was great, supervisors were great. the few complaints I had were they change your hours if you offer to stay or come in at times that weren't on your schedule and then tell you to change it manually and it takes 3 weeks to even change. also I was let go due to being unable to work and not being there long enough for medical leave. they have not rehired me after I've put in even 3 applications."
good,"I really loved working at Walmart for the first five years.  But corporate changes the past couple of years were not beneficial to employees.  Yes, they pay well...but then they cut your hours and expect more and more.  Managers listen to you, but they don’t respond.  Their hands are often tied by higher ups.  And customers often get their way even though there are policies you are expected to follow.  Again, the higher-ups tell you to follow policies and rules, then they break policy and make you bow to the customer, which makes you feel a fool.  I won’t say it’s all bad.  I really enjoy the job for the most part.  Most of the customers are decent and I have regular customers that ask for me or wait for me for service.  I’ve made many friendships with fellow workmates, as well as customers.  Benefits have changed the last couple of years, too!  And I really wish they gave you performance-based raises instead of everyone getting the same % for the most part.  I also feel that someone who has been with the company longer and is dependable and on time should be rewarded accordingly.  Seniority does not seem to make a difference at Walmart.  "
good,It isn't terrible but you are obviously just an employee. They also tend to expect you to know how to do things outside of your job description with no training whatsoever. As long as you speak up for yourself it is okay but it will really suck for more passive people.
good,No work/life balance I was salary so my life involved around work they can call you anytime at night and expect you to stay over you never leave at your scheduled time working 13 to 14 hour days is normal
good,"Walmart was a fine first job, but you will be worked and hired on your hours first and foremost. If you need money and need to sustain yourself, Walmart will be the place for you. Being a corporate business, they allow breaks, lunches, and flexibility with clocking in and absences. With all the free time in the world, the jobs their are not bad, but if you aren't looking to 30+ hour weeks, without lying or changing availability, this may not be the job for you. Other than that, the job is what you expect. Customers, managers, HR and supervises all act how you would expect."
good,They expect you to work your areas and everyone else’s area to. There is a lot of room for advancing and improving. They cross train everyone. Good benefits.
good,Be careful you trust in walmart it not all how they say it goes. A lot of lies and mistreatment  goes on. But has flexibility and do care about your family.
good,I enjoyed working there for a while but now all of the sudden it becoming very frustrating at times due to the management. Otherwise it is a nice place to work.
good,The managers only care about their bonuses and the company doesn’t care about your personal life . Their main concern is the company and what they can get out of you
good,"At Walmart you meet people all the times.  greet, help and thank  them. You have so many boss. you need to ensure customers have on the shelves merchandise and supplies they needs every single day. At Walmart , employee has a lot of different jobs and  can move between them easily. Employee has a carreer preference."
good,"My personal management was great, but the demand of the work was extremely hard on your body. There wasn't much responce when did things that put other workers in danger"
good,They don't give very good raises and don't give adjustments for minimum wage increases for people who worked there before the increase. I barely make more than people who just got hired there.
good,"Working at Walmart allowed me to meet many new people, and learn about different walks of life. Also showed me valuable skills in retail work. However accountability is an issue, rarely is everyone on the same page effort wise, resulting in some working very hard to make up for lack of effort."
good,Walmart has been a good work experience for the time being it’s taught me some things and worked around my schedule at times and would recommend to friends and other younger people around my age getting into the work force.
good,It's a fast pace work place. I loved working with my coworkers and working as a team. I loved helping customers with anything they needed. I liked running the cash register and checking out customers.
good,In the beginning when I first started to work for Walmart it was a good company to work for  the recent changes I feel like this company has filled in so many ways and not looking into family time and etc. when you have family emergencies you have to call off and you still get occurrences and leads up to termination and they lose really good employees that way.
good,Typical day was stocking and interacting with costumers making sure their needs are met. Direct supervisors were great generally. Hardest part was upper management uncommunicative to each other having multiple conflicting orders from different managers. Most enjoyable was satisfying costumers needs.
good,"Coworkers can really affect how well you do your job and whether or not you enjoy it. Having people who are working toward the same goal can be pretty exciting. I've actually found family by working with walmart, blood related and otherwise. I've built life-long friendships with people who have been there longer that I was, and they were always willing to help me grow as an associate."
good,Good fast paced job always something to do never nothing to do. Very understaffed and ask way to much of one person for the amount they pay. If your retired and need some extra cash good place to work not really a carrier building company.
good,"I liked the pay there but, my last manager wasn't fit to run a pharmacy. She would yell and lose her temper at us for no reason. I would never work for her again. She’s the reason I decided to leave Walmart."
good,I worked online grocery pickup and when I tell you there is always something to do! I loved the fact that there was never really down time. It made the day go by fast. Management at Walmart sucks. They let the title get to their heads. The pay is pretty decent for what it is but you only get maybe a 2% raise yearly. They hire you as part time but you work fulltime hours without the benefits which depending on your situation isn't ideal.
good,"Management doesn’t really appreciate you as they should. People that are qualified for positions often get looked over for the managers own agenda. You just aren’t valued as an associate no matter how hard you work, unless you’re kissing up. I loved my work family though!"
good,I had an extremly positive experience with Walmart for the most part. The saddest thing is 82% of people live under the poverty line. Excellent service and Lower prices  don't always add up to good life
good,"The hiring process is extensive, but you will be prepared for anything from a water spill to a shooting.. the head hanchos didn't do anything.. one assistant manager carried a mutual respect, but the other 2 in asst. Managers had big heads.. Coworkers were almost too diverse, it was hard to make friends."
good,"It is very fast paced and they expect a full case to be stocked in 1 minute, which is challenging for some. In a lot of cases it can be a popularity contest and in the beginning you can feel like the new kid in school."
good,"Good place to work, great pay, but the management of employees was chaos. I would still recommend working here if one needed a flexible work schedule."
good,My typical day is cleaning bathrooms and spills - doing the trash and recycling. I learned how to use compacters. Management is mainly ok. Other coworkers complain of dirty workplaces (and smelly sometimes). The hardest part of my job sometimes can be finding help for me (and when I help a customer). My most enjoyable part of the job is helping people finding all they need at the store.
good,"The beginning of my work experience at walmart started off great, but some different situations began to make me feel it became an uncomfortable working environment."
good,"Overall good pay for hard work..   Generally the management will work around your schedule, unless it's a holiday, then you are mandated to work before and after several days of or docked doubly on your merit scale."
good,"My Walmart’s managers had 0 respect for their employees. Many of the customers were very nice and understanding when something wasn’t right. If you like to meet all different kinds of people, then this job may be good for you."
good,"Empresa dá oportunidade, porém algumas conduções de chefia deixam a desejar quanto a promoção e demissão. (panelinha). Salário abaixo da média nacional."
good,"Nice place to work if you have a work ethic I enjoy working here - when I'm busy. Checking out customers, Re-shopping returns. Customer Service & self checkout"
good,This is a good place to work if you get the right manager and the people here are so nice and they've helped me so much but certain managers aren't good
good,If you are just starting out working then you should reach out to a Walmart near you. With Their fast paced environment and constant influx of people its sure to help you Perfect Customer Relations.
good,I would recommend Walmart as a second d job or first job or if you're retired and just need a little bit of extra money. It has fair pay for what the job is and everything just the work environment could be better.
good,"Pleasant fast paced working environment with annual performance reviews, benefit package, stock options and annual profit sharing are the perks. Appreciation by direct manager is regularly announced. Individual expectations vary depending upon certain work loads and personal capabilities."
good,"I’ve been working at walmart for two years. I have no benefits because I didn’t have enough full time hours when the enrollment period came around, because I switched from part time to full time. They know I’ll work when they need me to and they use that to their advantage. Breaks are hours late because they won’t train people to work over there, so we have to wait till a csm is available."
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart. Helping to assist customers was very rewarding. The job had it's challenges but overall they did not create any stressful situations. Enjoyed my time with coworkers and Management treated me fairly.
good,"No matter what department you work in, it is a very stressful environment. If you are in one that is team oriented then there is always people who get away with anything. The PTO and Sick time is very unfair, and they will punish you if you are sick too much. "
good,"It was okay, some of the assistant managers that I worked with didn't really like to do their jobs or help out in their departments, but the hourly associates were usually really nice and helpful. I enjoyed interacting with most of the customers and it paid decently. I would recommend working here to most people."
good,Wal mart will do anything to kepp you working there. Management that was been there for awhile knows what to do so follow their lead. Or not. Hopefully you'll do good
good,Managers are a joke for most part. Certain manager sleeps his way through associates and gives them special treatment. Company says they have ethical values but allows this to happen. This company has no care about anything except for production. God forbid you have an accident they make you feel guilty and treat you like a dog so you won’t actually get treated. The pay is decent but they treat you like
good,average place to work.....management was bad....left hand did not know what the right hand was doing....no communication pay was ok....if you wanted to put in for a transfer....good luck...if they are short workers....you are not going anywhere...
good,"I did not really like working at Walmart. The managers did not care about their associates, just about themselves. I did not like my job in general. Everything had to be perfect"
good,Work very well work hard do others work.  Early lay off.  Company saves money.  Seasonal and temporary work available.  Learn by doing others work.  Normal working environment these days.
good,Walmart is a big company and has many different departments you can work In and learn many different things while you are here. They give you the opportunity to advance in the company and the pay is not so bad either overall not a bad company to work for.
good,"Working Store #14 wasn't too bad. Almost always super busy on Sundays when everyone gets out of church. Most the mangers are alright, some are worthless and will make your job much harder."
good,du aux manque des personnel. Le stress est vraiment quelques chose qui nuit a l'harmonie de la place
good,"So many different directions to go within a company of this size. "
good,I enjoyed working with the customers and fellow employees at Walmart.There was ample room for advancement but sometimes the more qualified were overlooked. I felt the pay could have been better but they do offer a discount to employees which helps to understand the evaluations for pay raises.
good,You have to be ready for a fast-paced day.  No two days are the same and there is always a variety of things that are happening at one time.  You can rely on your team members to help out and get the task done.  Diversity is a big thing there and you are able to be yourself the majority of the time.
good,"Was a first job for me so it wasn't too bad at first, but after being their after a year you come to realize how awful the management is and how badly they treat you."
good,It is best not to question most things. There are rules for asset protection that do not help you as an associate but just cover the back of the corporation.
good,"If you're looking for a job that pays decent Walmart is not bad starting out at 11.00 an hour,but you get no Holiday pay.  Also a lot of the time you do not get very many hours "
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart, I feel it worked for my life at the time.  I feel that over the years the employees have suffered due to a decrease in benefits and incentives. Walmart would have better quality customer service and overall experience if the training modules were easier to get through and the employees received more benefits.,"
good,"Customer service associate, operated cash register,rung up merchandise using computer terminal and scanner. Bagged merchandise cleaned area and greeted customer"
good,"In management, Walmart pays very well, but there is a downfall in management as well. They don't ever train their employees properly, no one likes to take responsibility for their actions, no one likes to be a team player they only like to make themselves look good. Upper management talks down on everyone and always see the bad in people nothing is ever good or they are never happy with anything that you do, even when you are working very hard. The turn over rate is very bad as well."
good,Low esteem but flexible hours. Cart Pushers get payed lower then rest of store. Management only cares about job being done even if not possible regarding certain circumstances.
good,The work there was challenging and productive. I learned about custodial duties and how to improve my customer service skills. There was a management team. The hardest part of the job was working busy days when we were short on courtesy clerks. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers with carry outs.
good,"Many times I had Given them notice of a schedule change due to classes, they did not change my schedule at all. they do not fight for their e,ployees as they previously had in years."
good,"Team is great, people are great, work environment is great. Working there on a daily basis is tiring not much help from management but co workers are awesome"
good,"Buena, y fácil de responder en general agradable  confiable"
good,Associates are encouraged to bring their full selves to work each day which creates a positive environment of inclusion.  There are opportunities for everyone to learn.
good,"As a Customer Host I have had not only the privilege to service my customers, but also the ability to build a relationship with most of them thru my line of experience."
good,Walmart is a pretty good place to work as long as you don't mind being treated as part of a group rather than as an individual. They pay very well but the work is tough and not for everyone.
good,The management is only worried about taking care of friends. The store managers in the region all warn each other when corporate is in the area so no real surprise visits. Which is why the company as a whole is dis-liked.
good,"The good part is that I have a job. The bad part is the company is always changing the policy,  they are taking away benifits. Like we no longer have paid vacations or holidays. Instead we accumulate hours each week.  There is no longer a 40hr week for most associates. I have been there almost 15 years and that doesn't matter."
good,"Walmart has a “point system” and your only allowed 5 points in a matter of 6 months. You call out 1point, no call no show, 3 points. Management doesnt know how to communicate some sometimes even when you call out your still get 3 points. Also you don’t get any type of benefits until after 90 days of being employed and no PPTO till 90 days."
good,"I enjoyed most of my Walmart career, although a lot of weekends were stressful, liked meeting all sorts of different people. My supervisors were amazing and helped a lot with organization."
good,"work not to hard some managers are good pay is not great but comparable to other retailers in spring hill area, if you want to make a living get out of spring hill area"
good,"It's not the best job in the world, decent they like things done fast, cool workers, good pay for a retail job, Flexible, you get a 10% discount when you work for Wal-Mart for 90 days."
good,A mi parecer es un buen ambiente de trabajo pero un salario muy bajo
good,I enjoy being around the customers and coworkers. It has given me more experience in problem solving alone and with others. The bad experience is feeling that you dont matter to the management staff or corporate.
good,The job was okay. I had some personal issues and that’s way I’m looking for a new job. Some managers was great others lacked the skills to manage. It was a decent place
good,I check receipts to make sure people are not shop lifting. I learned to check for spills or mess around your area. The management works around their associates together as a team things get done. Hardest part about this job is being patient to an unsatisfied customer.
good,A great place to work for those willing to grow and help other while keeping with Walmart's core beliefs. You will have to keep in mind that walmart is a ever changing company that adapts to what it feels are the needs of its customers.
good,"as a cashier, the management was not the best, but in the back of walmart where you take care of returns, organizing and/or package handling is the most fun and enjoyable place to work."
good,"I was forced to resign because one customer saw my mom hand me lunch/cigarette money. I told the manager it was my mom that gave me the money. But because a customer saw it, my manager said it looked like I was receiving a tip. So I was fired by being forced to resign. I had a job interview and my manager wouldn’t let me go to it because no one could cover my shift for one hour."
good,"disponibilidad en horarios, manejar estres y tolerancia a la frustración y cambios"
good,"I've learned a lot from working here considering it was my first job. This job has given me an appreciation for retail and food jobs. I've learned my strengths in service and my weaknesses. This job has also motivated me to find a better paying, and respectful job. I think that working at Wal Mart is not bad for a first job. It teaches you to be more respectful as a customer. You also learn how to work with others in a professional environment."
good,Basic every day retail outlet  workplace. Changing from the way they started out from. Not enough employees to keep the store at the level they should be. I would recommend people to work there but not to depend on the company to stay as a reliable income source. They give associates anywhere from 0 to 28 hours for part time and up to 37 for full time. Managers work 40 plus hours per week. Schedules are available on the computer and staff ensure their hours are correct. Store is open every day except Christmas. Self check outs are available as well as cashier run registers. Store opens at 7 am and closes at 11 pm. There are associates that work overnight stocking shelves and doing cleaning.
good,This job was a great way to build customer service skills and learn how to get comfortable talking in front of a large group of people also it was a good enviorment
good,"Working  at Walmart is okay the managers don’t get you but it’s it’s worth your time you meet really good people that you have really good bonds with and sometimes the  "
good,"This company is ever changing.. not always for the best interest of the employees. The 1st 3 1/2 years at Walmart we’re awesome. Our Store manager was amazing christian man, who often told us that sometimes he is forbidden to inform us of some things and he would apologize in advance. Then he moved on and they had 3 new store managers in for trial periods. The last one they kept he is not a person I want to work for. ."
good,The culture was crazy. I would had thought they were more put together but they’re worse than other places I’ve work to be such a well known big company
good,Working in retail at a lower level position is all about survival. Don't expect too much than your minimum wage cheque at the end of the month. Great place to interact with customers and colleagues.
good,"I would come in, and shortly after we would unload the truck, once this was done we would stock the shelves. This job would've been better if the building was more organized, or if they ever closed, so that we could fix things. Morale tended to stay low within stock crew, and the lower it got the longer it took to do things. I found myself trying way too hard to help out coworkers who kept telling me to just focus on my station, even when that would've meant standing around, and doing nothing. When I finally stopped helping them their stuff was all that was left on the line, while everyone else was done, and ready to stock the shelves."
good,"This job had its ups and downs like with most jobs dealing with customer service. At the time, I did a lot of tasks well beyond the job I was hired for and was not rewarded properly when it came to any kind of advancement or pay increase for doing so. The people I worked alongside made it worth it."
good,"My tasks at Walmart was running the cash register, customer service, help customers with any questions or concerns,process payments to Walmart credit cards and or other company payment, cash checks payroll and personal, make change, count change back, assistances in questions or answer any questions the customer may have, problem solving, team work, team building,"
good,"Nice clean environment, but they do not offer overtime at all and they have a point system which causes a lot of people to get fired quickly, which is why night shift is very shorthanded"
good,For the area that I live in Walmart is the top paying company. They do have good benefits. I enjoyed the people I work with but some I did not. I hate being talked down to by management and corporate thinking they are higher then the rest and that nothing can happen to them. I do not take the I know everything and you no nothing from managers. It is a great place to work when you have a good crew to work with but when you have lazy ones and you call them out on it and management just push it aside like you are just being to harsh is when you have issues. I prefer evenings because everyone works well together. Also when another Customer Service Manager comes along you get pushed aside and thrown into all different shifts while they get consistent ones.
good,its a good place for your first job. the people you work with is great. but the management has no communication at all and is its like high school all over again with drama and roomers.
good,I had some problems with certain member of management when I was moving up as Department Manager. And HR had to get involved because they were trying to be involved with something that doesnt pertain to them at all.
good,"Everyone experience differs depending upon the person. It also differs from store to store, Management may have better communication skills and be more respectful at one location than another."
good,"I pick customer orders throughout my shift. I learned cashiering,customer service. Management very unorganized. Diverse. Helping customers fulfill needs."
good,Just a few rude customers here and there but they don’t tolerate bad behavior. Make sure to stay on task and getting back from brakes on time and no rude language allowed.
good,"Walmart is okay work. The benefits are nice and so is pay, but management could treat you better. No sick days or time for family in need. Good luck friend."
good,"Great job for 1st job. You can learn a lot with retail.  Including money handling, handling customers. Understanding the operation of a top rating retail"
good,I worked at Walmart for 13 years everything was good until I got hurt then they throw me away like Old Farm Equipment I was hurt and disappointed they did not take proper care of my injuries
good,"Working at Walmart is a great introductory job, but after several months it starts to wear off and becomes stressful. Job security isn't the greatest, nor is there a promise of advancement."
good,Great for advancement but depending on what location you work will determine how well you fit in. Some stores have favorites and can not handle change. Where other stores are great at this. You can earn alot of money if you work hard and show initiative.
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart. Things changed after the current store manager came onboard. I did however learn a great deal about myself and my ability to manager and handle marketing issues.
good,As long as you don’t mind chaos and being heavily relied on if you are capable. Usually chaotic and when you get behind it is usually blamed on the unloading team wether or not it was the teams fault or not.
good,"Empresa justa, pagamento correto, mas com trabalhadores mal educados."
good,"Was in charge of 5 of the biggest department in the store, not much help. Management had their picks of associates that was treated better than others also was to friendly with managment"
good,Overall the job isn't that hard once you get used to it. It is very physically demanding because you're moving pallets and boxes weighing 40-50 pounds at times. The management could be a lot better by simply communicating more and associates between shifts could just give the people coming in a general overview of what they didn't get to because sometimes things would be a mess and you have to figure out what is what which takes away some of your time simply to start doing your job. What I can say I did like most was my coworkers but that is the same everywhere. You're going to like certain people and dislike others but I made some friends here. What I absolutely hated was having to zone everything. You find a bunch of items in places that they don't belong and oh my god does it get annoying but that's retail for you.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work and is very inclusive of people of all ages, There is lots of room for advancement. and once you make full time the benefits are good."
good,The place was great to work at and everyone was friendly. But some managers weren't that nice. I made a lot of friends at work and there is always someone to help you if you need it.
good,Was misunderstood working there. Didn't have a good month at home and it showed. Wished I was more understood in the fact that sometimes you have a rough patch and I was having one
good,"Not very much opportunity for job growth or advancement, poor management leads to everyone doing someone else's job, poor planning leads to high stress situations, lots of overhiring and understaffing"
good,"The Cashier position is shift work,  a typical day can be 4 to 8 hours from 6:45am to 11:30pm. Breaks are guaranteed. Performance is monitored. Atmosphere is friendly. Training is provided and staff encourage best practices. Overall an ok environment for someone entering the workforce."
good,It is a good place to work only when you work with the people you make friends with the managers was no help at all and the store manager was not a good store manager you can ask anybody that worked there
good,"I've learned so much at Walmart, Customer service, how to multi task many things at once and work ethic. The hardest part of my job can be customer service but it can also be the most rewarding, when you are able to help someone no matter what there need."
good,It was ok working here it could improve and it could use better management and work culture to make it an even safer and enjoyable work environment for all its employees
good,"Steady flow of customers, associates kept busy with cleaning, spot checks, assisting on sales floor or as a cashier.  breaks and lunches where kept on time. reasonable time for breaks and lunches."
good,"Employees are the only reason you would stay"
good,There wasn't the best management on over night shift some could be a bit unprofessional at times even rude and disrespectful. Not that much hands on training. Poor communication between managers to employees. If you were looking for something with simple task this place was it.
good,"Walmart is like going back to high school. You have clicks and favorites. If you are not a favorite, get ready for long days while favorites stand and talk."
good,"they hired me seasonal with out mentioning to me,The first manager road me hard even though i was new .i worked without any appreciation it seemed bad experience all together."
good,"I worked in the Deli. Me and my co-workers got along well and I still keep in contact with a few of them. Pay was fair for the job duties, bonuses were small but at least they gave bonuses, holiday meals. I would recommend for anyone."
good,"Worked for company for over 20 years, and in my opinion it’s not as good of a company as it once was.If you Need a job and don’t mind hard work, it helps pay bills . Every store is different from the other . Spent my career at 1346 most of it was good. My issues are not with the store but company as a whole."
good,"Overall it was a good experiance working here, when i got put on night shift is when it all went down hill, needs of their employees were not met. They didnt care if there was a manager or css up in the front but we got in triuble for asking a different department manager for assistance."
good,"The managers were alright, just very unaware , and the supervisor s act like they run the whole store. They move you out of your departments alot , to departments that do not have anything to do with your primary job position. Also don't lose any family members, because they never cleared me for bereavement periodeven tho they said I was clear"
good,"it's often difficult to make rate due to ongoing vendor issues, which seems to fall on a lot of deaf ears, far too many associates are suffering because of it."
good,"Pays well for the job you do. Most of the time they will work with you to help you with your issues. They play favorites and will talk about you behind your back if you aren’t one of them. The environment can be toxic sometimes, depending on which location you are at. If you’re good at ignoring that sort of thing, you’ll be fine. Overall, it’s a good job, especially if you’re looking for experience or to advance."
good,The good is that there will always be work and hours. The Bad is that is never a job that will get finished. I think that this is summed up. And this is all that I have to say about it. You will always wonder if you will get a lunch break. In fact if the cash drawer locks you out if you have not had a lunch with in six hours.
good,"The managers were nasty, the co-workers were fan and welcoming. They are very strict. we were always busy.Always had to work harder or do more then what your job title was because of organization."
good,"The company is a decent place to work. They are also good community activist. "
good,Walmart can be a difficult job based on the member of management calling the shots for the day.  There are often times when you will find yourself doing more then necessary and no one will even notice.
good,Walmart was a good job the hours were reasonable and the pay was always fair I really had no trouble getting to work or having problems at work everybody at work was very nice and we all got along to complete the
good,"Muita pressão no dia a dia. Há muitos colegas de trabalho incríveis, mas há muito estresse todo dia."
good,"The job itself wasn’t easy but I liked it, loved helping customers but I had been getting sick recently and the job requires you to be outside pretty much 100% of the time and the weather was just not helping my health at all and I had personal reasons at home to quit"
good,"Walmart is a very business forward company. If their business is affected they will step in immediately. It's very quick paced and highly organized behind the scenes but not so much on the sales floor. They dont take their employees into account highly, I was laid off based on my arm being broke and I had only been there for about 30 days or so"
good,Its a great place to get customer experience for future jobs your looking for. They occasionally let you switch days with other associates but they are very strict about attendance.
good,All i can say is good LUCK if you're not all about walmart then you will be shunned out or made to look like you don't do anything. If you kiss butt alot this the job for you
good,Worked at entry level in 1992. Was promoted to sales associate for 6 months before being promoted again to Department  Manager of Hardware. After 1 year I was promoted again to Domestics Department Manager. In 1999 I was offered the Personnel Manager position. I remained in that position until August of 2019 when my job was eliminated
good,"walmart has good pay for the area. The people I worked with were great."
good,"Very structured, strives on consistency and routines. Inventory processes must be maintained daily in order to reduce any shrink, or loss in total inventory."
good,"Clima laboral tenso."
good,i learned how to cope with coworkers and management its stressful at times but i loved the work and some customers are great. i just see myself doing something different.
good,"It was a learning experience, my work ethic got better. At sometimes it was a bit unorganized but regardless it was a great experience and I thank them for giving me a shot"
good,"Great pay for the area, if you don't mind a lot of physical work. One of few jobs that can give you your preferable schedule. Beware of certain people who work here. Not an easy job, there's a reason it pays highly for this area, If you don't mind being on your feet and constantly lifting objects for hours"
good,Lots of great people to work with. Has a very fast paced work environment. Sometimes hard to maintain a good work life balance.  Wages comparable to other retailers.
good,"Oced my immediate manager but the store manager constantly made things difficult. A LOT of drama, but also a lot of friendships made. The OGP department was alot more fun than others I worked in, and allowed me to create lasting relationships with customers. Overall fun, but the company doesnt value employees much."
good,"Although coworkers were at hand, management was too focused on what upper staff prioritized opposed to aiding and teacher new and promising staff. Daily work primarily consisted of money handling and customer service. However, at times when staff ran low, I was spread around to different departments for physical labor, organization, and other tasks."
good,it was a good job very fast pace and keeps you on your feet getting people's orders was something new for me because i wasn't used to doing that and you had to bring it to their car and see what they didn't want
good,"A typical work day on my team is quite hectic as the team was a mixture of adults and young college students. I feel as if the problems accorded due to how everyone values their job. Overall, it was straight job."
good,"I started as temporary Christmas help ,on the sales floor. I moved to the back room after Christmas. "
good,"Stressful but manageable"
good,"In most cases, I was either forced to empty out 5 pallets in a 5 hour shift on a weekend or was expected to work when there is nothing to do at all. It really is a coin flip whether or not you're going to need to bust your back working or polish your acting skills by pretending you're doing something. In the 1 and a half years I worked there, I have had 5 different department managers. Honestly, whether or not you enjoy the job is mostly reliant on your relationship with your manager. 3 out of the 5, have made me consider quitting multiple times. However, my coworkers were great. The workplace is surrounded by other people like you, that are either working part time while at school or trying to make a living in a new country to support their family. I got along just fine with all the numerous people working there."
good,"The location I worked at was understaffed, and as a new employee, it made i hard for me to train in the current department I was in because I needed to help in other departments."
good,Walmart is a busy place.  Always something to learn and accomplish.  Never boring.  Trying to help customers can be fun.  Other times it can be challenging.
good,Working at Walmart is a somewhat fun environment but when you are the you must be ready to work and even be moved at a moment's notice. There are some mangers up there that are truly unlike but that's the same with any job all you need to do is be kind and stay relaxed with your associates because they can make your job way better or even worse it all depends on you
good,"The job itself isn't too awful, Produce and Meats sometimes has a lot of lifting 40+ Lb. boxes. It sometimes seems like management is always asking for more to get done in the same amount of time, which usually leads to other things being ignored. As long as you enjoy working with the other employees, the day goes by pretty fast. Being able to shop after work, or get Deli food on breaks is a nice plus. The worst part of the job is taking the Organic waste out to the bin that we sell to a local farmer, especially in the coldest winter times or hottest summer times."
good,Company has good values. Good opportunity for advancement. Understands that people have families and emergencies. Often the work life balance is not good
good,"Flexibility with my schedule was not an option, no set schedule goes week to week. Excellent job for a few years if you don't have a life outside of work."
good,"From the 8 months, I have put in at Walmart, the more and more I have grown burnt out and frustrated with the business. Unrealistic expectations and rude Management. Never wanting to properly staff and then yell at you when you got 3 people to run 4 demanding departments and then threaten your job. Constantly making you come in on your days off or your job will be in jeopardy."
good,"I worked here while I was a senior in High School, I started as a cashier and worked my way up to a sales associate. I enjoyed the time I worked here and if given the opportunity would want to work here again."
good,I learned to stay to my self and get the job done bur over all lots of fun safe environment safe work place it was a time i forgot my wallet in the break room two hours later went back my wallet money every thing in it how i left it moral of the story is safe work place yes indeed
good,"The things I most enjoy at work is being able to help customers with anything they need help with, whether it'd be mixing paint for them, helping them look for wind wipers for their vehicle, or even within my sporting goods department. My workplace seems to make me feel accomplished when I get to help find customers with whatever they're looking for."
good,The people I worked along side at Walmart were nice and helped loads except you had a few bad apples and management there was awful and never gave us right tools to make life easier and for us to get job done fast.
good,"I would recommend this job as a stepping stone, especially for those in college // Not the greatest managers, but that's partially due to the frequency of promotions // Some managers definitely play favorites, so some promotions are undeserved, but there are definitely a select few managers who earned their spot // Work-Life balance is fair, however a strict availability could result in fewer hours, which is to be expected // Great paternity/maternity benefits for employees who have been hired for over a year (6 weeks paternity / 10 weeks maternity)"
good,"Managers show favoritism. Managers never respect their employees, or listen to employees. Stores refuse to hire more workers, so managers can pocket more money."
good,Hard to get the job here. Tiring to work here because the floor hurts my feet and knees. 11 an hour is good for what the job is though. I just couldn’t take it for more than six months because they won’t move you to part time for six months.
good,There was this one CSM he would harassed me at work just because he knew me from school and if I didnt do everything right he would get on to me but not everyone else for not doing it. They wanted me to do everything right but not everyone else. They also expected more of me than anyone else.
good,"I have given my interview two times ,but in response its always said that we have already hired someone before my interview. That is very disappointing."
good,"The associates at Walmart enjoy their jobs and do it to the best of their abilities."
good,I didn’t really care for Walmart. because they wanted speed instead of efficiency And my thing is is when you have an employee working only one section and then throw them in another section and not help and I get fired I didn’t care for it at allIf I was to recommend this job  I would say good luck
good,My time at Walmart was a okay experience. In the end it was bad because of communication problems at my store but overall indifferent. Definitely recommend for anyone looking to lay a foundation in your resume.
good,They were kine to the fact that I needed help and that when I went into one of my seizures they'd get m as d at me for standing around which i thought was very disrespectful
good,"Easy job no matter what dept. you're in, however because it is very easy to move up at Walmart you end up with a lot of incompetence among the managers which can get frustrating. If you just mind your business and work its great opportunity, pay, and benefits."
good,It is a good job and they work with your schedule so that you can accomplish other goals in your life and I like that they found what I really wanted to do and made it to where I could move to that area.
good,"When I started as cashier I saw potential for advancement,  also enjoyed the Respect for the individual philosophy. Over the years not so much Respect for the individual and the work expectations became unrealistic."
good,I would not recommend working as a cashier at Walmart as they push their cashiers to sell the Walmart rewards MasterCard.  I do not feel comfortable with that and nor am I a bank.  If you do not get so many MasterCards you get in trouble.
good,"As a cashier, all I really had to do was run my register and keep my lane relatively organized"
good,"Pues yo trabaje en un Cedis, y comparando las actividades de un cedis a otro por ejemplo el de Culiacán o de San Martín Obispo Pues en Monterrey se hacía mucho más trabajo pero cobraba lo misma cantidad de sueldo"
good,"A cashier is a great position, but when your in a store filled with tourist, it’s hard to enjoy your position and do it to your best ability. If anyone wants to take a leave of absence for maternity or family. Make sure it’s very short. Walmart has caused great stress and frustration while on leave for losing my unborn child. It’s always call in everyday to report absence, go to the doctors. It’s hard to do that when your constantly bleeding and have contraction like cramps."
good,"Never on schedule so no work days"
good,"Work in general is easy to learn."
good,The Walmart DC is a much better place to work with good starting pay and set schedules. It is a very fast paced environment that requires a lot of physical labor. I personally did not enjoy my experiences at the Walmart Store. I would only recommend as a short term job or retirement job for benefits.
good,"Cashiering is the only postion that is not rewarding, its slow and not much for a cashier to do which makes it very boring and your left creating things to do to pass the time."
good,"I liked it at first, then when the manager got used to me, I tried to ask for a different shift change to fit my life schedule at that time and she denied me every time."
good,"Walmart has great benefits and resources for their employees. However, the pay is very low and poor work environment in the metropolitan area. Management do not work together as a team and do not help build up morale for their employees."
good,"The work itself wasn’t bad, it was just the managers and some of the other employees. I don’t let things get to me easily, but this job really did. But also, the fact they actually tell you that you get to work together, all the associates, but you don’t work with anyone. I’m okay working by myself, but if you’re told you work in a team, and you never do, is just not good."
good,Try not to have a life outside of work. Is fast Pace work. Better if you have friends to work with. Focus on learning your job first work on speed later
good,"Part time job.  Enjoyed the work and helping people.  Learned allot about how the company is run and all the different departments in the store.  Met allot of nice people.  "
good,me gusto la atención personalizada que tenia con los clientes.
good,"Long hours, great pay, expect to work excessive hours without a thank you or good job. Treat people like they are disposable. A typical workday is 12 hours, the most enjoyable time is when I am home with my family the little time I see them, Insurance has high deductibles so don't get sick. People call off constantly and company allows the practice. Protected Paid Time off when every they want a day off...."
good,At first the job was great and started off well. But I had many issue with their system. I had many issues trying to access my schedule and my PTO through their program.
good,"Foi bom o quanto durou , uma equipe muita boa, colaboradores unidos"
good,"Understand that consistency is not the Walmart way."
good,They dont pay well unless you get into management and then it becomes stressfull and all to consuming...they want more and more...its never enough. They send you to training that you dont use...but its paid for. Waste of time.
good,"management was typically apathetic to many problems and unless problems were significant or would impact the store as a whole, problems weren't taken care of in a timely manner"
good,"Walmart has had good team work. Walmart is like all obs, good days and bad days as well but I really do enjoy working here because of some of the people. Management there does need some more work but overall it has been a good experience and job."
good,"I wouldn’t work there again unless is the only place I can work on. Not really the best, too much work for that little amount of money, management is a mess, hours change a lot"
good,"The job is simple, but you won't go anywhere.  You can learn every position and bust your butt and still be at the bottom in their eyes. They play favorites and if you don't start out as one you never become one."
good,Its a an overall good place to work great flexibility but can become redundant. Better management and higher pay could go a long way in correcting current issues.
good,Overall Walmart is a good company to work for. They are flexible with scheduling and they will work around school as well as family matters. It is also good if you are still in school. However they do not give you many benefits other than store discounts.
good,"Fast paced environment need to be willing to work, need to be able to stand on your feet for long periods and be able to move around on your feet.  Have to have very good customer service skills."
good,It’s an ok work setting but the management were not very nice uplifting people and the employees were not very hard working they liked to goof off and talk more then they did working
good,"The company continues to grow,  change, and look for ways to improve itself.   They stream line processes and work loads. Everyday is a new challenge."
good,Management didn’t take up for employees they let other supervisors come in and mess with the employees as if it was they job to do that and when you address the situation they don’t have your back
good,"There are many chances for advancement. One may even switch departments. Only negative is there are some poor managers, though not all are. Often they seem to reward those who dont perform for fear of not having enough crew for business demands"
good,Learned a lot: how to handle customers and manage several employees. You get to meet a lot of nice ( and not so nice) people. It can be a fun/exciting place to work at.
good,Too many managers who are not on the same page bossing around far too few employees. Turnover here is high. Store morale is at an all time low. Nobody is happy to work there anymore.
good,"I like this company "
good,"Just bad management and they didn’t have no pity for us so I tried my best and continue working until I was done with the place, but hopefully this job or another job could be great for me"
good,The hours are long and very inconsistent with schedule. When can have an issue that they cannot handle on their own they do not get support from upper management
good,"Work is as fun as you make it. Management is spread thin. Some are good some are not. Stress has been increasing over the last year. They do train you a bit if you are going into a management position. They will send you to an academy store for training so you will learn the correct way to do your job. Not a bad place to work, just gets stressful at times"
good,It is a good first job to gain experience in the workforce. Can try out different departments to find one that you like. They are very flexible in terms of schedules so it is great for students
good,Walmart was a pritty good job but if you worked hard you got no recognition and the lazy workers were rewarded. Managers were sleeping with employees but when reported it was brushed off as hear/say. Drug deals between employees were investigated but with no consiquenses. Was made to work every holiday and was never given days off with my family. But a lot of the employees were friendly except in management. Lots of drama with the management.
good,"I  learned new skill, like the management, I am proud to work with them, They give flexibility, It though does not guarantee working hours. The annual review is in time & on time. We get increase automatically each year & we also get bonus time after time Dealing with customer is challenging job We like to see that customer goes home with satisfaction"
good,Walmart has great benefits and good pay but the managers take advantage of that knowing that people want to work because of that they think they can use that to control you at least at the one I worked at 4th Street Walmart Longview Texas is not a good one to work at the man just tried to come on to you and some of them are already doing things are not supposed to
good,My experience working at Walmart was good and bad. I was able to complete any task that was given within a timely matter. However the management team could have been better. Most managers did not treat their associates with respect as well as giving workers a chance to gain more experience.
good,"They are always severely understaffed and i’m OGP they up the orders but they don’t up how many"
good,"Culture is extremely performance driven, no real work life balance within the role. Work is hard and can be difficult at times. If you are willing to work hard and put in a lot of hours and a lot of time to develop skills then you have the chance to advance in the company"
good,It was not the worst place I have ever worked. There is room for advancement and I like the employee discount. I like managing the inventory side of the business
good,"It’s ok, but it could be a whole lot betters. I feel like people there don’t really care about the work load for others. Management seems to never be around when you need them."
good,"Walmart has amazing benefits once you qualify for them. However they always expect more work tha can be done in the 8 hours, being your usually working alone.  They often run the schedule with the bare min people. Never taking into considerstion truck loads or absences. Its all about the numbers and profit. I have known some amazing managers, but at the same time their has been horrible ones. They treat management poorly and expect them to run on little."
good,I just wanted out of my department. I had been in the deli for 11 and a half years and wanted to do something else and they wouldn’t move me out of the deli
good,"i enjoyed it until new assett protection guy took over, I did not think he was professional or did a good job at all. The other office girls did all his work for him while he spent his time on the floor flirting with female patrons."
good,"Working as a remodel associate helped me grow in teamwork and communication as our job was to have the store look perfect when the season ended. I was unimpressed with my hours and management, and decided to leave based on that."
good,"Was a good place to work, floor managers were fun to work with, but some of the head management were rude and did not treat you fairly. Good first job"
good,"Typical day included doing tasks which coincided with your job title, Management would sometimes pull you off of your tasks to go help another area of the store while your tasks fell behind and you'll get reprimanded. That was the hardest part of the job really was the constant change of managements goals."
good,"I had to be moving a lot in this position. I had two departments to take care of as well as mixing the paint, which I quite enjoyed. I had to talk to customers on the phone to help them with items they might have needed, as well as helping out in other departments if needed. The management was ok, and as far as the atmosphere in this workplace it wasn’t great but tolerable."
good,"There was a great lack of communication and respect throughout the store. Management does not take associate needs into consideration. favoritism was an issue throughout the store, and supervisors on the same level were not held to the same standards."
good,"I like the tasks I perform at Walmart, and I enjoy talking to my fellow associates. Management isn't the best though, and they seem very keen on not giving people full-time hours, even while they say they need people and yet keep hiring. Some people just don't seem very happy working there either."
good,"Regular labour work. Friendly working environment. Not a lot of personal time, by taking shifts everyday. Management are fairly friendly as well. Get to talk to a lot of customers and learn new stuff everyday. Needs to be a team player."
good,"I really love running the Lawn and Garden Dept. My customers are great and I love teaching them about products and them teaching me many tips."
good,"Typical day would consist of coming in and following up with associates. Looking at notes for the day. Taking care of cash office before lumis came. Answer customer complaints and take phone calls for management. Backup cashier if needed. 4x4 your areas once a day. Help get rid of freight left from overnights. Make sure store gets zoned and customer service. Work 12 hr day with no lunch or breaks."
good,Walmart is a good company to grow and promote within. There are constant changes and happening and work always needing to be done but it has a friendly environment and a good customer base
good,"Once you work full time at walmart it becomes the worst job ever. I cannot remember the last time I was told good job, or anyone i work with. I do not recommend walmart to anyone who cares about the job they do. If you like slacking walmart is great"
good,Walmart was a good place for me when I was younger. They provide an opportunity to everyone it’s what you make of it. If I could do it over again I would have remained employed with them because they tried to give me opportunities to grow and advance
good,Somewhat flexible schedule. Difficult to get full time hours. Definitely a lot of favoritism. Male dominated company. This is a company to work for if standards and work ethic don't matter
good,Walmart you teach your self everything . If you are not ready to be competitive .Highly recommend another job. You do more then one role . I learn alot .
good,"Hours may vary often, can be rough for family life, Very Challenging job, good training, opportunities for advancement vary, and are rare, Pay is very poor for hourly store associates."
good,"It was pretty chill. Started in Frozen/Dairy, moved to Truck Unloader, and finished at Produce. I had great Department Managers, and Shift Managers, which was lucky. All in all, I'd reccomend working there to other people, and I have in the past."
good,I worked at Walmart for over a year and it was really nice working there. I was going to high school and it was a perfect after school job. They allowed me to work around my after school activities as well. The only issue i had problems with was once I graduated the cycle had a downfall.
good,They always talked about helping the employees but when it came down to getting help they helped no one . I was off of the schedule for a week and I tried to talk to someone for days and weeks and they did nothing
good,My department manager in particular has been very rude and unprofessional. She has belittled my coworkers and myself. She has also blamed my fellow coworkers and myself for things that only she can do as a department manager.
good,I was an overnight receiver and unloaded trucks.  I was promoted to support manager for a few years.  I went to day side to work in the cash office until the manager said that we were going to 1 associate in the cash office.  I went to Electronics to sell cell phones.  I knew nothing about them.  I then went to Lawn and Garden to help with plants and freight.  After a while I was fired.
good,Its not that bad to work there. Its a job and its good to start to get up on you feet. The people are good and fun to work with. Good to work but i think the need to listen to there workers. And back them up. Depending on the situation or problem.
good,"Walmart is a decent place for high schoolers, but not seniors already in the work force. Walmart doesn’t have opportunity. They don’t give enough leniency for call our days though. My friend has no place to live currently and is taking care of her mother in the hospital. She is their only source of income and she had to call out multiple days and she got fired. I do not respect the policy like that at Walmart. It was very unfair to her for her situation. I "
good,"Definitely a good place to start but not to end. I worked many different roles within the company and never felt that I was paid properly, and was not valued at Walmart."
good,This company has changed depending on where you work how good your experience is .  Management has better experience than the actual employees. We don’t always get praised for a job well done
good,"While everyone does people the shame on Walmart, there are good perks to working for the company. It does help with experience and the pay is not so bad. I would say that its downfall is the managers that do not listen to the employees."
good,If your looking fof a place with great benefits Walmart is definitely the place but to be kept at arms length. Do your job then leave no real help from management
good,"Depending on what department you’re working at, it can be really easy, or it can be physically demanding. My manager is very unrealistic with his demands and doesn’t even help us when we’re doing the truck, he just goes on his phone the entire time. I wouldn’t mind working here if we had a better manager and higher pay."
good,"Its okay to get a paycheque, management needs alot of help, to many things going in too many directions makes it difficult for the regular employee with no accountability from above"
good,The day to day work at Walmart consists of helping customers locate items and also sale items to customers as needed. The job I do also consists of stocking shelves.
good,Lo difícil de ahí es que cuando los jefes de área te tratan mal los subgerentes no hacen nada para ayudarte a quedarte y las personas de recursos humanos no son personas agradables
good,Walmart was an okay working environment but some of the management back when I worked there was a little off. There is not much I can say at this time because it has been a while since I last worked there and now there is a lot of new management that seems pretty awesome.
good,"Management wasn’t the greatest,they didn’t tell me what I needed to get done, and got mad when I didn’t do what they did not tell me what to do........"
good,I like my job but the management is poor they don’t want to help ppl get farther in life I want to move up and I need help knowing about a lot of things I do anything they ask and I still get no congrats or any raise I been with Walmart for 2 in a half years haven’t seen a raise yet
good,"Working at Walmart was always fast paced but I was always given breaks on time, always communicated with by my superiors and given respect. "
good,"the job is very relaxed and friendly people and staff, its very fast paced and the hours is very good. the staff treats me very fair and I enjoy working here."
good,"Working at the Walmart on arthur street is honestly fulfilling for the most part. Fellow staff are friendly and Managers usually try to help if you have an issue. "
good,"Management lacks respect. Hardest thing is being held responsible for things you no control over of. The most enjoyable part is going to work with the same team, making friends."
good,Walmart is alright but the lack of management was terrible. They would hire new people and wouldn't train them. and the managment would always talk down on you.
good,"I liked this job because of the employees and how kind they were, management would either be prepared 1 day or in total chaos another. Most of the day it would be very busy"
good,In this business you have to learn to have a back bone and not take things to heart. The management to do not teach and train. This is a learn as you go type of job.
good,Work at walmart was awesome but the management was horrible tell you one thing then change their minds.never seemed like you were apreciated at all.Was the lowest paid associates in the store with the most responsibly.
good,I left the company because I wanted to search for better opportunities. It was a great company to work for I’m not sure if I would work for the company again
good,Lack of communication. False Hope. There are not enough employees to get done what needs to be done. I prefer quality to some of the junk walmart buys from overseas.
good,The benefits are decent . There is no career growth or opportunity because it’s not based upon worth ethic nor knowledge  it’s based upon who you know . Certain Walmart policies are strict for situations out of your control .
good,"Walmart is great on paper but doesn’t translate at at store level. Pay is great, good benefits but the management team at my store is a mess. & they do not care about their associates like they claim, they will fire anybody for any reason."
good,"Walmart's pay is the worst.  You receive health coverage after 90 days but you pay your share.  After a year you are eligible for 401k-no matching. Mid-twenties = advancement. Perfect for molding. Excellent moral/team building efforts. Employee BBQ's, donut Fridays, holiday food and fun, etc....mesa"
good,"Stop worrying about yourselves, you have associates that want to talk to you but are scarier to because you are never available or not paying attention  you only worry about your own image when it’s not the associates fault 99.99% of the time."
good,"Empresa com forte cultura, extremamente voltada para o cliente e com rígida política de compliance."
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you’re in desperate need of money it is laid back and can be fairly busy as well. But be ready to work a lot because at times it will feel like you have no days off.  They offer many benefits tho so that’s a good thing
good,Overall working at Walmart is alright it’s nice being part of a team but it also has some downsides like shortage of hours especially if your a part-time employee.
good,"A typical day at work would be showing up as scheduled, seeing if you're going to be put at the register or in self-checkout to replace another associate for their break/lunch or go home. "
good,"I was basically a seasonal worker. Christmas time was extremely stressful since this was my first job, and the management did not understand how to help me manage the job and school."
good,"Haven't worked here for at least 5 years, when working here, the job was pretty laid back and easy. Managers will be managers. Compensation was okay, nothing to raise a family on"
good,I've had ups and downs with my enjoyment and feeling of purpose within this company and that mostly comes from whether there's good management or not. Also you will work most major holidays besides Christmas which is the only day off. Don't expect much time with your family.
good,Wal Mart is a good place to work if you have good managers. If you do not have good managers Wal Mart is a difficult place to work. High expectations sometimes too high lead to you working way to hard for the wage you are getting paid.
good,"un día normal de trabajo es estresante por que por lo general no hay suficiente personal para atender la demanda de clientes, aprendes a lidiar con situaciones difíciles también adquieres aptitudes para mejorar el servicio que le proporcionas a los clientes de la gerencia general no puedo decir mucho ya que no es muy comunicativo con el personal y me parece deficiente lo mas difícil del trabajo es controlar ciertos momentos de estrés o situaciones demandantes de calma mi trabajo me gusta por que requiere brindar una buen servicio a diversidad de personas"
good,Wal-Mart has been a good place to learn and grow. I have learned a lot starting from an associate all the way up to management. I have learned a lot about customer service and merchandising.
good,Walmart is a great company to work for if you are also attending some sort of school. Miscommunication between managers is one of the biggest issues that Walmart employees will face.
good,"Walmart is a job that pays well, but doesn't offer equal benefits for the amount of profit they make. I've been their for 13 years and my pay check and days off are less every year."
good,"The bureaucracy that is Wal-Mart has stifled a lot of the progress I saw what my store could do. Market-wide freezing of hiring people left our store without a lot of help for months in departments that needed it."
good,Unloading trucks and then sorting items into shelves then workers would take a break and then we unloaded all the groceries and then dinner break time. Then finished the night doing the pet section and helping customers find items.
good,It was a fast paced place to work..I would work there again.i enjoyed working there. Training was good and people were friendly and helpful. They cross trained you to also be cashier.
good,The hardest part of the job was lack of assistance. The most enjoyable part was the interaction with the customers. Workplace culture was horrible because there was no team play
good,"Opportunity to grow is there, but only through promotions.  No fully displayed teaching method of development regarding actually knowing your product hands on to better know how to sale the right merchandise to customers."
good,"I loved working at Walmart because of the people, that is what I enjoyed the most. What I didn't like was the time we worked to tell because I would never have time for my social life."
good,Great place to work. Love the relationships i built in and outside facility. Great company to grow. Started off as an assistant manager . Able to do several different jobs with companky
good,Walmart office set schedule for it's a fun environment to work at you meet some nice people the employer some of them you have a problem with for most part stay to yourself and do your job you good to go
good,"I would say Walmart distribution center 7015 was a decent place to work in the sense of it paid well. It was pretty easy work, but you had to do it in 110+ heat and if you didn't hit production for ANY reason you got written up. They are very write-up happy, and Walmart has a policy of ""employees are always at fault"" Walmart can't do wrong."
good,It was an ok work experience. The people are nice and also they are hard workers. They need more rules and management needs to do a lot better. But overall it was ok
good,"The job is easy but management makes it harder than it should be, everything is timed like any other job but this job makes it feel like your being pushed mentally to your limit, and it should not be like that in such a such a environment."
good,"Job was great on day to day bases, dealing with other associates that didn't do their job was a issue. Management did their best to address problems but seem to have restraints on what they could actually do."
good,It’s ok job if you got kids or when you good shop you get discounts on everything in the time god fast in the people you work with are good if your no how to work together
good,"Fun place to work. But really stressful, Less Associates but more work. I will not say fair salary. Vacation and break time is good. Flexible work hours for part timers."
good,"This was a great place to start off coming into the work industry, I feel like I've grown and learned so many things. Retail is not easy but it's a great learning experience."
good,But the managers at this particular location are truly some of the worst managers to ever grave any retail setting. I was taught everything I knew by a manager who switched to overnights. In comes the new assistant manager and suddenly EVERYTHING I was doing was wrong. I think it’s because she didn’t like me and wanted to let me go for awhile so she gave me some petty write-up and coaching. My other co workers and support managers were awesome
good,it was an okay job for a college student they just wanted you to work as many hours as you could and it didnt always work with my classes. they were nice people and would try to help you out but it just wasnt the job for me
good,Working as a Walmart cart pusher was a job you need to be ok with all weather situations. Be polite and and helpful. Be aware of your surroundings and be on top of getting carts out of parking lots.
good,This company can make or break you. Rules are always changing which is expected but more rapidly than they should (seemed like every few months). The work wasn’t hard but could be challenging depending on coworkers showing up for work. Management was a joke. I had a few great managers but most let the power of being a manger go to their head. Benefits were good but only if you were full time.
good,Is okay depending on management and some of the people are friendly some aren't.  When I first started working there it was good until you settle in they will run you away
good,"Enjoyed working there. Had to relocate  with husband , due to his medical condition. Co-workers  were nice and very friendly . Management was as good as Walmart allows ."
good,"It wasn't a bad job, just stressful. As a CAP2 worker we had to get everything off the truck and sorted in a amount of time that was not easy with the fact people kept leaving and we'd get new hires. We had a manager but also had to do whatever any other manger said. It was just a very stressful and irritating job."
good,"El día a día puede ser demasiado desgastante por el nivel de responsabilidad que conlleva, no existe equilibrio de vida personal y laboral. El ambiente en general es relajado entre colaboradores"
good,It was an okay job. I believe everything about the job is pathetic but it got me by. Managers were okay. Like I said it wasn't a terrible job but the rules are way to strict.
good,"WAlmart, is a big store with a lot of associates, where they have to be multitask and bring an excellent customer service. Most of the time associates have to much to do and not enough time to finalize the assignments, because they have to cover 2 or 3 departments."
good,over all it was a good place to work i feel that managment should be reviewed and there should be pay raises to keep workers working and to make them more exited to come to work
good,"Used to be a great place to work. They take away your bonus if you get sick.."
good,"I worked at the Walmart in LP, (cap 2)let me say this. At FIRST it was nice. Being the new guy they don’t apply much pressure on you, however if you’re one of those guys who work really hard and get the job done, they will take advantage of you and make you do much more than anybody else. Management there is TERRIBLE. Managers consistently on there phone. Always talking not knowing what’s going on, FaceTiming eachother. The only thing that made me keep going was the supportive supervisors I had."
good,in the 14 years i worked for walmart i have to learn to expect change i learned how to do price change and how to cap bins i also learned how to unload trucks and alos work with customerd
good,"My work experience is that Walmart can uplift you at times with free dinners at Thanksgiving and free lunches every quarter period. I worked"
good,I learned how to lead large teams through change. The company is always rolling out new process in store on large and small formats. The culture in store is extremely hesitant to embrace any changes.
good,"Management rarely speaks to the associates directly."
good,I enjoy working for Walmart but I feel as though I will not get the opportunity to progress in the company.i want to do as much as I can because I’m hard working and willing to learn anything that comes my way.
good,"Really great place to start working but the management is unorganized and not really cooperative with the employees, lack of respect and also unfair treatment."
good,I was expected to complete an overwhelming amount of work on a regular basis. 9 hour shifts with 1 hour lunches didn't help my life/work balance. Management was unforgiving for mistakes on the job as well. That being said you could get away with a lot before getting written action.
good,Management always kept me understaffed because a couple of times when we exceeded our work and then they would never fill my staffing problems. We were able to finally meet company standards
good,I enjoyed this opportunity working at a fast pace and getting to know the customers.. I was able to learn how to stack merchandise.. I also enjoyed training my coworkers on things that were new to them..
good,Working for Walmart is great if you have ample time to give to Store problems. You were talking about work life balance that you do not have thought that’s what you seek look elsewhere.  Great compensation
good,"If a job is needed Walmart will hire you, after a while u get burnt out (my store was understaffed) the hours I worked (1pm-10pm) were not great but the other option was 4am-1pm"
good,"Walmart is a good store to work at with great opportunities but management could do better. Management don't know how to talk to people with respect. I did love my job, I left every morning like I accomplished something."
good,"Work wasnt bad except you have these people who kiss up so they dont have to do anything and managers who will try to lean on those who work to compensate. Rumors, who's sleeping with who, jealousy, etc. It was like going back to high school again. Mentally draining and this is just your co-workers....the customers will provide their own set of antics. If you like soap operas and watch a lot of reality tv for drama, Walmart is the place for you!"
good,"I absolutely loved being an associate at walmart. The pay was good. The atmosphere, while I worked there was tense. I didn't really receive benefits. You have to be full-time to reap benefits. There's PTO but it takes a while to gain those. Three of My managers weren't ideal.  Although, all above, I would recommend employment with Wal-Mart."
good,"Always something to do, but it wont always be the job you were hired for, sometimes they will have you bringing in carts even if you are a cashier and then another manager will come by and ask you why your pulling carts instead of doing your job. The managers can never agree with each other."
good,I was working 8 to 10 hour shifts I was doing everything they asked me to do only to be turned down for the Position I had applied for which was a support manager
good,"My managers were knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their job and about any other jobs that needed to be done at Walmart. The work place was caring and professional, also make you feel appreciated. The hardest part of my job was dealing with aggressive customers coming into Walmart every so often. The most enjoyable part was making people happy, by either finding what they were looking for or helping them carryout a purchase to their vehicle."
good,"The amount of work you do, you are not correctly accommodated. You work way harder then you get paid to do. There a lot of confusion within management  which cause more confusion with the associates."
good,"Like every job, it has it's good times and bad times. For the most part, management will leave you alone, other times you can be targeted by them. If you're a good worker, you'll get more work to do, with the same amount of people. I have loved this job, and hated this job, and it's got me started in the work force."
good,Hardest part of the job was. Not getting enough hours. And have a manager hollering at you all the time. Because of first shift mistakes. So much he say she say.
good,"When I worked at Walmart in Nebraska it was great, I got to work a full 40 hours a week, better pay,  I made a lot of friends.  When i moved to Arkansas and worked at the Walmart in Ash Flat, they wouldn't give me full time, the pay was way worse and some times work was stressful, nothing at all like Seward Nebraska"
good,"kinda hard to perform the task that is given when you have to stop every 5 minutes to answer phones, check in customers, and run a register while a project goes to the way side making the other associates pick up the slack"
good,Walmart doesn't mix too well with you're personal life but you get good hours and good benefits. Certain departments are more complicated then others but overall it is a good job.
good,They do not back you up when it comes to customers half the time and are reluctant to move you up into another position. I would not recommend working here unless you have a friend in management.
good,Pues puedo decir k la empresa es bueno lo malo es kien la dirige
good,"The title says it all. You can make a career and advance. The pay and benefits are great. The time off is generous, but it will come at a cost. Family and work/life balance is a constant struggle, but if you’re willing to do the struggle then it’s a great job."
good,"Management can sometimes be very demanding but usually because of their work load, sometimes. I say to make it easy on you just do your job and do as they ask......"
good,I went through alot of managers at Walmart.  The good one came with goals and solutions to problems.  The bad ones slowed down productivity and killed morale.
good,It's different for different departments. Some associates like the flexible hours. Some departments are more physically demanding. The cashier hours are flexible and it's a 24 hour store
good,This job has great benefits but i would never say stay at this job unless you are in a position to deal with customer abuse 24/7. Department managers are normally overworked and pulled to other areas and the store manager i had was unresponsive and unhelpful to any issue i had. Most policies were ignored for the sake of pleasing the customer even when they are in the wrong.
good,"I loved the people I worked along side at all levels I've worked at Walmart. I learned a lot about people, myself, and life in general. However I believe Walmart has an issue with management above store level. They seem to be out of touch with the reality of people needing to maintain a work life balance. Walmart does a great job of ""teaching"" management to take peoples personal lives into account, however it is not implemented in practice. The needs of the store/company often trump personal needs. Creating an environment where you're overworked, exhausted and losing yourself. This is MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. I have no issues with the company as a whole, it's a good company to work for honestly. I just think they have some kinks in the hose of their management and it's hurting the stores and overworking their field management."
good,"Walmart is a very competitive company to get into. I started at the CC to get my foot in the door so I can eventually move into the department that best suites me and my degree. This, I was told would be easy. I find it is harder than I thought as anyone I would reach out to to networks didn't seem to want to take the time to speak with me."
good,"Walmart has grown to an extremely large corporation looking to streamline production. As a result many changes are being implemented which eliminate positions within each store. As a result job security has become a thing of the past, and even veteran associates like myself need to worry about their positions. Other than that Walmart has been good to me for 20 years. It is the .people that make up the company. Over the years I have worked for some great people, and I have worked under some less pleasant people"
good,"Everything was great with the company besides the very outdated/highly incompetent computer systems (a computer system accidently fired me), and management's inability to use the computer systems (they could have investigated the systems). "
good,"Walmart is an ok place to work. Very hard to advance. Fast paced, high energy enviroment. You must show up every shift that you're scheduled for. That doesn't guarantee that you'll get a promotion"
good,"This was a temporary position from the get-go. I advanced quickly and made decent money. It was stressful and fast-paced, but not too many complaints."
good,"I loved my job as a cashier. Everyone got along and most customers weren’t tremendously awful. My only complaint was some management styles. Good hours, so good they worked some of us half to death. Don’t really go by availability sometimes. Lots of changes happen all of a sudden."
good,Working at Walmart was fine but very stressful. As a college kid there was a lot outside of work I wanted to do but couldn’t. Working nights and holidays made me extremely lonely.
good,Wal Mart was a nice place to work at.  The employees got along very well.  I really enjoyed working for that company. Management was very considerate and concerned about its employees.
good,"As long as you stay focus and cater to the customer needs everything should fall right in place, walmart can be hectic sometimes but thats how you learn to handle certain situations"
good,I make OK money but the management team struggles to communicate amongst themselves and to associates. Managment also bickers over employees (what area they are going to work in) and will often ignore major problems in one area to staff certain other ones to keep the CFF(clean fast friendly) score up which mainly focuses on online complaints.
good,Must be able to stand for 8+ hours a day.  Be able to work with a variety of customers.  Keep yourself busy during slow times.  Be willing to help out your team.  Have a positive attitude at all times.
good,Good job fast paced environment should be a quick learner big store should be familiar with it people with ask where things are and it is better if you know where they are
good,"Good pay, terrible job. "
good,Walmart over all was an ok job some of the managers where unprofessional But I liked it I was also in high school at the time as well was my senior year
good,"Walmart's success is based on the talented associates that are willing to serve the customer, respect each other and continue to strive for excellence."
good,"Walmart is great place for a manager to learn and to develope skills, such as:  managing finances, controlling inventory, planning, and managing poeple.  Unfortunately, store level management tend to be treated as dispensable resources, and work life balance is almost non-existent for a Walmart manager."
good,"I liked working for Walmart when I worked the service desk and a cashier. I did not like working on the CAP team. I feel as though the Manager and Asst. Manager wanted an impossible task to be completed with the limited of employee and the time frame they wanted it done, and the pay is not enough the hours are also way to long."
good,"Busy, Customer driven, process driven.  Need to be able to adapt quickly and handle change effectively.  Work life balance is difficult during holiday seasons or inventory."
good,"I loved my job when I started working here, I had lots of promotion opportunities and job security. However, Walmart promotes culture but the people are so ingrained that if you’re not a tight part of a group, you’re probably gonna get singled out and gossiped about and the people who are buddy buddy with the managers will always get away with it without consequence"
good,Co - workers were for the most part good. But the managers could be rude and create a hostile and unfriendly work environment. They would have you doing work that was not in your job decription and they would not be nice about it.
good,"Good place to work. Friendly co-workers and some great customers. Everyday is a bit different and you don't know what to expect, which makes life interesting."
good,"i used to have a good long day at work got every thing done and was ready to go home and rest lol."
good,"If you like working hard, and then getting written up for underperforming in a department you have never worked in before, this is the place for you.  Hectic at times, managers who are concerned only with meeting ""target times""...I could go on but I won't.  Overall, not a bad place to work...but they never fail to mention you are replaceable at the drop of a hat."
good,"Walmart is a great opportunity for a highschool or college student to pursue, they are extremely flexible with scheduling and will work around your obligations. However, your experiences with management will vary by store and will rotate regularly (annual basis). Finding a good supervisor is a breath of fresh air."
good,"it was fun In a way for some most even I had troubles with some management. hours were good until they layoff people because of the seasons, they would get on you about if you were 2 points on sick days. but friendly co-workers."
good,Hated it.  People are rude and selfish and self serving.  Pay is not good enough for the job you are doing.  Retired as soon as I could.  Lack of organization and empathy
good,Awful team members and customers. This company has no benefits at all except for junk health insurance and 401k. No holiday pay vacation pay!! I would not recommend this place.
good,The management team shows favoritism and it’s not fair for ppl who trying to advance in the company and they don’t appreciate their associates Walmart constantly changes things in the store so that the corporate people can have more money and you  work harder for less money
good,"I enjoyed the people I met and worked with. I do miss them. However, I wasn't a big fan of management there. There were some good ones, which I did love working with. Others, not so much."
good,I personally did not like working there. To many people demanding and telling you what to do and they think there big shots... There not but that job gave them a little power and it went to their head
good,I have been working for the company over 10 years and there are lots of changes some good some sketchy but overall the company has inspired me to pursue my education and see what other opportunities are available.
good,I worked third shift for 6 months. I loved working along side my co-workers and made great friends. I highly suggest avoiding Cap 2 (second shift). A good place to work retail.
good,For the first couple days the job went OK as usual. But after i started they complained because I stocked the shelves wrong and I tried telling them its because I wasn't trained to stock the shelves. They only trained me in the back and showed me how they did that unloading.
good,"I worked for walmart for 5 years, they have great opportunities, but not in a small town. It changes all the time. It's a fast environment, if you're looking for something that can be different every day then this is your spot."
good,"While I was on the job, I was able to really grow in connections with people that I worked with. It made the job a lot easier to go to everyday when you had people there that you enjoyed seeing everyday."
good,"The people are nice, the managers can be nice. There is constantly new managers, never a consistent team. There are a lot of other workers that get away with a lot of things, a lot of favoritism. You could be a hard worker and still be treated unfairly. Those that do not work as hard as other people get away with things. Overall it is an ok place to work at."
good,"Learned the gun scanner inventory and modulars, some good skills there.  Management was inconsistant as there was no Fashion manager for a while.  Staff was fun and friendly.  I enjoyed keeping busy.  Not possible to live off minimum wage PT, and hours were all over the place."
good,Good company to work for if you’re willing to travel most of the time. Perfect for a single person who doesn’t plan on having a family anytime soon. I made money but spent most of my time on the road.
good,Management is an important role that alot of people use it to have the higher power. If people can only see that we're all humans and that a job title doesn't make you think it's okay to belittle people.
good,It was a very different experience. At times a bit hard but coworkers somehow made it seemed comfortable and easy. I needed to take care of my daughter so I stayed. But it was a decent.
good,The other people you work with are on the same level as you so the environment is not terrible in that way. You will be guaranteed the hours you are scheduled but will have to work hard even when slow. You will also be expected to work outside of your hired position because its in one of the papers you sign upon being hired. One thing to know is you are just another number for this company.
good,Overall my experience with the Walmart store I worked at was great. The company itself is not the best company to work for. They do not hold all employees to the same standards and they treat management poorly.
good,Walmart is a okay place to work sometimes it's very stressful sometimes it's not sometimes it's fun some of the managers are okay sum bare not whenever someone work there no not in the department that I work in which is now Deli
good,Hard work but it paid well. Safety was important and always on the forefront of everyone's minds. It was a hot environment but it was doable. Over the years more benefits and policies changed resulting in harder work and fewer benefits.
good,"Hardest part of the job was standing for multiple hours on concrete floor with out the ability to move freely away from cashier station."
good,Not very people oriented. Management unexperienced or didnt care.  Pay good for duties you perform.  A lot of unhappy people stuck in their job.  You get docked for not coming to work even if you are litterly stuck in the snow trying to get there.
good,Rules change daily. They treat you like robots. Certain people get away with stuff so there is definitely favoritism. Seniority means nothing. Used to love working there
good,"I've worked at Walmart for four years and each year they've taken away something!"
good,"My typical day at work, involves working freight, assisting customers, organizing the department, and many other small tasks that my managers might require of me. I usually end up getting pulled to other departments due to lack of employee's, but I've been there long enough the job is easy for me to handle and deal with. Its easy to get stressed out, which is why you just do what you can, and most management will respect that."
good,"I really enjoyed working with others at Wal-Mart, however I did not enjoy the managers or corporate. I was passed over for promotion a couple times, while the promotion was given to another employee with far less experience than me. I also felt as though some of the managers were bullies. "
good,"The management was unorganized, they aren’t at all flexible with your hours. I genuinely hated working for Walmart, and I’ve never said that about any job in my entire life."
good,"Smart & Final expects you to be perfect in the job you do as cashier. They have so many cameras they can tell when you burp. They give you "
good,"All the mangers do is time your cart and you have to complete that cart in a certain matter of time. Some of the mangers are really chill and listen to your ideas others are a** and don't care, they just want the work done. The environment is very fast-past"
good,This job was challenging because of all the items people put in their basket and it would be so much stuff. That it can take a minute to ring it up . But you have to be fast and have patience. I learned that.
good,They have lost their culture for the most part.  I'm hoping they can find a way to recapture it soon. The hardest part about working for Walmart is the being held responsible for things you have no control of.
good,"Wasn’t that bad but the management was very in organized "
good,Work/Life balance is virtually non-existent depending on your store manager. The position overall is very enjoyable and can be very exciting at times. The company overall pays salaried managers very well and the benefits are average. Overall it is a great place to start in retail.
good,I feel that there is to much pressure to get your work done.because the work force is not large enough.you are expected to get the work done with only one member where as about a year ago we had more help in a lot of departments.when I started 4 years ago I enjoyed my work.now I don't look forward to going to work.
good,I loved every position I held as an associate. Once promoted to salary management everything changed. Schedules constantly change with out notice. No work life balance. Must be part of the cliche in order to advance. Dog eat dog!!
good,Company benefits were the best in the industry.Work life balance was none existent. Enjoyed meeting others and working in an inclusive/ diverse workforce.
good,The management for my department wasn't very hands on you would see certain employees walking around the store doing nothing when they were assigned a task along with other employees taking a 45 min break when your supposed to only take a 15 min otherwise the job wasn't really that bad just frustrating seeing employees do nothing while your working and not getting reprimanded
good,"I feel that Walmart needs to go back a review Sam Waltons  ideals because business is not only about making a profit it's about serving the customer while listening to your employees who serve your business, because if you have satisfied employees you end up with employees who are more willing to serve your business by serving the customer."
good,"Just wasn't for me, customers are often rude and treat you like a joke. Very fast paced. We fot a new manager and she was often rude. Chasing rude teenagers around the store on a friday night is not my idea of a good time."
good,"Enjoyed assisting and mingling with customers.  Often escorted customers to their desired section of the store.  When necessary asked customer "" Is there anything I can help you with?"" .  Received positive feedback from customers.  Helped those with heavy bags to their automobiles as necessary.  "
good,I worked in two separate departments at walmart. I first worked in produce and left the department within about 3 months because I was getting scheduled little to no hours. I then moved to a cashier and when school started the same thing happened.
good,como empresa si..lo directores no..te ayudan mucho
good,Out of all the jobs I have had this one was the best. The communication between departments and management could have been better but over all a great place to work and advance.
good,"Was stressful at time, the work environment was okay and the coworkers were fine. The scheduling was sometimes ridiculous and working weekends was MANDATORY."
good,I liked working at Walmart! I advanced within the company. I got promoted twice within a years time. The only down side was the different work schedule everyday. We had no set schedule.
good,The older  management team turned out to be the worst. New energy came in and management started to develop. The older members of management always played favorites and never tried to get to know new employees.
good,very fast paced and alot of pressure to get things done. not enough employees to get everything done like they want. not enough communication between management and employees. Nightshift is left out alot.
good,Was a pretty good job until we got a different store manager he immediately started changing everything then decided to do away with our overnights so I have to take a 50 cent pay cut or self termination
good,I did enjoy the inter action with customers the days I worked. I learned how to conduct myself in a timely manner.Management was very helpful at the time I was working. The hardest part of the job was not receiving my breaks. The most enjoyable part of the job was training for other positions.
good,They will pay you very well but you will work more than 40 hours a week depending on what department/ area you're put in. They will write you up for every little thing they can. They will change the company rules and policies without saying anything to their associates.
good,Extremely business. Work closely with a team. Competitive pay. Benefits. Medical insurance. Life insurance. Dental and vision insurance. 401k. Paid time off.
good,"I transferred from flow thinking orderfilling was better, boy was I wrong, first you have to pick 200 boxes per hour which doesnt seem like a lot but when your riding on a lift and have to go from one side of the warehouse to the other to the pick location where you get your boxes, management doesn't compensate for the traveling time to your destination, and on top of that the two twenty minutes breaks count against your 200 box n hour quota."
good,"Work here for a summer, didn't really enjoy the culture of just clocking in and out. Everything was based on metrics of standard efficiency. You had to do X by Y or you were behind."
good,"My department (OGP) was assuredly one of the faster-paced environments in the store. Competition between employees was encouraged but never given more importance than morale. It could be tough during busy days, but never unbearable."
good,No se me acoboda el turno de noche por hijos y el gerente tenia un pesimo trato hacia el personal
good,I have no comments at this time to discuss about Walmart. Been there a long time and seen lots of changes. Some changes good and some have not been so good.
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart. But my manger couldn't work with my schedule so I was forced to let it go unfortunately. I would love to go back if they would rehire me.
good,"Not my favorite place to work but you definitely get scheduled a lot and it pays well. I just have problems with balancing my hours with school and after school activities, but I can see other people liking working there. If you're a busy person, I wouldn't recommend it."
good,"Management were all over the place. They didn't believe in work smarter not harder. Be prepared to work on the same project "
good,Started off as an ok place to work but with change in management and policies they require you to give up your life and call and text you at any given time for you to come in on your days off. Will change your schedule at the last minute which is up to 24hrs in advance.Been in a management position for almost four years it’s gotten worse instead of better seen a lot of turnover which makes your job a lot harder to complete. Upper management show no appreciation of your time and efforts
good,"Always plenty of tasks to perform, so the day goes by very fast. Too many assistant managers, and there is always a bad apple in the bunch. Open door policy not taken seriously."
good,"For the first year that I was working for the fresh department of the Northgate Walmart and it was a fun and enjoyable environment to work at. A lot of people to go around helping each other and when someone calls in there is someone there to cover for it. But after the new management took over there was now only one person per department so when someone calls in then of the the 3-4 people needs to cover 2 departments, not only that you get the blame for why the department looks bad because you didn't focus on one department at a time before working 2-3 other departments."
good,Walmart provides a work environment that is geared towards getting things done. With all the departments it feels like multiple stores within one building. The company provides excellent care for the employees.
good,"Walmart is good to work for and has many benefits that get better the more hours you work. Most employees and managers are good to work with."
good,It's alright. There have been some changes over the last few years that have put more of a strain on the associates and the area managers. They are trying to make changes for the better but there are some growing pains in the meantime.
good,"A typical day consisted of continuous fast paced customer assistance,directing them to items or pulling stock from the back room for them.  I worked in several departments over 18 years.  In Pharmacy I was the over-the -counter help.  In Produce, I stocked the shelves constantly and culled consistently. In Apparel, I folded clothes and stocked from the back room. I learned how much customers relied on an associate's help but the hardest part was trying to do what all the different new managers expected of you, even when they may have disagreed.  I loved helping the customers and seeing all of the ones I got to know over the years. The culture could stand some improvement by showing more respect for the employees."
good,"Its Walmart they give you great benefits and competitive pay. Long days or nights, upper management takes lots of time off and doesn’t lead just demands. market management and up seem uninvolved and to good for the hourly or assistant managers."
good,"Worked  and dealt with many tasks, lifting, large objects while friendly and personable. Working in a timely manner, this job helped me to learn the gift of hard dependable and being responsible and courteous."
good,"Nothing gets resolved if there's issues, and made me not want to work there. I loved most people I worked with who also  had the same hate for wal mart."
good,Expect more from management . People have their favorites and some are VERY RUDE. You can make a career out of Walmart and experience a lot of different positions and jobs available.
good,"The point system was unfair , the management had stockers do all the work and over worked us on pallets but other than that it was a good paying job for me at the time"
good,"Typical day was just unloading product from the trucks onto pallets, Wrapping the pallets for shipment and Then at the end of the shift would have too clean all dock areas"
good,"Bastante cobranças para poucos retornos."
good,It was nice working there I just had a personal problem I only got a 15 minute break for a 5.30 hour shift and I was pregnant I needed a little more time to eat.
good,most days are slow and near the end of the day is a little boring. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with everything and the management's orders.
good,"Your main job will be to provide carts for customers. You will sometimes have to do carry outs & carry ins for customers. (Usually carry outs). It's basically helping customers lift stuffs. You will also do batteries meaning you will have to just transfer the battery from the front end to the back of the store. IMO, doing the batteries are sort of fun. Sometimes, you will have to do some in-store works such as sorting out items or decorating the store but that happens almost never. (once in 1 month). So as i said in the beginning, your main job is to provide carts for customers. My first day was very hard. I was thinking to myself ""Is this the right job for me? This was extremely physically demanding."" But like 3 weeks later, I got used to it and now I have been doing this job for just over 1 year. Honestly, if you are physically fit (If you are not then you WILL get physically fit) then this job will not be a hard job at all. Just make sure to drink store provided ice water & suncreen and you will be fine. You can think of this job as getting paid to work out. I have an app on my phone that lets me know how many steps I have taken over a day and on a busy day, if I work 8 hours shift, I even go upto 35,000steps or about 30km. This might look like a huge number but it is not that bad at all!"
good,Walmart is a high paced work environment where you are expected to preform your job very quickly and some times under unrealistic expectations. The people who work there are really great people but the job can be mentally taxing with some of the issues the company has with its management.
good,Walmart is a decently paced job where you get to work with a respectable amount of people. Jobs at Walmart are more of a revolving door job. So the employees that stay are either worked to death and get passed up for job advancement or get promoted above the people who were there and have more experience than them.
good,The job was ok while I was a student but did have opportunities for advancement.  Some managers were willing to work well with employees others were not.
good,There are good days and there are bad days. Walmart is fast pace and changes every day it seems like. Walmart is a good place for someone that just worries about work and nothing else. You don’t get much family time. I recommend Walmart to the people that only care about work. They have wonderful benefits and almost every employee is a joy to be around.
good,Was fast paced all the time it seemed you can never ever go passed 40 hours if you are full time whether they need people or not the people you meet seem nice and the hardest part is probably meeting their time sheets and cooking inside their unair condition trailer for 3 hours while unloading.
good,"O Walmart é uma excelente empresa, a qual vem passando por uma grande transformação."
good,They need to work on how to talk to their associates properly. When someone applies for a position that is open they need to give a fair chance to everyone
good,"If you are in college and you need a job, Walmart is the place to go. If you are about to retire and you need a place with benefits, Walmart is the place to go but if you think of starting a career in Walmart, think again."
good,It's good company to work for if you don't have kids because you will miss out on a lot of there activities unless you only work during the day but if you don't have your availability open you won't get a lot of hours or move up in the company.
good,The hardest part of the job was not being able to move up on the company. And not being able to provide customers with merchandise because we didn't carry it
good,"All types of people work and/or shop there. You'll quickly find that there are plenty of fresh feet to fill your shoes if you fail to meet their standards. Some have worked there so long that they've nearly given up. Some are so green that they can't even see their managers' apathy for working there. We know we're the empire, but none of us feel like we can actually make a difference."
good,I loved working there! The customers are normally great and can make your day.. the time flys by! the work is never super hard but attention to details is a must. The management team was the hardest to deal with.. some of them have very little people skills and are lazy.. you will find the lazy people get promoted faster than anyone. plenty of opportunity to learn and help people.
good,"They have all the benefits you could get (401K, Health etc.) the pay and most of the management could do some improvement. It's definitely not a place to stay forever, well at least for me. If you need a job it's great for the fact they pay okay and have things you need but if you have better opportunities I'd highly suggest going somewhere else. Good learning experience job, not greatest career job"
good,"Very fast paced, also very competitive work environment. Can be quite stressful at times, however the pay is above average. Most the management is quite helpful."
good,I don't think i need to say anything more than crazy! If you have ever worked for walmart or know someone who has then you already know.  Work life balance is completly terrible.
good,"Walmart expects you to have an ""Open Availability"" with the hours and days that you can work."
good,"Good Benefits, started at above minimum while being a student"
good,The management team wasn’t the best we were always made to run the store on little to no coverage. The only real enjoyable parts of the job was building relationships with your coworkers
good,Summary speaks for it self. Management is poor at best. They don't care about employees at all. All that matters is that the numbers are being made. They take away more than they give.
good,"I worked in the produce area in Walmart. I started out and liked it at first till about 5 months in. I got sick from having to get rid of the rotten fruit everyday and they wrote me off everyday after. The management did not seem to care one bit about my health or my inability to get the job done at night at the time. I am sure other Walmart's in Ohio are great. The one in Marion, Ohio was an awful experience with decent people working there."
good,Its a great starting job. Advancement to upper management can be done quickly but be prepared to work your life away and barely a thank you for killing yourself.
good,"This wasn't a bad place to work, but the management team here is extremely incompetent. I was fired because I requested time off to attend my brother's funeral. I was told that I didn't give them an advanced notice so the time I missed counted against my attendance"
good,"The best part of working at Wal-Mart is interacting with the public many of whom have I have a friendly acquaintance and serve daily by meeting their requests; keeping stock neat and orderly. I have developed skills in problem solving, conflict resolution, and meeting expectations. One can get stuck in position and schedule. Pay is typically low and hours are regulated based on sales the previous year."
good,"Walmart as a company is ok I don’t like the new scheduling because it’s costing people their job but upper management is horrible, everyone with a title uses it as a power move and doesn’t know how to treat people with respect they think they can talk to you any type of way."
good,"In my experience of working with Walmart I dealt with inconsistent working hours, high stress work shifts with minimal to no help, and shift work out in extreme weather without much compensation. This job is super simple and easy to get hired for, but I don’t believe it pays fairly enough given the amount of effort it typically takes. Not super employee oriented due to the company being so large. My hours were constantly cut and the shift was highly understaffed"
good,"Management refuses to fix their mistakes with scheduling. But they will ask everything of you, they just won't give you any slack. And they schedule you to work outside your trained job description."
good,"Working at Walmart was okay when I first started, but if you have other jobs/activities/college/school it’s not the place for you. But other than that it’s okay"
good,The management was better than most that i have worked. The coworkers in my area were pretty great. Sucks that when you are part-time you are not given the same benefits as someone with full-time hours.
good,"Stressful work environment, changes in rules are made almost on a weekly basis, some of the Managers are incompatant and expect you to  do more than you can in your shift time. The occurances changes are very much unfair to employees."
good,Walmart was fun to work at in the beginning. It became tedious and dreadful. Management would make you feel at fault for customer dissatisfaction. If you were part time you would not get the same benefits as a full timer yet get the same work schedule as a full timer.
good,"Not a bad job depending on which Walmart you work at, a lot of people have left the job due to poor management skills from most of the managers. Some of the managers have bad people skills."
good,"The Management team typically makes all their decisions using limited information and rash judgments. They never investigate why things don't get done, or why goals don't get accomplished, they just assume people are lazy or they're not working hard enough. Half of the management team is lazy and stands around and talks most of the time, and later has the nerve to scold their associates for talking while working like they're in middle school. Salaried Management never leads by example."
good,A typical day at work in walmart was going in unloading the truck taking out the products on the carts and stocking them. the hardest part of the job was my supervisor he would expect too much work from me and i was new on my training day.
good,"It can either help you or hurt you. But if you're ur coming to make money and friends, you will go far. Don't depend on others. Focus on yourself and you will prosper.great pp though."
good,I worked there as a stocker the job was run by terrible managers. But made a decent wage every two weeks so I’d say it’s worth it. I got fired for a cashier hitting me and I hit her back. Oh well
good,"Maybe things have gotten better but when I worked at Stone Road Walmart, the employee turnover was insane. Granted there were plenty of students that would be leaving and joining every year but that happens at most workplaces. Assistant Managers would be over worked (salary) and as a result it all trickled down onto the hourly employees. AMs could be very manipulative with how they would advise to do a job, so that it would benefit themselves as much as possible even if it caused problems for other departments. Example being say you ran out of time to bin O/S, some managers would say just cram it into a window in the back and forget it as someone else will eventually have to fix it or lets over stock a product to get it out of the backroom, but hey that job is done now right? Its possible to move up fairly quickly if you drink the KoolAid within the company but moral is very low and raises sucked, capped at $0.40 a year. Promotions to DM could result in a $0.80 raise, if your truly blessed maybe you might get a 'merit raise' that they secretly give out if you complain loud enough behind closed doors, though its normally only $0.25 which really doesn't change much of anything. Walmart is a great company to use as a stepping stone to build your resume for another company that will actually give a crapp about you, or at least do a better job pretending they do."
good,"Cap Team 2 is horrible, the people you work with are usually imbeciles and you're constantly rushed. You're annoyed by the supervisors asking when you'll be finished stocking your freight and they expect you to stay over but if you don't they tend to get revenge by coaching you even though it's against company policy."
good,"I work the night shift because I had to attend school. I am trying to look for a job in the county, school districts or a company that works with kids that are in the welfare system. this was just temporary for me. The warehouse does pay more than the stores."
good,it started off good but they needed better management there but over money paid good. they really didnt teach me anything i had to learn everythig on my own.
good,"NA "
good,"This job was good in the beginning and then they made a lot of changes that were not good for the employees, they should really work on the people they allow to be managers."
good,Management was sloppy telling everyone business never fixing real problems but there workers are really hardworking people that get the job done. Lovevand miss them they where truly Like a family
good,"Walmart is a great place foe entry level experience. Never had a job before, this is the place to go for that first time structure. If your able to find your calling there and advance then might find an actual career."
good,"Walmart was an ok place to work at. Their schedule for your hours is horrible, but flexible. It was much easier to get time off then to get actual hours. Their managers, for the most part, are terrible. A lot of hypocrisy on work ethic from managers and higher ups. Coworkers on the same “level” as you were all great people, but you can tell everyone hates their job. It’s hard to be around."
good,"It’s a good place to work, but if you leave and try to get a job there again, they won’t give you the time or day. Their hiring system is silly. You can’t speak to a real person to see about getting a job."
good,I learned to be a good cashier and to work in the Customer Service Desk.  It was a good experience until the Front End Manager was replaced with a not-so-nice person.
good,I was promoted to manager within 2 weeks and only received a 10 cent raise. Busted my butt and wasn't allowed a flexible schedule. Was told if I wanted morning shift M-F I HAD to work nights Saturday and Sunday. Left with no choice and pay was not nearly enough to cover cost of living at the time.
good,I like working for Walmart but their point system is no good it’s easy for you to lose your job. I like working with my fellow employees and meeting different people
good,The management at the Walmart I worked at were absolutely horrible. They set almost impossible tasks for you to do each day. Very stressful and unwelcoming environment.
good,"I had a fun/good time working there but I got treated poorly, I was on the remodel team and there were people that would come in that were our bosses and they were from a higher management team, and they just yelled at me for no reason when I was working really hard and getting my stuff done and helping others get there's done as well, but one of the guys cussed me out just because I said ""Yes,Sir.""  apparently it's ""Disrespectful"". And it was just dumb stuff like that. But after the remodel was over I asked people I used to work with how it was and they said it was a lot better than it used to be."
good,We start of by getting returns for our Designated aisle you are going to stock for the day.After that you will zone that aisle and make sure there is no trash on the aisle.
good,There are many times that we are understaffed and we are told by management that they fill the hours given to them by the corporate office. management does a poor job of communicating policy and procedure changes.
good,Working at the company isn't that bad. The main issue is terrible decisions being made around you and the lack of sensitivty consideration given. Questionable decisions for promotions.
good,"Specifically where I worked at, the management was very poor. I was lied to about my work and that's what caused me to quit. If you are wanting to work there for a while, I would recommend it but watch for the management at these stores."
good,"I did enjoy this job, the customers and the manager for the cashier's was pretty nice. Now for anyone who gets paid salary, they're not all that great and definitely made me dislike the job."
good,Long Hours 0330-1730. Constant language issues. Very high volume fast paced environment. Felt as though there was too much expected office/paperwork time and not enough direct management time.
good,I enjoyed working with the customer it was good enjoy interacting with people and you get all kinds that’s what made the job interesting you learn a lot about people and how to interact with them
good,"at this walmart, you do the job of 1.5 to 3.0 people per person depending on which dep you are in, the pay is decent to good for the county/area we are in(Fannin), some opportunities for advancement but not very often. In the back areas of the store aka receiving etc there is no room to work conditions are unsafe sometimes in receiving, we receive the amount of freight for a small supercenter but the store was built for lower volume so cramped working conditions in the back."
good,"Did a lot of backroom work, some things were confusing on how they did it. Other than that it was pretty easy, helped other departments occasionally. Stocked up front aisles as well."
good,"Walmart has a big culture, and with the right managment team, it can be a long term career if you are interested in retail. However advancement in pay is not as quick regardless of youre hard work."
good,Management isn’t that great but they have great benefits and buy food for the workers. Also they have bonuses every 3 months so that’s great. Overall.
good,Management needs complete overhaul before anyone considers working at 3799. The store is newly remodeled yet it still runs like a rusty Model T. Workers aren't valued and the turnover rate is incredibly high
good,"It isn't a terrible place to work unless you had my manager. I hadn't encountered problems until they switch my manager. That being said, there aren't many upsides to working there either. I was told by people that worked there for 5+ years that you cannot advance, which was bad because they did not offer full-time positions to non-supervisors. There was also drama between associates but I can't blame Walmart too hard for that."
good,The job was fun at first until the recent management changes after that it kind of went downhill from there it was already hard enough working understaffed
good,"Walmart has shifted its original core values immensely over the last few years, specifically Sam Walton's belief in valuing the people who work for you. Corporate restructuring decisions are being made with little regard for the people who gave 20, 25, 30+ years of their life in service to the company. People have become simply a number to add or subtract to their bottom line. This disregard trickles all the way down from the corporate board room in Arkansas, to the regional, local, small groups of managers who hold painfully significant power over an individual's career and livelihood. Position placement decisions are being made by small groups of biased, incompetent, inexperienced, management cliques who care more about maintaining friendships than making integrity based decisions.  Imagine giving YEARS of your life, years of Thanksgivings, Christmases, birthdays, anniversaries, graduations etc. in service to the company, to be pushed out OVERNIGHT , with little to no warning. These are loyal people with consistent year over year, good performance evaluations who genuinely EARN their paychecks. Sad reality when an outstanding and consistent job performance is not enough to secure a job with the largest and most profitable retailer in the world. Sam Walton is turning in his grave."
good,"I began working for Walmart in 2017, I have been with the company for 2 years. I’ve only relocated once, due to not getting many hours. Within my first year of working there, it was a fun and comfortable work environment. Walmart is basically what you make out of it. If I could change one thing about Walmart I would change the management."
good,"I did enjoy helping out customers and making people smile. I didn't feel like the company cared about us (the employees). I would have multiply customers come up to me and say they feel sorry for us because they don't see any management structure. If we had a problem and we went to management and they had to go to corporate with it, the problem would take forever to be solved. I though Wal-Mart word improve in the last seven years but, I'm disappointed to say it hasn't. At least not were I'm from."
good,"stressful, only because of the customers. i was a cashier, I disliked having to take an hour long break, it makes for a longer day, less work hours. I think they should hire all employees 40 hours plus health care benefits."
good,"Everyday going through the procedure of getting stuff ready for the day, checking freight, plus helping customers they come first. Making sure my associate has projects that need to be done for the day."
good,"Walmart was my fist real retail job and it honestly wasn't that bad. I was customer experience for about 7 months and honestly enjoyed it. My co-workers were nice and my manager was very nice and understanding. The hours are hit or miss, but if you just need a good side-job/part time type of thing, it's pretty good."
good,When I started working for Wal Mart it was a great company but over the years there have been a lot of changes and some are great but here lately everyone is always worrying if they will have a job or not! My typical day is from 4 pm till 1 am and I love working with everyone and try to help everyone but I do have to follow the rules with the company. I have learned a lot of great things with company but we have new management in and things are just not the same. It is hard to get help or even talk to them.
good,I learned how to use a cash register & I made friends. That is kinda it. They didn't really do much once I got up front. Red lining. Standing at the end of the register otherwise that all they want you to do is just stand there.
good,"Good place to work, not much benefits for part time employees. relaxed environment, can be high paced at times.  Advancement is possible however will require relocation to another store."
good,"I couldn't get along with some people, I couldn't keep up with some of the changes, and I couldn't keep up with the pace they had going...it was very stressful."
good,"The best part is the money. The job paid 18.75 starting, with a 25 cent raise every 6 months for 2 years, there was also a bonus based on team goals that you would receive for having good attendance, around another dollar per hour. At the time of my employment we needed 75 plus people to be ""fully staffed"" or just to stop borrowing employees from out of state. The hours were brutal starting at 3 am, and lower management incompetent. You are REQUIRED to come in on days when you are not scheduled with little or no notice, and will be written up should you don't show. The difficulty of the job varies by the day and you have to meet numerous goals or be written up, regardless of the circumstances surrounding the failure, such as there being nothing to do for over an hour. All in all, if you like money and can pass the drug test, you should apply. JUST DONT ORDER FILL mandatory 15 hr days..."
good,I never knew what to expect on a daily basis. In the online shopping dept it may be very busy all the time or sporadic . I learned that the e commerce aspect of the business is thriving and necessary. The hardest part of the job is telling customers their order is delayed or damaged. and of course the heavy days during holiday season. I enjoyed steady activity.
good,"As a personal shopper you must walk all over the store picking up customers groceries and necessities. Then at a specific time customers arrive and you must go to their cars to place the order in their trunks. Everything is based off of a timed schedule where if an order falls behind, then every other order will be delayed."
good,"It isn't as bad as most people make it out to be but also isn't exactly the best of places. I personally had no issues with management and was friends with basically all my coworkers. The biggest issues I had was that they refused to hire more people then they were willing to making it difficult to work especially around the holidays and Christmas time and are very inconsistent when it comes to hours. As an electronics sale associate they tasked me with not only electronics and photo center, but also required me to assist in infants, crafts, hardware, cart pushing and the like."
good,"Walmart DC was not the best place to work. The managers only cared about production and never the employees. You make nice money, but you have to work EXTREMELY hard for it, and if you do not make production you are always in fear of loosing your job. Overall I would not go back, but if you do not care about any of these things, this is the perfect place for you!"
good,"The hardest part of the job was when we were short handed of employees. I had to do all the work by my self so that was kind of hard for me. Some time I had to stay late to get the work done. But I learned a lot in that company, thanks to that now I have more experience."
good,"At first it was a great job, really flexible and helped me pay my bills while I was in school. After that though they really cut my hours and it was hard to have that extra money once bills were paid. Another thing that I didn’t like was the constant change in management."
good,"The rest of the store jobs look non insufferable, but being a cashier is something that you do NOT want at this Walmart. The supervisors are NOT friendly, if you say good morning or try to make small talk you get overlooked. They’re “cliquey” and show high favoritism to other employees. If you call for them to come help you they take their time."
good,"I was unfortunate to have a manager that was not friendly or encouraging. If you made a mistake, it was bad. If you did a good job, it was not good enough. It has the potential to be a good job for people wanting to get job experience."
good,"There was an over riding feeling of negativity in the Walmart.culture.i felt that we  were more motivated to obey to the guidelines or else something might be taken away. True that if one punched in exactly on time every shift, and in and out for break time and was almost never sick, then monetary bonuses were available. It felt like the stress was on, 'don't do this', not 'DO this'."
good,"days were productive, learned a lot about the salesfloor, display, how sales work. When i worked in auto i learned a lot about oil, tools used to work on cars, and everything that had to do with changing and fixing tires. Management was professional. workplace was nice and friendly. the most enjoyable part of working in walmart was the people i talked to."
good,"Due to recent changes there seem to be insufficient workers at busy times. This leaves many to fulfill more than one position. They do make every effort to position those with disabilities, both permanent and temporary, where they can work around their limitations.  The hardest part of my job is perform the more basic parts of it while on the lookout and positioning for the more proactive parts.  The most enjoyable part is getting to know and interact with both coworkers and customers."
good,"Let's see what to say about Walmart..... "
good,"Walmart is a great store, but working for them they are very disorganized at times and management did not always make the best decisions. When the time came for when busy times were expected (Black Friday) they were very organized."
good,"Overall Walmart is a good company to work for but like any company, the manager makes the job. I have left the company and come back a couple times and as long as you had a good work record and left in good standing,  they are good to rehire."
good,"The company used to be really good in the last couple years it has changed and not for the better. It really depends on who your manager. the wage is not bad the hours are not very good if you're looking for full-time their full-time hours can be 28 hours a week that's it.."
good,The jobs themselves are not awful. The company however does not encourage a work life balance. They want you available all the time and if you have an outside commitment they are often not supportive of this as a company. They change jobs and the qualifications of them so frequently that you often fear for your job or fear that you will no longer be able to stay in your position.
good,"Very monotonous, but if you're able to zone out and just think about stuff all day its relaxing. You walk about 10-13 miles a day, and you're outside which is really nice, so you're getting paid to exercise and lose weight which is a perk they don't advertise. If you don't slack off and do your job nobody will complain about you, and there is some positive reinforcement. The bar is so low for being ""awesome"" as I found out, so if you're on this site you are probably above walmart's median for trait conscientiousness and will have a swell time."
good,"It's not a bad place to work, if ya need cash and cant find somewhere else its solid. I cant really say anything bad about the company. It helped me learn skills I needed."
good,"A typical day at work is unloading trucks, stocking items , and giving customers the best experiece they have ever had."
good,"The job at Walmart at times was extremely stressful due to the lack of communication skills and organization of management."
good,I loved my my job even of it was stressful and I did what 3 original associates should have done..to much favoritism....and not enough investigation just ..he said she said..
good,"Working at Walmart allowed me to be a part of a team that is focused on excellence."
good,I love working at Wal Mart don't get my wrong only things management promise things they don't deliver. I'm been working 40 hours haven't got the full time benefits which isn't right. Other then pay good depends on where you go in department.
good,had a job i liked but then they just changed my job completely to a job I was not comfortable doing and gave me no choice but do new job or have no job at all
good,I would recommend WALMART to friends and family for their benefits.  Not much pay and not too many hours. The management I think do over work though and customers
good,Never enough help. Always so busy. Was a better company to work for 10 years ago. So many changes.  They rotate the managers through the stores so that the employees never get close with their boss.  Its hard to change bosses every four or five years.  Never knowing what your boss expects from you is a hard way to work.
good,It is a good job but not enough hours. Looking for a job with 40+ hours a week and weekly pay. I work well with others and im very good at working in a fast paced environment.
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart and making it fun but I didn't like bout it is that sum managers like to get in peoples face and yell in front of people
good,"Expect to be understaffed, expect to be responsible for more than you can do because people call out a lot.  Benefits and pay are better than most of the industry, but it can be a bit of a meat grinder meaning people are quitting left and right and and you'll be dealing with a lot of new people who don't know anything after  you've been there just a short while.  The plus side to this is there's lots of room for advancement, though people who I talked to who DID advance said the extra responsibility and work-load wasn't worth the pay bump.  Also, the customers are a mixed bag with some being kind and courteous and some being complete self-interested entitled jerks, but that's just retail in general."
good,It is a good place for a first job or a career. You work as a team to get the job done and make the customer happy. If you have a good work drive you can move up in the company really quick
good,"Working at Walmart was a nightmare, not because of the work or the customers, but because of management and supervisors. I actually enjoyed working my chemical aisle and aiding customers, but management made it so stressful and strict that I eventually left. Wouldn't recommend working there unless you're reeeally desperate for something."
good,"Answer customers' questions, and provide information on procedures or policies.Bag, box, wrap, or gift-wrap merchandise, and prepare packages for shipment.Compute and record totals of transactions.Count money in cash drawers at the beginning of shifts to ensure that amounts are correct and that there is adequate change.Establish or identify prices of goods, services or admission, and tabulate bills using calculators, cash registers, or optical price scanners.Greet customers entering establishments.Issue receipts, refunds, credits, or change due to customers."
good,This job is very stressful and you onky qualify for certain benifits after you work there so long. They deny you on days you request off in advance. The managers arent very helpful or reliable.
good,My experience at Walmart was not the best the management was poor and my co workers were also not the best I would not recommend this job to anybody unless they had no other option.
good,"leading a team of 15 people "
good,Lots of happy co workers who are eager to help new staff learn & make them feel welcome.
good,Assisting costumers and stocking shelves was the main thing we did everyday. I usually used the forklift and walkie-stacker on a daily basis. Maintaining a clean and safe work environment was important.
good,I worked in the back stocking and unloading trucks. I would put in OT which is great when you were a part time employee but didn't leave much in the way of anything. I was told I would be advancing and then was told my position was temporary and let go.
good,Clicking  people are very clicking at Walmart if you don’t know some there you there not nice.  And the have. No matters  they don’t tr Teach the job  very well
good,Most of the employees are very sweet and helpful. I would recommend my friends or family to work there. It’s a face pace. I like that you never get bored with this job.
good,"Walmart has inconsistancy with the employers,"
good,The entirety of every day of me working at the Farmington Wal-Mart consisted of working with my co-workers and Department Manager. Assisstant Managers and Store Manager only cared about how to boost their numbers for themselves. The associates and my department manager are fantastic people. Anyone above that treated us like a resource to use rather than actual people. I thoroughly enjoy being able to help people with electronics questions and cashing people out in a professional and friendly manner.
good,"Depending on which area you work and your title will depend on your stress and how much mana is on your case. Also, there are high expectations that are impossible to meet."
good,NO more profit sharing. NO more vacation and sick now it is PTO and no more exceeds on evaluations which is what I always got.  I loved Walmart when I started they were family oriented.  Now it is about making money. We used to get raises when they thought we did a good job..  Then it went to once a year on our anniversary..  Now you get it once a year but everyone gets the standard raise they took away exceeds and role model
good,The people I worked with ended up teaching me more about my position than management did. Management did not seem as available as they made themselves out to be. Scheduling was also a problem and had to constantly push for hour change and still did not get it.
good,I worked as a cashier at Walmart. In my opinion it's a good starting job for youth but after a while it just gets bad. Cashiers are pressured a lot by management and customers. So your always gonna be stressed. Constantly busy so your always working and working working. The cashiers are treated unfairly compared to the others even though they do most of the work in the store.
good,"Walmart is a decent starting job. The pay was good, and coworkers were typically happy to teach. If you needed a manager's assistance, however, it could be difficult to reach them. You could also be moved to another department at a moment's notice if it was understaffed. This was difficult since they would just leave you there even if you have no knowledge on that department."
good,Helping customers determine and locate what they need specifically. Setup for new and previous contracts and prepaid wireless accounts. Stocking and inventory prep was required on days the truck ran and the previous shift couldn't finish. Customer service is key.
good,"Overall, working at Walmart has its ups and downs. On one hand, you have to juggle the pressures of retail and its strain on your personal schedule. On the other, Walmart offers very competitive pay in comparison to other jobs for a first job."
good,Walmart has just started what they refer to as a high performance culture. This would be a nice idea if the hourly associates were actually invested in the company instead of just themselves. Most of this is through no fault of their own as most management teams just berate and belittle them for not being good enough.
good,"Not a bad place to work for scheduling flexibility. Very understanding, and accommodating to life. Ample opportunity to make up hours, not set schedule. Main problem is they could pay a little more. Pay isn't bad. Everyone is very friendly and willing to help."
good,"a typical day at work was sometimes stressful, and often times there was poor management. associates will call in and management will not bother to find a replacement and there would be a shortage of associates"
good,It was fine when I first started a year ago but four managers later it has become annoying. I haven't received any of the promised bonuses and we let customers walk all over us at the front end. I need to change my hours but get constantly denied. It sucks at least for me.
good,"i enjoyed working there,  i gave them 18 years and they just tossed me to the curb when i got sick.  working there is good.  but management  and the attendance policy sucks."
good,When I worked at Walmart I was a front end cashier. We handled the volume of customers checking out. When you have that many people shopping and coming through your line you get introduced to a huge variety and range of people.
good,The other employees were fun and easy to talk to. Most of the customers were very respectful and understood why I needed to check their receipts as they left the store.
good,Start work at 4 am till 1 pm one hour lunch break get along great with co workers. Very fast pace have to be very organized and very time management orientated
good,It was a decent job. I would not recommend working there if you are not an eager to work person.  There is a lot to do in an 8 hour shift. relocating product takes focus.
good,"When i worked there the management was poor, the store supervisor was not very friendly either as later he was fired for “ethnical issues” my co workers were ok."
good,Got to meet some great people who I loved working with. I enjoyed most of my management team. And the work wasnt too demanding. I just want to try something new
good,This is a very good place for people just entering the United States work force. Skills learned here will progress them into other jobs in the future for both high school ages and immigrants.
good,"i know some people dont mind working at walmart but at this particular location there is no structure, none of the CSMs are competent, and often you end up doing someone elses job. the pay is pretty decent but thats about it."
good,A typical day at work I mean walmart is pretty laid back its like family working with them. I have learned how to treat and respect my customers. I love the customers mist of tjem are very friendly.Management it pretty though they.dont communicate with each other i think the store would run so much better if they communicated.
good,"The job was eh i like the people i worked with but overworked for what i was getting paid, also the management wasnt really reliable and wanted to work with me."
good,I worked overnights at my local Walmart to help pay for college. I stocked shelves and assisted customers. It was pretty laid back over night as long as you got your work completed and were willing to assist others.
good,"Has no care for employees, all about higher up people. No acknowledgement of employees work no holiday pay very lil PTO. Bonus pay decreases for each day missed."
good,People greeter here for 3 years. Was not able to move up or advance because of unfair treatment at the time. There were some really nice associates I worked with though.
good,"Worked evening shift never enough help. Advised to request help when short staffed and response was always ""you gotta just work thru it""."
good,"Worked here for 28 years. Over all it was a good experience. Chances for advancement. But it required so much of your life. Balance between work and home started out good.( It was 1989). But over time the company and management changed! They always say: firm, fair and consistent. Which is not the truth any more. Not fair or consistent."
good,"I loved my job and enjoy working with customers. I take pride in what I did and my coworkers were like family. "
good,"I work there and I did almost everything inside that store, and I try to move up they said no even when I got a perfect record. They have to give more opportunities to move up."
good,Some of the managers are rude and stay on their phone. They dont pay attention to breaks. Other than that walmart is a nice place to work for starting off
good,Working at Walmart is good for people that are wanting to go to school because they are flexible to your schedule.  Depending on the store with the management can either put you in good positions or put you in a bind to where they do not care about you or your situation. If you want to get paid then you need to move up quickly but the pay for certain positions is not worth the hassle unless you go straight to assistant manager position.  The pay sucks for the entry level and for what you are required to do like stocking.
good,Highly recommended. Decent pay every 2 weeks. Sumtimes friendly coworkers. Occasionally lunches in the breakroom were free from company hard working employees.
good,Wal-Mart is a great place to work. I love my job. Wal-Mart has changed a lot over the years. Change is the hardest part of my job. We change with the times and sometimes that's overwhelming.
good,Walmart is a stressful place to work. They have changed so much. There isnt much room for advancement. And the healthcare isn't that great.  They are cutting hours and giving more and more work for a skeleton crew.
good,"Management was over worked so not enough time to properly deal with customer issues and keep track of employees, ex change needed, BREAKS, BREAKS and helping problem solve with employees when employees feels the need for assistance."
good,It’s a good job to maintain. Easy job duties. Can be difficult at times just because of customers and management. Management does not help when it is busy and the is always busy. Could hire more people to be more effective.
good,Worked in -30 degree freezer orderfilling food orders for all Walmart stores within the southeast district. Hard work and very stressful but does pay ok.
good,"Typical day would be stocking the backroom and placing items in the correct department spots onto the pallets . Stocking the floor when needed . When delivery comes, I pull item off the truck line and place them into the right department pallet"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart. There were alot of people to remember, some of which I am still in contact with today. I just wish that the management was slightly better."
good,I have nothing to say about working for walmart. my time at walmart does not influence my decision making skills or my work ethic. I will not sat anything negative
good,"Stocking shelves, continuously rotating throughout the day, helping customers with any questions. Great thing is the discount card you receive. The amount of donations they do for children's miracle network"
good,"As a Former working from Walmart"
good,i enjoyed my time here . just didnt get enough hours so hi had to seek other employment . walmart employees become family and i liked that aspect alot
good,"not enough cashiers are available to meet the needs of the customers"
good,I’m only there because I haven’t found another line of work yet.  The managers abuse there power. Do not care what you think. Talk bad about you behind your back. and many other thing so
good,Fast paced enjoyable work atmosphere I really enjoyed the comraderie as well as the safe working environment my managers were extremely nice and beneficial to me.
good,The work can get tedious on cap 2 a lot of the weight of the store is carried on our backs. We couldn’t afford to have bad days which inevitably led to many bad days since we don’t get many “breather day” to relax
good,It's ok place to work fast paced  place has friendly coworkers  some favoritism but you get that every where some very rude customers  but over all good place to work
good,I find that a persons personal attitude they bring into the work place usually effects how others respond to them. While Honor Integrity and Commitment are very important it seems the abilities to inspire a positive attitude in others and to react to others in a similar positive way.
good,Was with the company for many years. Political and depending on management can be very non motivational. Seen 1 manager who was acually great. Stressful and overworked.
good,The Distribution center Could use some improvement with the management staff. They have amazing people that work for the company that works very hard.
good,"I feel that my time at Walmart has been valuable because I have learned how to deal with people in a more positive way.  I have learned how to use a pallet jack, forklift, as well as how to read a mod sheet and set up displays by corporate standards while working as well.  "
good,"A typical day at work at Walmart is very productive, there is always something that can be done. The management were not so kind and did not inform you on how to do certain things."
good,"I have friends in New York and Washington who work for Walmart and get confused at the horror stories I told them from ours. it was understaffed to the point some employees who harass others would get away with it because management didn't want to lose labor. ASMs tried but would get shot down from general management. favoritism was and hear still rampant. Even heard general management go ""no they couldn't do that there like a mother to me"" when 4 people were fired one because they went to a funeral. The only real complaint I have from the actual work is it's hard to work when management is visibly panicking and yelling as if their life depended on it. I didn't hold it against them as I could see the panic was handed to them and not actually theirs."
good,"Opportunities to become certified with powered equipment and develop customer service skills. "
good,Walmart is like most places with day to day issues. With staff shortages you will find yourself being moved around to help. If needing work experience is a good place to start. For  long term  employment can cut hours without warning making long term plans difficult.
good,Very disorganized. Schedule changes made verbally were not updated causing unfair negative occurrences on attendance record. Pay did not match the hard stressful work needed to be done. Training disorganized- I felt I was thrown into my position and taught myself by asking questions and observing. Mistakes could have been prevented if communication with supervisors had been better- almost obsolete. I never saw my direct supervisor. He was busy and never available for his department unfortunately.
good,"Walmart is a great stepping stone for someone who may be attending school to better themselves while earning money to survive. It's a hit and miss with management, some are very nice and easy going and some are very brutal in terms of the way they run the store and YOU. I do miss my time there. Meet some great people who turned into family."
good,Its a nice place to work expect the management team at store #2580...the overall experience I had was ok expect the managers does not take their job as serious  as the regular workers
good,"Most people are hired part time.  It might take you a long time to earn full time, to get benefits, and better pay.  It can be hard to deal with the public, at times.  You are always watching for theft."
good,"There wasn't too many strict rules. As long as you knew your task for the day, you were good and just ask your supervisor questions.Hardest part of the job was pleasing the customers."
good,A typical day at work involved stocking shelves and putting away overstock in the back. Some of the people working were sometimes vaguely racist and very gossipy.
good,"Ive held many positons in this company. From cashier to Assistant Manager "
good,"A typical day at Walmart includes a very fair amount of interaction between customers, dealing with customers has helped me learn how to come up with problem solving resolutions, to be prompt & patience, and make sure that our customers leave out well taken care of & satisfied."
good,A lot of the times they will do cake or cupcakes for employee birthdays. Every Friday at the end of the month they give us free donuts we get annual raises of 10% they provide locker for your personal stuff and a breakroom. Its very fast paced but relaxed at the same time
good,Working for Walmart was not much as new experience for me it felt like working a warehouse job but I never like my job was to hard my daytime manager and supervisor were the best boss I could have but the night manager was very unprofessional
good,I work outside all day in the rain or shine. We work alot of long hours in the sun and don't get paid enough for the amount of work we put in. Management isn't the best they pick favorites a lot.
good,"Depending on who's working (aka the good CSM's or the bad CSM's), they tell you where to go before you even clock in, they ignore your requests when you need them for things like cash, questions, bathroom breaks, and water breaks. They stand around and gossip, not even looking at the palm. But if you do the same thing, you get in trouble. If you meet the right people, its great, I've made a few amazing friends. But you could go above and beyond, then do one small thing, like take a breather after a customer before you go red line, and you get told you're not doing your job."
good,"The hours were long sometime and the work can get stressful at times, but overall the job itself isn’t too bad! The customers were kind of hit-and-miss, some were incredible friendly and grateful, others hostile and rude."
good,"If you can put up with the high stress of the managers for which customers will apologize to you for them as they berate you publicly, the pay is good."
good,"Walmart is all about management and your team. Corporate ha no idea what it's really like working in the store. You are supposed to follow ""policy"" but if a customer makes a fuss they will give them their way. It's a lot like high school"
good,Multitasking environment with the ability to promote associate with little to no experience on the job there getting hired for.  Does not give enough training.
good,"I did not have a good experience with Walmart, though to be fair people weren't as aware of Autism as they are now. It was simply too big a store for me to work at as I would frequently be asked about the location of items outside of my department. I would need to turn to fellow coworkers (had no radios at the time) for help with this which resulted in unhappy customers. I do not recommend working at Walmart if you can't take disrespect as well as you give it. Not everyone, ESPECIALLY at Walmart, will reciprocate it, though I think that's common knowledge at this point."
good,great place to meet a lot of great people.....great melting pot of people...in both the people you work with and the customers...I love making my customers feel like number one
good,"The good part of working at Walmart is the money. However the bad parts include the Walmart culture, how your supposed to do things, lack of communication, new company changes that are awful. It’s just not worth suffering."
good,"A typical day working at Walmart consists of getting to work, punching in, and heading up front to a register. Nothing really ever changes, and ""exciting things"" almost never occur. Employees are assigned to a register, and they must stay there and check out customers until they are told by management that they may either take a break, or leave at the end of their shift."
good,"Es un lugar tolerable para trabajar, los jefes son con los que se tiene más problemas no ven lo que uno hace sin importar el empeño que se le ponga al trabajo por ende es difícil subir de puesto. Aunque subir de puesto desde PA  no hay muchas opciones lo que sigue es ser de Rh o jefe de algún depto."
good,"Good co-worker environment. Inconsistent and lack of hours. The money wasn't great but the discount helped out. The manager for my section was great, he passed on knowledge and trained us beyond our title jobs. The managers beyond that were detached and only available when something/someone was bad. Overall I enjoyed my experience with Walmart but I feel like if they could dedicate just half the effort they put into customer services to employees they would be a great place to work and grow with."
good,management should work well with workers to try to make work more fun let them feel like they want to be at work try to compromise with them and make them feel like a home.
good,"A  typical work day is simple enough regardless of position"
good,"Typically, a day at work consists of unloading a general merchandise truck by hand with between six and eight people. Then, we go to stock the merchandise on the sales floor. That really is the whole job. Sometimes everything gets finished, and sometimes we just don't have enough people to get the job done. The only things that I have learned are about stocking and using the equipment inside the store like the baler and the pallet jack. The management there can be nice, and they can be mean, but most of them are just there to get their job done and go home. The culture of the workplace is friendly and enjoyable most days. The hardest part of the job is the amount of physical activity that is endured on a daily basis. Finally, the most enjoyable part of the job for me are the people I get to work with because we have all grown to become friends over the years."
good,"It s a hard job. Physically and mentally. . It was also hot. I worked on dry side. It would get up to 130 degrees n Warehouse. "
good,Walmart back in Missouri is where I worked and I loved my team there! I was sad to leave but had to relocate to Washington for personal reasons. As I moved out here I looked for other place of employment because I didn’t like the people from personnel and the way they came to me before I even started
good,"Very fast paced, which is not a bad thing at all. Depending on your management team and whether or not they will teach you what you need to succeed is a gamble. Some stores are better than others."
good,"Easy job, no thinking involved. Customers become draining. Job is tedious. Sometimes felt more like a machine than a human. The pay was fine and held me over as a young adult, could not live off of."
good,"I have to ring customers up"
good,Very nice coworkers and clean environment. Steady place to work. I would recommend Walmart to anyone that is starting out or just needs more experience or extra cash
good,Appreciate Walmart for the ability to work. I was able to learn new job services. I was able to serve many different people of different cultures and races.
good,The work condition was mostly alright. You do have managers that do not careabout what is going on. There could be better management with people doing their jobs properly.
good,"I was a cashier for the first 6 months. I enjoyed the regular customers. They enjoyed that I remember them and I bagged their items to their liking. I moved to an overnight stocker to work more hours. I was given the toys department around Christmas. We had a minimum of 15 pallets we had to unload a night, which was a work out. The overnight crew was fub to work with. We also received bonuses depending on how well our store did. At this job there was always something to do. The days went by fast. The only problem I did have was at the end when I wasn't able to change my days off. That is when I had to sadly leave."
good,"Empresa com bons benefícios, valorizam os seus colaboradores"
good,Great experiences nice and friendly people and nice management you get a good salary per hour and make enough to live in a house/apartment near by working for Wal Mart was the best the people really are wonderful
good,Coworkers were great to work with. Overtime was available. Some managers were good to work for. Work environment was adequate. Opportunities for advancement was available.
good,"Walmart isn't a bad place to work if you live with someone, you don't get overtime, and the managers aren't understanding, they don't like being told how it is."
good,"starting out getting told where to begin the shift "
good,A typical day at work is always customer focused. Being able to take care of the customer at the  best of my ability the hardest part about the job would be if I was not able to give them what they needed. The most enjoyable was that at the end of the day the customer was satisfied.
good,"The pay was fair to start could always be more.  Management is very unorganized with scheduling and never knows what is going on. "
good,Great place to begin your management skills and find out what kind of manager or leader you want to be.  Then finding out if you jive with the company.  But the company changes so frequently that it seems they do not have or foster the basic beliefs of Sam Walton anymore.
good,I loved my job as a personnel training coordinator. I love helping people who have poor computer skills navigate and complete whatever they are trying to do on the computer.
good,Wouldn't let me move to morning hours after summer started. The CSM are good sometimes have to remind them about your break. It gets really busy in the afternoons at the beginning of the week.
good,Too much to comment on.. The managers there are very biased with the employees. Some lack communication skills and poor skills in managing. They do not listen to the concerns of employees.
good,"A company is only as good as it’s associates and it’s associates are only as good as the managers and Walmart managers need to do better ."
good,love my job but management is not helpful.  not enough employees to do job correctly.  but love working with public meeting new people.was not this way 5 years ago.
good,Loved my job but there were some poor managers at the time when they let me go. Always have advancement opportunities. Pretty good pay. Good benefits with matching for 401k.
good,Was constantly Harassed cause I had a piercing in my cheek when I took the stud off had Manager come out to make sure it was not on my cheek still an kept getting in rounder for it when they checked twice to see if it was there an it wasn’t
good,Would not make a career out of this.  Stress is not worth the pay.  They ask you to do to much without giving you the resources to accomplish your task.
good,Was a great place to start my work experience the only issue was lack of appreciation for duties performed an i personally worked a management position for over six months never received the proper pay for said position an when i expressed my feelings on the matter was when i lost the job.granted i lost my temper wich i have since worked on my anger extensively overall a good company if u as re careful not to be taken advantage of.
good,i took care of the service desk so there was always something to do or get done. typically i was the only one during the morning and midday shift. taking a lunch was sometimes difficult because there was no one except a mgr to take over. and if they didnt get to you on time you were late to lunch which results in a write up
good,"Walmart is an okay place to work.  It is not the best place I have ever worked, but it is also not where I plan on working forever. My manager is great though and has always been very accommodating with my schedule.  I was in the system as part time and working full time hours.  I did not get paid maternity leave because I didn't know about the stipulations of paying into STD for my LOA because I did not receive a formal orientation when I was hired and was not guided through the process of going through all the nitty-gritty stuff at the beginning."
good,"If you work with the right group of people including management, it can be a fun relaxed place to work.  Some managers are rude to associate's and to customers and get nothing done to them.  Some people if your not in their ""click"" you are treated badly.  Some of the management including the Main Store manager, remind me of high school with their ""click"" and favoritism."
good,Working at Walmart is good most of the time. there are some cons to working there and a lot of Pros. I enjoy my job 95% of the time. Some issues that are addresses to Supervisors seem to be dismissed and some employees seem to work by their own rules and are not talked to by management to fix their work ethics
good,The job is intense and it’s a lot of work and heavy lifting and pallet and stocking work it’s easy just painful and stressful and people tend to get away with not doing anything and you tend to have to do their work so no one gets in trouble. The management is the worst they don’t seem to do anything about the people who are choosing to not do the work but blame the and accuse the ones who do.
good,"The walmart I worked at, their management was not up to part and it showed. They never had any compassion about their employees. They always stick to their point policy over everything."
good,The only things i didn’t like about walmart was no time off because they had a point system & the mangers were way too young & didn’t do there jobs also they would pick favorites
good,"Be yourself. People are fun to work with .."
good,At first was a great place to work many changes have happen and not for the better. Planned on working there a long time but they do not care about the workers.
good,"A empresa é considerada a maior do mundo e, na época, tinha pouca experiência como multinacional. A empresa estava tentando implementar sua cultura de gestão e foi, em determinadas situações, inflexível. O ambiente interno era de alta competitividade e um pouco hostil. Mas foi possível desenvolver um trabalho técnico de RH, ajustando as estruturas salariais, revisando os benefícios e melhorando a gestão das áreas de nutrição (refeitórios) e serviços de medicina do trabalho."
good,"I stoker and clean up the area, I learned customer services, I love when the customer find what he looking for."
good,Everyone has worked for Walmart at one time.  Its an ok job and served its purpose when I needed part time work that was easy and mindless.  They do cut hours on all employees during slow times.
good,"Good management and environment ,fun and easy place to work at.lots of customers and less cashiers during the evening time. flexible enough for students."
good,i really didmt like working for walmart because i was injured why i was pregnant and they denied me physical therapy plus forced me back to work before i could physical do the task
good,Can be a fun and productive at times. Upper management isn't engaged and some don't have training in the areas they are responsible for. This has led me to seek employment elsewhere.
good,"Hours may change but other then that they give you a good working schedule, don’t really like how they don’t acknowledge the employees sometimes but other then that we all work as a team."
good,easy to approach other employee members and management time management was never an issue with a positive crew. I found myself enjoying early morning at work. customers were usually respectful and friendly to talk to. I could always go to upper management with problems and concerns
good,Jib can be difficult and the mangers can be rude and they are never friendly besides the one that I am use to that is about to leave the company bc of the store manager
good,"Walmart had good benefits; pto, 401(k) match, health insurance, etc. They also do a decent job of matching hours to work needs so that there's not a lot of time standing around, and, in general, there's people present when the work is. I also appreciated the lunch policy where the pharmacy would close if there's only 1 pharmacist so the pharmacist could get a lunch. That said, Walmart asks a lot of you, there's not really any room to slack off. Upper management was always poking their nose in asking why things weren't getting done, do more of this, we need more of that. "
good,"A good day at work will be helping customers find the they are looking for and giving advice,also making sure customers children find the things they need to put a smile on everyone's face"
good,"although i was just a store standards, i was basically the everything guy when i used to work here, which is a common thing for a that role in this location. "
good,Any individual job at Walmart is not that bad. Most are relatively easy. The biggest issue is trying to do your job while having to make up for the lack of effort from co-workers. Difficult to want to wake up and go to work where you know no one else cares to successfully accomplish anything.
good,Management would rather hand out gift cards to customers than help to fix the issues they were unhappy with. Management doesn't hold associates accountable for their misconduct. Hard to work with.
good,"My experience in 3 years of Walmart over night . Was interesting. Get to  deal with lot of  different kind of people . "
good,There was no playing around what so every you had to get your job done first before you do anything else. Once your done with everything you have to do you may have a chance to communicate if it’s not so busy.
good,"I really don't like how Walmart would just give you any type of hours if you are part time and not a consistent schedule.  As a associate, I would talk to my manger about my hours and they’ll never fix them"
good,Wal-Mart is a great place to work if you're at a store that has a great manager. Otherwise you are overworked and under paid. Nothing is ever recognized with individual merit if recognized at all. They push you like a robot and treat you like a number. Its all about the numbers to salaried managers and you are replaceable as much as the next guy. The training is horrible there is favoritism and a lot of inner store gossip and drama as is all big box places. Rules and policy only seem to be adhered to when there is a visit from corporate or an employee violates. However the consequences and expectations always greater than what is realistic. High turnover but not as bad since they raised the starting wage to 11.00 an hour.
good,long and hard days but also rewarding days at the same time. you also get a hour long lunch which is pretty nice after cashiering all day. the discounts are also really nice.
good,Interaction with ppl in qll walks if life was interesting conversing abt things they purchased as i rang them up! Some mangers were hard to get along with as if they felt superior due to their title  2 or 3 were down to earth and relatable but their schedule was a set up for failure  some weeks it would be consistent like 8-5 5 days others were like 2pm till 10pm next day 5am to 2pm next day11till 7 then 5am to 2pm being so allover the board was difficult with children hsving to find a sitter somedays with th schrdule all over the place cause me to have to find a more consistent employer
good,I don't know about the rest of the store but the manager of the automotive department showed way too much favoritism and when it came to schedules he gave the best hours to those who were in his little click.As a former manager and business owner I never showed favoritism I gave credit where credit was do.
good,Could've done better on working with employee's school schedule and helping attend school. Should offer moving positions with a raise. Management could be more helpful.
good,Work load is too high for the amount of people employed yet they company still cuts hours and jobs so that stock holders and CEOs can make millions. Management is constantly threatened by market managers about having to stay over and have days off cancelled so as to punish those who do not meet impossible goals . Salary increases are few and they want management to give associates “solid” ratings which is usually 2% increase.
good,Work as fast as they want as safe as possible which in it self seems impossible especially when trip times become shorter forcing the order fillers to move faster in order to keep up all while trying to be safe.
good,"If you are consistent, they recognize that. After all, it is a retail job and they need RELIABLE people."
good,I have worked at Walmart for 4 years my first two years was OK but as time moved on things have gotten horrible. Management don't care about the third shift at all we are always responsible for cleaning up after other shifts and our complaints go unanswered . The job requires you to do so much and when you are not able to finish you hear the complaints from the other shift managers when we never have enough people to cover the night load. By the time I leave in the morning I'm  stressed out because I'm expected to do three departments in one night with no help holidays included and it's just not fair for one person to be expected to do so much the company needs improvement they want to keep there workers.
good,"For the most part I liked the job and the work. I personally like to stay busy, and there was work that could always be done at this facility. I was challenged often, and always exceeded expectations. I didn't like the lack of stability, the staff was often unorganized, and sometimes expectations were very unclear for certain tasks."
good,Nice place to work . Great experience. All the associates there are friendly & helpful. As long as I been work for Walmart the ap team has been the back bone of the store.
good,"I have worked at 2 Walmarts which I loved, and the last Walmart which I did not. It was great for part-time while I was in school but not ideal as a career path."
good,"All walmarts are different and it has it's days, they have a point system that is really crazy if you get 5 points they fire you no matter how good of a worker you are, if you call off on a saturday they automatically give you two points, if you start early without permission they give you a point, if your late they give you half a point!! some managers are rude to the employees, no over time without permission, the most enjoyable part of the job is lunch and going home including learning about the department your in."
good,No benefits and very poor corporate and upper management. You are expected to perform more than one persons work during a day and get more than one days work completed in a shift.
good,Working in the automotive department is fun i enjoy working on vehicles and serving the customers it just sometimes we get complaints for nothing because the customers no that they could get some for free.
good,Working for Walmart I was able to advance fairly quick and attained two raises in less than a year I would rate the company as better than I would rate my individual store experience.
good,Well all have to say I'll never going back to that. They never have what I need. They stack same products in different aisle. Not enough staff for the amount of customers. I guess people go there because it's convenient. The staff is so tired that they don't even smile. I don't blame them. In the products departments is hard to find the plastic bags. I could go on but I'm tired. I just came from there and waiting 30 min to self pay. If you go to the other ones you be there forever.
good,"I learned: Cashier, Self checkout host, Money Service and Customer Service"
good,"There are days where a truck won't come in and it's a little slower. But as time goes on, your body will feel the effects of constant bending over and your share of cardboard cuts. It's not the worst job or a horrible job but it does require some hard work and moving at an increased pace than normal."
good,It's fast paced and you have to multitask helping customers while stocking. One manager was horrible but the rest were pretty good. Good cowokers too.
good,"Fast pace environment communicating with customers. Stick floors while assisting customers. Make shore that every item is placed from older date to the front, and new items from back."
good,Walmart always saids that they have room to improve on investments but they don't really don't and they ask you to have open hours wich is not to bad but than you don't have a home time
good,"Its not a bad place to work at its just take getting use to with the company, people, and managers. just come in and do what is asked from above management and make sure your jobs is done as well, run your area to the best of ability."
good,"This was my first job, met a lot of fun people but half of them gossiped too much. The managers were cool but half of them were plain rude. I lasted 4 months there and there were no increases."
good,Task driven and team motivated company. Learned the responsibility of operating a department to provide continuous customer service.  Gained knowledge of the importance in having inventory that is demographically marketed for our customers.
good,"The Walmart I worked at was considered an acamdey- where training managers came to learn. This took most all of the store managers attention, therefore leaving the associates to fend for themselves. Needless to say management was not the best. And when faced with hostility and harassment in the workplace, I went to a shift manager to resolve the problem. They explained that it was out of their power considering I was only an employee so it wasn’t of importance unless it was a customer complaint."
good,It is a good place to work but there are areas that could be better .more employees to take on the work load and to provide better  customer service. Walmart is on the right track with staying ahead of the curve with technology.
good,not very hard work depending on where you work in the store. The benefits get you by with the accompanied wage. Management is very pushing with the benefits and it never feels like you're going to be missing out on something if you aren't paying attention.
good,"Answered phones, customer service at register, scanned scripts into software system, filled prescriptions as needed, call insurance company to resolve issuess"
good,If you don't want to get appreciated for your job and do the job of others and still get in trouble you should work at walmart. They move up members to managers with no experience so they can manipulate them.
good,los sueldos son muy bajos a comparación de las actividades que realizas
good,"at the time that I worked there i had no manager whatsoever and we had to be told what to do by a supervisor who was always busy with other things so they where always hard to find when something was happening. also not enough equipment for everyone its all first come first serve so if you didn""t get what you needed early you had to find something else to do until you were able to get a hold of a supervisor. because i had no direct supervisor no one was able to work with my schedule, and i would get scheduled to work on the days or the times that i was not available and wrote down on my availability sheet."
good,"Typical retail job with many areas, departments to work in. Flexible shifts change if you talk with the manager of your team. Majority members if the management team are NOT readily available when you need them. They all need to take the time get to know the employees on their team and help get answers to our questions."
good,"Handle cash, credit or check transactions with customers, scan goods and collect payments. Resolve customer complaints, guide them and provide relevant information. Bag items carefully. Greet customers"
good,I assist customers with paying bills in side of our  money center i assist  customers  with sending an receiving money  to a person or a financial  company.  I also audit registers for shortages.
good,Management must get out of the way and let the process work. Sometimes it could be hard to get backing or help needed to make department successful! Hopefully things change so overall store can advance together.
good,Walmart is not a good place to work it's went down hill fast.Managers suck always on your butt have you doing a million things at one time. Don't appreciate you or your work.
good,"The work itself is not that hard, and would be an ideal work environment under better management. the workplace is often chaotic, there seems to be little to no accountability for management, often times management doesn't know whats happening until the last minute, there is frequently performance lost because a lack of knowledge of delivery times / freight amounts. and an inability to accurately access and prioritize work tasks on a daily basis."
good,"fast pace environment , unload trucks, stock, clean stock rooms and sales floor. help customers. mangers had hard time doing tasks due to changing their mind"
good,"My day to day was to replenish the shelves, control on-hand count of merchandise. I trained associates how to stock freight and the backroom. Also involved in customer service."
good,"Walmart pay was great, however I was always working a late shift with no choice to gain a earlier shift. I never had time for my family because I work a lot with this company."
good,Great place to work if you like solving problems for customers and multitasking. Opportunity to succeed depends on how bad you want to. The job can be relaxed or stressful.
good,"For various reasons, people typically find Wal-Mart to be a great short-term, part-time job.Wal-Mart is better than average, or higher favored than a fair amount of other occupations due to their benefits, scheduling flexibility, hours."
good,Walmart does not have enough people on the floor for any given shift.  The workers that are on the floor cannot adequately assist the customers and do their other tasks without rushing or pushing themselves to their limits.
good,To bad the company has began to only care about their income and not the associates or customers. There are to many self check registers and not enough cashiers.
good,Would not recommend this as a career.  Good for if you're also looking for another job or have a lot of time.  Management is mediocre at best and availability doesn't matter; they'll schedule you for whenever they want.  Good for a temporary job or just starting out.
good,at Walmart you are able to socialize and get to know the community you serve as a lot of customers are repeat customers. I feel this gives you a edge to better serve you community and make their shopping experience more enjoyable because you are educated to their needs and wants. The most enjoyable part of my work day is providing customers assistance to those in need to make their experience on that is pleasurable and keeps them returning.
good,"I enjoy working with the customers, I enjoy my job, but I don't like having to come to work at 4am, it is hard to transfer to another area once they get you in bakery or deli."
good,"Pretty decent workplace, management is biased towards specific associates, and customers. Management listens to what you have to say, but sometimes do not take it into consideration."
good,For the most part walmart is a good place to work.  It is a very physical job and fast paced.  They are quick to hire but also quick to fire.  *********************************************************************
good,"I would not recommend working here. Working at Walmart, you are expected to stand and bag groceries for long periods of time. Management frequently forgets to relieve you for your mandatory breaks, and the customers treat you terribly."
good,"Slow and boring, repetitive and predictable. Not much to be desired. Hardest times are around the major holidays, but once they pass go back to being steedy."
good,I worked 3rd shift and switch to second shift not once did any managers ever come up and introduce them self’s to me. I found that very difficult to interact and feel comfortable with my managers I did not appreciate it.
good,"I enjoyed my time here but I feel this place has no room for me to excel. I have been here three years and I didn’t get a chance to receive overtime, when I Demi’s I was punished for it."
good,"As much as I tried to enjoy working for Walmart. It constantly changed and became very stressful to work there. Though I liked my job ,the stress became unbearable and I'd constantly come home with headaches which pretty much led to the stroke I had."
good,"I liked it because I enjoy fixing and repairing things. I got to build my experience with vehicular maintenance with changing batteries, light bulbs, oil and tires. They made me more capable of taking proper care of my own vehicle. Plus it helped me see just how easy all of that is to do."
good,"fast paced, managers always want you to be doing something. you get an unpaid hour lunch and two paid fifteen minute breaks. how much you like your job is usually a direct result of the people working around you."
good,The job was really good and so was the pay but the Management and customers made it harder than it should be. A lot of Assistant Mangers would publically be rude to lower associates.
good,It's not a bad company to work for its thw management that makes it bad. The benefits are good they match your 401k and you buy stock. I dont think I'd recommend it to any one
good,"I didn’t like working here because of the managers. They were very rude, they will make you feel like you not doing your job when you really are. They also lack helping there Associates, even worse they lack talking to there Associates in a respectful way . Can’t get discounts on food anymore"
good,Pay could be better wit current employees instead of bringing new associates makin more than the current  fair is fair ... take care of ur workers an the policy is ridiculous
good,"The company would be a lot better if they paid just a bit more for the work they’re having their associates do, the job could be stressful at times but if as long as everyone is doing what they should be it tends to run pretty smoothly."
good,"All-in-all working for Walmart is hectic, where the pay doesn't quite satisfy. Coworkers are nice, customers can be crazy, and stress at times is through the roof."
good,Walmart need better management. I love to work for Walmart the company is a great place to work once again it's management that need help. I will work there again.
good,"The store manager is awesome!! My management team is awesome. Not enough hours. Sorry, honesty matters. Things change quickly and hours are easily cut. My opinion is the company has forgotten what built us and is forgetting its roots. Sadly, the associates are being left behind for corporate greed."
good,This company was actually a good enviroment to work in. they just dont pay enough. I had a great experience and met alot of good people. Can be harsh at times but it can be worse.
good,"While Walmart will not guarantee you hours, even if you are a full time associate, they still want you to have open availability. I am a full time associate with only set days off and yet I have been scheduled as few as 8 hours in a week."
good,Walmart is a hard place to move up. Requires a lot of who you know and who you get on ur good side to be able to move up within the store other than that. You will have a hard time moving up
good,"A typical day at Walmart is best described as chaotic at best. The amount of work you have to complete is extremely high. No overtime is allowed. Management was understanding, but they could only influence so much. The hardest part of the job was the the impossible workload."
good,Good company to work for has more cons than pros Was happy working there for about eight years then everything changed It’s no longer really a family oriented company it’s more gossip he said she said and favoritism
good,Most of the people I worked with we're good hard working people that just wanted to make a living. But it seemed as though if you were not one of Management's picks you had no chance to advance.
good,"The only reason why I stuck being a fulfillment associate was because of my co-workers. They were really good and made those 8 hrs fun to work. Working with my supervisor and assistant manager was also fun. "
good,"At walmart the employees and managers were very demanding and rude. Everybody was very quiet and all but the only thing good about walmart is the benefits, pay and customer service."
good,"Walmart was an interest company to work for. I like to always be honest in my reviews. That being said, Mixed. I believe they are improving but at a snails crawl on purpose because honestly they don't care and seem to have terrible trouble even pretending to. There getting better. I think!"
good,"Walmart is a fast-paced environment and always busy. No matter what department you're in, there is always something to do. Working as a cashier was very busy with the long lines of customers buying their groceries to fixing any issues we had at the front. If your schedule is free, it's an opportunity to gain extra hours at work and earn more money."
good,"It's an okay job to start with but if you want to advance in the company it's so much hassle. They expect you to be OK with the same pay rate even if you advance positions. They NEVER allow you to make overtime, like it's against the rules. And people there are very nosey and everyone eventually knows all your business. You HAVE to be careful who you talk to working at Walmart!!!!!"
good,Most of the people that work there are really nice an fun to work with. But some of the upper management act like they're better then the other employees which is unprofessional.
good,"Walmart is an ok place to get started and move up as you please. It just had management that would be on you about things that we're not important or critical to the work place. compact, fast, memory (50/50)."
good,Walmart vision center is an ok place to work.I work with a great group of people. We work come as a team and my job is very rewarding. I am looking for something closer to home.
good,"It was very fast paced and I would not recommend this job to middle aged employment seekers. The work is definitely grueling. Personally, the job was not for me."
good,"Great starter job.Can not go into job detail work was confidential."
good,"Good place but are rude there"
good,"Lots of unnecessary drama. Can be a fun place to work. Helping customers find what they are looking for can be very rewarding. Some favoritism. Depending on what shift you are on, you could end up doing your work plus the work of 2 other shifts (this is a work in progress). Some frustration due to people not caring or lack of proper training or both."
good,It was an okay job my co workers were nice management was pretty laid back  I miss it some days others not so much never know I might go back to it again someday
good,"Everyone knew their role, most associates stuck to their role. Those who didn't weren't written up unless they fell below the rate. Managers were awesome but constantly changing. It was all around a good place to work."
good,Has potential to be an easy job but management and customers can make it stressful. Running register is made easy if you have touche screen registers. But you gotta be a people person. Cart associate is preferred because you get a lot of time to your self and it's a relaxed position for the most part till you have to do a carry out or something else then you can fall behind. Also dealing with the weather and bad drivers can vexing but if your not a people person then it's probably the best position for you besides truck unloader.
good,I worked for Walmart roughly 1.5 years it's a company that is different in each store and doesn't always stick too it's own policy if you are a low level employee you will probably be alright and enjoy it to a degree but search around other stores and ask how their atomosphere is before applying some stores are friendly work environments while some are disorderly and tolerate inappropriate behavior and favoritism from stockers all the way to management but overall it can be a good place to work you just have to be prepared for some inequality
good,I really to much didn’t like how the management was they could do better and also treat there employees with respect they lack in that a lot and also hire more employees they lack in that as well.
good,There are only a couple good managers there and the rest are just awful. Attitudes are terrible there and it reflects on the employees. Hours aren’t very flexible and its hard to do things outside of work due to certain hours you may have.
good,"Being an assistant pays well and provides a lot of experience in different situations, both business and people based. However, this position isn't always family friendly. I have worked in environments where the management works together and can create a more positive and productive environment. As more changed happen within the company I have noticed a more competitive and ""everyone for themselves"" type of environment which makes it difficult to create a unified team experience amongst the management and can trickle to the associates. In my experience this creates a lot of people issues  and needs to be handled with a unified front, fairly and consistently and often that is not the case. This often time results in long hours for salaried members of management which makes the job more difficult for people with families at home. "
good,"Began as a Cashier and was promoted to Cashier Supervisor after 5 months."
good,would go  back if under different management also would like to have overtime overall a good company but management was very unorganized but still did my job with a smile and great attitude
good,"The normal work at Wal-Mart consists of helping customers and fellow employees with finding the locations of different items and products. Most of your work will consist of unloading and stocking freight unless you are a cashier or maintenance associate/cart pusher. Friendly environment and easy to get along with your coworkers, but your management will isolate themselves from the hourly employees and assign too much of a workload on them. Management is incompetent at identifying employees who exhibit a low standard of work ethic and applying corrective action. You will be on your feet most of the time, but will receive two fifteen minute breaks and and hour long lunch break depending on the hours you work in a given day. Work is fairly easy, dealing with rude and impatient customers and incompetent managers while you try to work is the hardest part of the job."
good,"Working at Wal-mart is good for someone IF they climb up the promotion ladder. Department Managers make a decent living, and they only have to work the weekends occasionally."
good,It's okay could be better just better need better benefits for employers and managers need a greatly improvements they most of them just don't care and point finger do this do that and they don't really put interest in there work
good,Management was rude and lacked training.  Often you're put into a position with no training.  Good job for someone that needs a little extra income.  Hours are inconsistent.
good,Everything about this distribution Center is fast paced and based on production unless you are in a support position. The time flys and before you know it your shift is over.
good,Had fun working it's a good work place good breaks. I had nice time working for Walmart just wasn't getting paid enough. Plus had problems with a manager but other then that I wish I still worked there
good,Stressful place to work with poor store managers. Always more to be done than time in the day and never any cash registers open anymore so multiple complaints daily with no available fix.
good,"Employees were rude , did not get the proper training that i needed , i wasn't comfortable in my work place , i basically had to learn everything on my own."
good,"I loved working with customers. Stayed busy and moved around a lot job wise. I was a cashier, online grocery pickup associate, dairy stoker, shelf stoker, and helped out all around the store. I enjoyed moving around a lot. Although, sometimes all the managers needed me in different places I managed to sort the work out and get it done. I like to be relied on and show skills."
good,"I was a stocker, some people there suck. Management was nice. Too many hours. I started off working around 20 hours a week, but that quickly changed to 33 hour weeks. That made it really difficult to balance school and my personal life."
good,I loved working in the customer service department but hated the managers. They played favorites and constantly tried to get others doing my job while making me cashier.
good,Worked for the company for more than 15 years. Was not treated fairly. Compensation was not parallel to the workload. Was let go due to abscences due to serious illness.
good,My time there was temporary but it was a high demand in energy and could get very stressful. I was a third shift maintenance at part-time pay. It wasnt all bad it had its ups and downs.
good,"I was very motivated to work with Walmart untill the company started to lower my hours. From a full time employee to a part time job. One good thing I could say about working in this retail business is that you learn to have customer service ability, helping costumers to find what they needed at a good and fair price."
good,"Too stressful. They don't do anything one best way. My manager is an atrocious, pathological liar. She lies so much she can't even keep her lies straight. Management claims they have your back but will toss you to the wolves FAST."
good,"Working for Walmart opened my eyes to what goes on behind closed doors. I learned that a lot of people who have been there don't get promoted and new hires do. A typical day for myself was to come into work, clock in, run register/fill prescriptions, take breaks and lunch and go home. It was clockwork for my job, and very easy. Management was a joke. My manager was great but outside of the pharmacy, you couldn't find a decent manager. The managers were always trying to tell us in the pharmacy (who was a separate entity from the store) that we were going over their hours and what not when we had our own set hours outside of theirs. You couldn't ever find a manager when you needed one and the CSM'S (Customer service managers) were always slow and non-responsive when they were needed back in the pharmacy. There would be times we would wait for 15 minutes before they got back to the pharmacy. Overall, the job was easy but the work-life culture sucked. I dreaded going to work because of the issues with management and if a problem would come up they would drag their feet (unless it was to write you up for a mistake that a CSM made but threw the blame on the employee to cover their butt) and never respond fast enough to a problem. I generally figured out most of the problems myself, with help of my coworkers (if my manager wasn't there)."
good,"I had a good first experience at Walmart as this has been my first every job. However, I have had a few issues with management especially relating to my availability, Other than that, co-workers were friendly and I had a great time working with them"
good,Good workplace with minimal experience necessary. I was able to potentially move up with the company in a management position. I wanted a change so I left the job to go to a different industry.
good,"its not unionized so they get pretty ""flexible""."
good,Not much to say if your thinking of making a career out of the place I'd recommend doing your best an looking out for advancement opportunities. Department managers make a little more than regular employees.
good,"Successful employees require the ability to complete daily routines as well as address unplanned obstacles that come up during the day.  Multitasking and prioritizing are essential.  No matter the position, customer service is required."
good,Es bueno pero pagan poco aparte los turnos rotativos son pesados
good,A job with several bosses. Many of them try to micromanage. Good short term job but bad long term job. The pay is good for what you do. You will have no chance of having weekends or holidays off.
good,One of the things I enjoy most about working for Wal-Mart is it’s diversity. Being able to work with and meet people from all backgrounds. They have a pretty good health care plan but don’t always comply with it as far as not accepting doctors excuse for those physically unable to work due to Haley’s issues. This company does not care for the people by taking away their holiday to be with family and if a loved one passed not showing concern nor sending a simple condolences. It’s impossible for parents to tend to their children based off the New scheduling system they have. In all honesty they need to do a restructure with management starting from corporate on down because this company is no longer concerned with what you know but who you know to get ahead. We’ve loss a lot of great managers who focus was the business and the people behind such. There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to advance this company  Wal-Mart just appreciate those who help to keep it running smoothly!
good,"Working at this place is what you expect. While the tasks are slow and somewhat mundane, the people there are mostly friendly and pleasant to work with. Typically, this job entails assisting the store in unloading merchandise, stocking merchandise, and being available for the customer."
good,I have worked at worse  places but Walmart is not great. The schedule is flexible but they often dont take account into your availability. They expect you to give you soul to the company for $11.50. The ability to advance is there but there is not a lot of opprotunity. The best part about walmart is they support you going to school and learning new skills.
good,There are good store and bad ones the management makes a lot of difference. A negative is they hire warm bodies and won't fire them to others are expected to pick up the slack.  Their restructure of shift has left it to be more difficult on nights moving 3/4 of the crew to other shifts.  Annual evaluations are now just a percent from what you are making I have been with the company for 14 years and still not making $15.00 an hour.
good,"Good management t overall. One, I couldn't take working with anymore."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work while transitioning to something else or wanting a career as a manager. It is not good as a long time employment if you aren't interested in becoming management. But for a first job or something to earn money while in school, Walmart is great."
good,I would go through my day by restocking and organizing the product and filling up the store with items sometimes I would be called by upper management
good,"Very unprofessional place to work. PERIOD. Poor management, unorganized, are not flexible with the work schedule. Horrible place to work HIGH TURNOVER!!!!"
good,It's a job that takes very little skill.  The customers tend to treat cashiers poorly.  It appears that you can work your way up from cashier if you stay and try to advance.
good,My job duties were keeping the store clean! Making sure the bathroom were clean and toilet paper and hand sanitizer was in there. Pulling the trash for inside store and outside store! Making sure the parking lot was clean! Windows and doors clean and front entrance of the store was clean! Bringing cart's back in the buggy area!
good,I really enjoyed myself at Wal Mart. I loved meeting and helping others. I didn’t like managers because they barely even communicated with there employees.
good,"Walmart is a great place to start off and has lots of benefits . Some benefits are 401 K . Stock , and Medical Situations . The break room is a great place to kickback and take a load off on break ."
good,management is the biggest violator of the rules they set for everyone.very bad work ethic from everyone................................................
good,The Walmart that I worked for the managers were overworked and stressed out.  The schedule was not very fair and geared toward only one department supervisor and others got the later shifts.
good,"Good money but a very, tough and stressful job. Once you are topped out no raises whatsoever.  Job is constantly changing and getting harder. The pay is good but you will end up getting more and more work added on every time you show you can handle what you have. Managers are pretty nice but control very little when it comes to the actual job. Co workers are very nice but only a few people stay and it gets hard to have to meet so many new people every week. The attendance system is very unforgiving if you have any sort of emergency or sickness. Four days missed will get you fired. No random drug tests unless you are in an accident."
good,I wouldn’t recommend someone to look at a full time job here because the hours are so inconsistent sometimes and inconsistency doesn’t pay the bills !
good,"Working at Walmart was extremely stressful for me because they would give us tasks with unrealistic time goals, especially if there wasn't enough of us at that shift."
good,"no communication among upper management, distinct divide between salary management and hourly associates, inconsistent enforcement of policy, questionable ethics"
good,I liked working at Walmart good pay most people were nice and fun. But some management has favorites and it will take you forever to move up if your not a favorite even if you can do like everything in your department.
good,"Making sure all 300 employees are productive for the night, that all things needing brought out onto the floor and run up on the shelves, that all trucks are unloaded in a quick fashion, and that all areas have a person covering it!  I learned how to multitask, how to get along and solve problems with People, management was very good and knew what and how to motivate to get things done, the work culture was made to seem like a family, space was the hardest part mostly during the holidays, was When we got awards for getting trucks and merchandise out in hard or impossible times!"
good,Gave me my jump start to improve my skills and develop others along for the advancement.  Not too happy about the job restructures but that is part of business.
good,"It's a good temporary job. One in which you recieve basic training. Customer service is not important to Walmart, it needs to be worked on. Like greeting and being polite to customers."
good,Being a cart pusher teaches you that you either want to stay as a cart pusher or you want to move forward with your life. A typical day in the parking lot is hot and demanding. Management often expects you to do the impossible. You get breaks and lunch but ultimately you're in charge of maintaining a parking lot. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with their groceries.
good,Set up for unloading deliveries trucks; Stock new inventory on shelve; Pull pallets to the floor; Tidy up zones; Assists customers with locating items; Thank the customer for shopping with our organization
good,"You go in, your assigned a task.  After completing task, you are given additional task until the end of the shift.  Communication with other shift associates is discouraged and a strict adherence is maintained for lunches and breaks."
good,"1. Typical day is being able to adapt quickly due to new task completion along with delegation of the tasks and following up. Ensuring that merchandise is unloaded and stocked. Checking for shortages on merchandise especially high dollar amount ones. Investigating potential theft trends and applying security measures. Communicating expectations and mentoring."
good,"A typical day at work was going in and setting up your till you would be working on for the day by longing into it and making sure there was enough money in the cash, making sure the resat paper was full and there were lots of bags for the customers items. the rest of the shift you would just stand there and check customers out as well as bag their items, at the end of the shift you had to log out of the till and make sure it was clean and empty any garbage or hangers that you had collected. The management was very poor while i was working here you would rarely be approved to days off even when asked for way in advance. As well as treated poorly by the management. I believe the hardest part of this job was dealing with rude customers as well as the management. the most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with the customers as well as other employees."
good,"The warehouse is a fast paced, repetitive job, but it’s a simple one. It’s the same thing day in and day out without much change, but it is easy to make an error if you lose focus. Management could be better, the higher the position, the less they care about the person and more about the bottom line. Breaks are short and shifts are long so keep that in mind as well."
good,"While Walmart claims to have an open door policy, they do not really care about removing or reprimanding bad management. Every instance in which my assistant manager had a complaint filed we were told ""deal with it"", ""he's not going anywhere"", ""you just don't like him as a person"", ""if you don't like it quit"". Protecting incompetent management will be one of the problems you will see as an employee. Backstabbing and setting people up for failure are favorite tactics by management as well."
good,very busy store to work in especially during the holidays. there was poor management. had to be reminding supervisors of lunch and breaks. little help from a few supervisors.
good,Everyone is always looking for a promotion and this company gives you the tools to advance. Just be prepared to give your life over to Wal-Mart. The hours make it a little difficult to spend time with family and the minimum wage pay is not enough to support even a low-income living.
good,"Walmart as a sticker is a fast pace work place with constant work to be done , little recognition is given to stockers for the amount of work given and pay is low for amount of work given. Environment is very friendly but management can be good or bad"
good,"i was a cashier/ sales associate in the lawn & garden department, I mainly took care of the plants, i assisted customers.  management made no effort to give me assistance when it was needed most."
good,"It is easy to work here if you are able to learn quickly and follow directions. Management will be hard on you if you are not one of their favorites and cut your hours to let their favorite employees gain more. At some points, it became ridiculous. Other than that, it is a decent job."
good,"wasnt there for long so i cant really say anything , the workers were nice the management didnt really seem to be the nicest of people but thats fine."
good,Walmart management only seems to point out the negative. In my 10+ years with the company i cant recall a single complement from my management team. Everyone is treated like middle school children....treated as if they are lesser people.
good,"Good for students and people who just need a little extra money. How the company functions varies by store. Management lets customers talk to and treat employees however they want for the most part because ""The customer is always right."""
good,"I enjoyed the Assistant managers , but it was always someone coming to visit and had everyone in a panic LOL. They were never prepared and the pay was ok considering the fact I had been off work for a while. Find a focus and stick to it here. Overwhelming!"
good,As a over night stocker we always started out with a mandatory meeting followed by unloading trucks and down stacking freight on to pallets freight was to be sorted by the isle in which it went. after the freight was put on the shelf you would clean your area and make sure the product was facing the right way. I learned from Wal-Mart hpw to assist difficult people how to operate a trash compactor power equipment and a bailer. We had severeal managers that we worked under some was the best people I have ever met while others was not so great. It was more like a group of hard working friends that pulled their weight and got stuff done. the most difficult thing was sometimes they would be unrealistic times to get stuff done. It was all fun I really enjoyed working with the great staff that we had and the customer interactions.
good,It was fun at times working there. Your co-workers are great and willing to help you. It's hard work though. They could stand to pay the employees more. After all they are a super corporation.
good,"I enjoy my job for the most part, my co-workers are great! In the position I'm in now and have been for several years, I'm  looking at other prospects because I'd like to work in another dept. I'm good at my job and management has said the same with good performance reviews each time, but I'd like a new challenge. I've asked when positions come open and my requests fall by the wayside so I feel like I'm going to be in the same position a year or two years from now. Granted, it's hard to find someone for this slot, but holding me back because 'It's my niche"" is unfair. Wouldn't be that way if my previous managers were still here."
good,A typical day is pretty routine. Not much really changes. I learned to use my time wisely on slow or busy days. The most enjoyable part of the job where the employees I got to know and the quarterly bonuses.
good,job consisted of receiving product in and helping customers out. Company was ok to work for as long as you fine doing your job. Discounts were nice a round holidays
good,I have done many things in my career and have gone up and down the ladder of opportunities. There is no shortage of changes that come with a retail job. Work/Life balance used to be great but has slowly gone to the wayside.
good,Depending on the people you work with you can either get along with them or not. Most of the managers are really strict and always ask you to do things your job doesn’t entitle you to do.
good,It was good for what I needed at the time.  More benefits than I realized were offered.  It had flexible hours which was nice with early morning available.
good,Stressful and overworked. As a cart pusher you are constantly working and different weather conditions. Some manager act like they don't care about the employees.
good,"While working here, you don't even really see the managers, as the supervisors report all information upwards. My supervisor kept yelling at us to go faster unloading the trucks until I pointed out she was misreading the paper on the wall listing our quotas. When it became clear we were getting the trucks done 45 minutes early, she stopped breathing down our necks and tore down the quota papers. The workplace became much more tolerable after that."
good,"Walmart provided adequate technician staffing for patient safety.  They also allow for pharmacist overlap so that CBL,s and immunizations could be done."
good,Daily scan and stock merchandise to maintain proper inventory levels.Inspect merchandise after rollbacks and markdowns to ensure it is correctly priced and signed. Listen to and help customers to provide the best service available
good,Empresa capaz de proporcionar um plano de carreira.
good,"Operating cnc machine, making both aluminum and steel parts for suv and pickups. Machine and gauge parts for quality then prepare for shipping. Take pallets to shipping area"
good,Most of managment was hired outside the company so you ended up knowing more than your manger. They were no help at all. Too much of a workload on associate and management
good,I didn't like working there so I went some where else the management there sucked so did hr seemed like they didn't want to here ur concerns really poor management
good,It’s really not worth it. I was a cashier an the hours are unbelievably bad. Some weeks I get maybe 30 some weeks I get 11... mangers are alright. Could use better.
good,"The 4yrs at Wal-Mart were enjoyable. Flexible working hours while in school. The management were upstanding during times of need. There was also opportunities to transfer departments and they opened up. Working customer service and loss prevention, I was able encounter all customer service aspects."
good,"take product off the semi trucks , down stack product to carts , take product to the correct place in the stock , stock product on the shelves , ineract with customers"
good,"Employment status was challenged frequently by Store Manager."
good,"For those seeking to work for Walmart, it is an experience like no other. In order to work for this company you must be prepared and disciplined because the environment of this work place can be stressful and challenging. In order for Walmart to consider you a full time employee you must complete there mandatory 90 day program and online assessments. Just because you applied for one area does not mean that they won't change you to a different station."
good,"A typical day at Walmart was to clock in and to start work. Going out to the sales floor and helping in your department. I learned how to manage customers on every level. The hardest part of Walmart was the customer, when you tell them what is going on and they wont accept it.The only great part about Walmart is my friends and the rare nice customer."
good,The cashier's are a team. They were a fun group to be involved with. Other than that it was just a corporate job. For the most part the customers knew that as well.
good,"It is an okay place to work if you have an assigned job criteria. However, management tends to expect you to do your role and another associate's role if they are absent, even if you have never performed that duty before and expects it to be done timely and efficiently. Very unrealistic expectations."
good,Most managers are poor and most the people that you worked with wined alot there are good people there though if you have a good skin you could survive.
good,For most people working at Walmart they didn't encounter the issues I had with them. I was pretty much the youngest person working in my position at 18 so they used me in a lot more ways than everyone else. I got hired for the CAP 1 position which is where you basically stock the regular dry foods such as canned foods and chips and mac and cheese. My issue was that I was seen as an opportunity for Walmart to completely get rid of the position of overnight stocking of the frozen foods which were paid about $14 an hour for the job yet I was only making $11. They pretty much put me by myself every day only stocking frozen foods directly in the middle of the day which was definitely not what I applied for nor got hired for so I was pretty confused at first. They had told me that they would be switching everyone around from day to day throughout all of the cap 1 associates which clearly they did not do except for maybe once or twice. So I got hired for one job then got placed in a completely different job being underpaid for that job for about 5 months. Then I decided enough was enough and couldn't do the job anymore if they couldn't pay me properly for the position or let me do my actual job.
good,"not the best place to work. I was there for 7 years and I was cross trained in multiple departments that I was expected to cover on my own every shift, while running layaway and site to store."
good,Not happy anymore  working here. Not willing to work with you when you get ready to retire/ What I learned was it doesn`t matter how hard you work or being dependable. Or to learn more about your job that it goes unnoticed. In my retirement I want to work someplace that you feel appreciated and not to be taken for granted
good,"Time off i very strict.  Poor attitude and  no communication,  No Team atmosphere.  Everyone out for themselves and the Associates are not listen to.  A typical day is mass confusion and you are not given the time to work in your own aree,"
good,"Being a cashier was not a difficult job, but it wasn't something I wanted to do for too long.  Being in Walmart, there were a ton of customers, so the job was very busy and fast-paced"
good,"bad associate to customer ratio, management is very reasonable. The hardest part of this job is finding the correct associate in a specific department for help."
good,I loved working overnight and having my day free to take care of everything that I needed to. I liked that I was in the same area every night and I knew where everything was.
good,"This job can be stressful at times."
good,Started as a great place. Slowly turning into having no work/life balance with longer hours and less weekend time off. Higher level management out of touch with actual store running
good,"They treat you like you are dumb. Over work you and tell you to figure it out. Also, favoritism prevails when it comes to moving up. Over worked to the max. They hold coachings over your head."
good,Walmart is a well known crazy town. Depends on who is running/in charge of all of it. Promotion comes with taking the blame for everything that isn't your fault.
good,sometimes it got a little hard and crazy to keep up with getting all of the returned items from customer service and put them back out on sales floor.
good,"A typical day as a meat wall stocker i came into my work area and cleaned up all of the meat racks and the work area to keep it safe for storing of food.. take all expired food off of the store floor, stock the meat etc. from the fridge and freezer on to the sells floor and organize the bins that contain those food products.. Pull the truck of new stock that comes in then organize that new stock in the freezer and refrigerator unless there are empty spaces on the sales floor.. Very face paced work environment without much help but you get use to it after working for a prolonged period of time.. all stocking is timed and must be recording by punching tasks which equates to you doing a box per minute to meet or exceed the task time"
good,Overall i did not feel good about working at walmart due to the poor management although the pay was well. I feel like the job as a whole was a help in gaining work experience.
good,"Tough to work here if you have physical limitations, very little is done to accommodate you.  Rules change often and information is not relayed well. You are replaceable, there are more people where you came from."
good,It was a nice place to work nice people and clean. I was sick alot in the short time i was there so unfortunately i had to resign from the job but overall a nice place to work
good,"Ambiente adorável , só umas pessoas que não são humildes mais nada que não resolvemos na conversa tudo super desdicados e prestativeis ."
good,typical work day can be relaxed or stressful all days are different. most enjoyable part is the coworkers everyone is friendly. management has favorites so that can get difficult when wanting to advance.
good,"The work atmosphere is real fast paced and slow paced depending on the day, season, or holiday. I don't like that the chain of command lets managers from other departments can give you instructions without clearing it with your current manager."
good,"WalMart could be a good place to work if they didn't expect 10 people to do the work of 30. "
good,"Lots of Customer interaction, Lots of stocking and inventory, Maintaining a clean and friendly atmosphere. And Have to have good Customer Service and help Customers to find their every day needs.."
good,When I first started at Walmart I love to work in there about as time went by hours for starting to drop and management completely changed at times they wanted us to go to departments and do jobs that we wasn't a sign for a we barely even knew about
good,"Walmart was the first job I worked for, right out of high school. I did learn how to communicate with customers and to help appease their needs, however, I would not work there again."
good,"Working as an apparel associate was ok, it was the customers that either made my day good or ruined my day. I liked management, they communicated effectively with each department and made the effort to advance and let us grow as a team. I did more than just be an apparel associate as they needed more people to take on other roles and fill in spots like cashiering or working in other departments. I didn’t like the nitpicking when it came to making everything look “perfect” but we tried our best to make the store look really good. Overall really nice place for a first time job. Wouldn’t stay forever though."
good,I personally didn’t like working here due to how I was treated by management as well as customers. Main priority is to make them happy.  Being a cashier always keeps you busy.
good,It’s a good place to work if you are a student or a parent looking for part time work. They work with you on your schedule. Management was very poor. Didn’t care about cleanliness
good,"At first working at Walmart as a cashier was great for me. Nice people, cut me a lot of slack, rewards for reaching goals, patient when you're still learning. However, after 6 months as a cashier, I feel as though I've been critiqued and nitpicked for every little thing, sometimes even for things I've never done. I've been accused of continuously being late (I've been late once because of a misunderstanding on my part)  and missing shifts (I've missed three shifts due to being sick but I always notified them at least a day before) as well as lacking initiative. I don't want to rant on but at this point I'm just waiting to get a different job then I'm out."
good,Average work place not very caring but on the good hand great pay and benefits with PTO and stock plans. Upper management needs works feels loose and uncaring overall.
good,"Working at Walmart in an entry level position is simple enough, and the training both computer-based and personal is usually sufficient for almost anyone to handle the job. However, training for managerial level positions is often entrusted wholly to other managers who have no investment or interest in another employee's success, and are not given the time to properly train another employee by upper management."
good,A typical day at work was very busy. I handled customers all day everyday. I learned how to properly communicate with rude or impatient customers. The management didn't always do their job correctly. I felt as though they were giving other employees opportunities that weren't given to me. Anytime I requested time off it would never get approved. The hardest part of the job would have to be when there is a rush. You have to be fast but also be aware of customers and make sure that every item is accounted for. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to create relationships with the employees there.
good,"Very long hours at times sometimes upwards of 60 hour work weeks, management could be harsh at times. I learned how to be a team leader I learned a lot about finances. I enjoyed meeting new people and helping members of my team."
good,"department managers disappear all the time. friendly store manager but not strict enough. overall the job is easy, its just stressful at times. I've have always worked retail and worked for Walmart and sams club. the policies are different and people are just numbers to this store."
good,"Creo que la empresa no necesita mucha presentación, así que me voy a ahorrar el capitulo preliminar que normalmente suelo incluir en los análisis de revisión de la empresa, por dar algún dato hablamos de la empresa de consumo más grande del mundo, con más de 11.400 tiendas distribuidas a lo largo y ancho de la geografía."
good,"The job is decent when you need a place to work, but over time it can be stressful due to lack of advancement opportunities and the pay not raising over time."
good,I didn't like my job because management and the people I worked with didn't trust me enough to do my job. They were afraid I was going to mess up. The fear of having the expectation of doing my job kept me from doing my best. The employees don't work together. A new employees do the work of many. Management don't' seem to care about employees working together. It was the more miserable experience in my life.
good,"While I was there, I was very happy just to have a job. There were a few negatives: expected to push customers who made it very clear they were not interested in applying for a credit card. Overall it was a good experience. A lot of nice people and managers."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work .I been with Walmart for a year helping customers, writing up cars , being a cashier, and alot of restocking.The best part i love about walmart is being ah cashier because you get to meet the new customers and have ah conversation of hoe they day is going and ask them did they find everything they were looking for me."
good,although i did enjoy the culture and environment and working at wal-mart it was a low paying company/position . if the pay were better i could have stuck with them long term . there was much opportunity to advance and had the pay been better i would have been able to stay with them long enough to move into larger roles and better paying positions. i think they could benefit a lot by offering more to their employees as incentive to stay long term .
good,"The environment was more or less tolerable, but the management was very biased & unprofessional with hour scheduling. "
good,"I worked at night with a crew that handled the store when there was no customers. we handled the trucks, major stock and we got to have fun. It is a different place at night, more alive, the staff seem depressed during the day."
good,It's not a bad place to work just wish the pay was better and benefits where better bosses are nice and understanding for the most part just wish the pay was more
good,"Walmart pays well, usually provides decent hours, and has memorable employees. Although, it's managers are ridiculous, they change the goals set for positions often, and aren't very reasonable when it comes to conflict. Also, the schedules change very frequently."
good,"A typical day as a supervisor was stress all day long.  We were almost always short staffed and our manager,  and sometimes our assistants, would set unrealistic time frames for things, causing a lot of friction. Our manager was the type that is never wrong. Many of our employees called her mean and a bully, making people angry or cry by screaming at them and so on. I personally never had any issues and liked her. It's just that it made for a ""nothing I do matters, so what's the point, hostile type environment at any given time with any given people."
good,"Throughout my time at Walmart, I can truthfully say that the main reason that I do not enjoy working there is the managers. They do not commend employees for a job well done, and only scrutinize them for when they fail. Managers of other departments will give employees tasks that have no relation to their job description. (Ex. Asking a produce employee to unload a truck). They make working at Walmart unpleasant."
good,"Walmart used to be a great place to work, they started implementing new rules on sick days and time off, they got away from caring about the associate and more about the money."
good,Working at walmart DC you had to bring your A game every single day and had to stay mentally alert at all times. One mistake could cost you your job. High attrition rates simply due to people looking to make easy money and thats simply not the case at Walmart DC.
good,Not the best company to work for if you have a degree. Is not that easy to move up and they expect you to do work without the proper tools. Is not a job to make a career out of it.
good,Walmart gives you the opportunity to move up in the company  its fast paced work  customer satisfaction is number one priority for working at Walmart.
good,"Could be good or bad, depends on management and coworkers. I enjoyed working in the auto bay as long as they did not try to pull us for all the other positions in the store."
good,Buen lugar para trabajar depende mucho los encargados de departamento
good,not enough workers in a department to finish the jobs. too many duities for the amount of people they have schedualed. stressful on the staff.Managment never helps.
good,Walmart’s managers are a big part of the problem with Walmart. It reminded me like I was in high school. They had people go sit and wait at the office like a kid. Your supervisors would tell you to do something and then you would get in trouble by other management for doing it. Poor communication.
good,Management sucks there. They got many new managers that just started working and doesn’t know completely how to run their departments. Nor do they understand how to communicate with their associates.
good,"Been working for Walmart for over 3 years. Managed to meet the expected work ethic standards, and managed to balance work and study at the same time.."
good,So short staffed At the Walmart I worked at. Thier attendance systems are flawed because of lack of proper regulation on issues with employees. Instead of trying to  proactivly Solve attendance issues. They decide to only tighten thier grip and limit it even further.
good,"It's the best retail company you could work for, as far as the skills you learn and benefits you get as a full time associate. Most of the issues I've experienced are with short staffing and bad management.Overall, I'm thankful to have been promoted to a management roll and continually develop my communication and problem solving skills each day."
good,Working at the service desk you need to be calm and able to work quickly. Lines will line up around the corner at times when you are the only one working and you just need to be able to stay calm.
good,"For the most part Walmart was a decent place to work.  The only downside was the management, with unrealistic expectations and refusing to take responsibility for their mistakes. But if you can work fast and follow directions, it shouldn't be too bad."
good,"The employees were non-productive.  Low motivation.  Difficult to work well."
good,they are constantly checking up on you expecting you to finish in a little time. They do not give you the chance to request days off and the pay is never stable.
good,"Customers were great to work with and around, I want to advance higher in the company and it seemed forever before I even received a chance.  Management was always in the offices never on sales floor or watching associates."
good,depending on the time of year it is slow but if its around the holidays it gets super busy. the management system at Walmart is terrible as they don't listen to their employees and schedule you outside of your availability.
good,"Have to move fast in paced, patients like to be help immediately, not enough hours, could not go past over time. Also the management expects you to help departments that are not yours."
good,"The is fun if you make it fun, i learnt a lot about handling money and customer service. The hardest part about the job is trying to sell the master cards to customers. The most fun part is meeting new people."
good,The only problem I had with Walmart was the way that management never gave praise only had problems.The culture was slightly toxic in that people always talked about other employees and sometimes Management would be involved in those conversations. If it were not for these things I would not have left Walmart and would still be working there
good,not a whole lot to expect. Management and company policy can be the biggest hindrance to job satisfaction. people are the best part. hardest part can be some of the general labor especially back room associates.
good,"Unorganized with no game plan. I worked with what I could , very hard worker and open minded in regards to tasks and duties. Despite the poor management , I managed to get things done correctly at a timely manner ."
good,"There is always something to do. Like helping customers with their carryouts, pushing carts from parking lot to the garage, and picking up trash in parking lot if there is nothing else to do."
good,"Aside from very poor management, Walmart is a wonderful place to work. I love the people i work with as well as most of the people I come in contact with every day. As a cashier I keep my work area clean and my customers happy. While working at Walmart I have learned how to multitask and how to quickly accomplish my assigned task. The most enjoyable part of my job is definitely my customers. I love having people to talk to and laugh with all day!"
good,Good Pay and good benefits 40 hour work week on average but depending on where u work its till completion so the hours can vary. enjoyed the teamwork and people. Its a very high paced production based job and can very physically demanding. High Turn Over rate Perfect entry job out of High School
good,"I myself believe it takes way too many years to move up at Walmart.  The overall employees were great people, and i've seen worse management. The point system for being late or missing a day etc. is unforgiving so make sure you're ON TIME."
good,Not much room for advancement because management had set positions and not much good interaction with its employees I do believe it a great job to start as a teen to pay for school and things of that sort but not a place if you want to advance in
good,"my day consist of cleaning,a lot of walking and lifting,opening boxes and taking care of plants,management be there but they have there picks,working with the associates is like working with family and the hardest part if the job is walking and beening on your feet because its huge."
good,a typical day at work can vary based on your postion. most positions will require you to know your job within a few weeks and then you'll be thrown into OTJ training with little assistance from supervisors (again depending on your position). If your lucky to have a manager(s) that is organized you will have a decent exprience. Also expect to constantly assist or takeover department duties in another department when they are short-staffed even if your the only one in your assigned department. Your coworkers are usuaully the best part of working at walmart it really feels like a big family. If you communicate with your supervisors and managers about your schedule they most likely will accomodate and work with you.
good,"I would make sure that merchandise is neat and organized. I am able to use Multi line phone, Computer knowledge, customer service, knowledgeable about products, money orders and money transactions."
good,My over all I had good and bad days the upper management needed to pick up there game they only care about you when it’s beneficial but I love the people I worked with
good,Would like to have learned other departments . Help out in other areas that needed help when shirt staffed. Love learning new things n how to make customers happy.
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart for the months I was there. I felt the fact that I did not get enough hours was not for me to stay and that was a reason for me to leave along with some personal issues.
good,"I loved the people I worked with and the money I was making, but their attendance policy just sucked. Over all it’s a great place to work as long as you are working with the right people."
good,They didn't distinguish a good employee hard worker with interest of succeed on his/her career. People who worked hard use to get more work and people who didn't worked so hard they where disregard and his/her poor performance was never a problem to take care of.
good,Pay and benefits all good. You are expected to work as many hours as needed to get the job done but the job is never done. I left because they wanted me to transfer again and I just didn't want to move to again.
good,"if you need a job go to walmart, they hire anyone. If you do more than expected you will just be asked to do more. Keep to yourself and do the bare minimum there is always drama there and its safer to just stay out of all of it. Just clock in, work, and then clock out."
good,"Its a good working environment, you just have to go there and do your job and dont listen to anyones that work there some of them are horrible to you will try to make u feel like your at the bottom and they are the big guns"
good,The company provide good policy and benefits Anyway depend on whom manage and assign the job. Some how if management have no skill and lace of experience then make it worst.
good,"It’s a fast paced store being that it’s pretty small in size but averages about $300,000 in sales. The employees are pretty friendly and support each other."
good,Worked for Walmart for fifteen years. High opportunity for advancement and overall good culture. Pay is also adequate but comes with a low work life balance.
good,I have worked in many areas at Walmart and they were all about getting product out and attending to the customers needs and wants.  You also have to learn to work with many different people with different back grounds and beliefs to full your duties.
good,Just like any other big retailer you have the good and bad. The good was amazing when it was bad is wasnt easy to get through the long night shifts.but overall It a fairly good place to work.
good,I'm highly grateful to have been able to excel with the company over the years. Direct management could stand to perform better with leadership skills.
good,"Everyone is pretty relaxed. However, Management can be overwhelming. They tend to ask a lot of you but are unorganized and ever-changing.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with upset/impatient customers."
good,"There was no more  benefits as at the time I left,no holiday pay and there was no overtime pay at all. As at the time I was there,their overnight manager was so biased"
good,this job was relatively routine and was easy to fallow. the people that I worked with for the most part wanted to do a good job and was motivated to do there best of the situation they were given. I liked it.
good,"Most of the answers to these questions vary. I'd recommend certain stores maybe to other people, but I have had my share of experience working at a store with horrible managers. In general, things are at the managers discretion. As for PTO, you earn a certain amount depending on how many hours you work. Different positions suck more than others, depends on your forte."
good,"When I first started with Walmart it was a company that challenged me to better and further myself for advancement with my career which I did. In 6 years I was promoted 3 times with a starting salary of $23,400 and a ending salary of $50,000. The company went through many changes in 2016 through 2018. The new changes put me in a position to do my job along with other mangers jobs with no opportunity for advancement. I then heard that they would possibly be doing away with my possion so I decided to seek out other opportunities."
good,Wal-Mart is a fast paced work place that keeps workers busy most of the time and rarley had accidents on store site and it also has a fair amount of customers who shop walmart stores
good,I did not like working here very much. They had me working 2 different departments at one time and only got paid for the one. Which at walmart every department has a different pay range.
good,it was a stepping stone for me.  The people and staff were kind I have no complaints.I was an associate in the fashion department.  Many thimes I was called up to help out the cashiers I liked it.
good,Working there was stressful at times for different reasons. Dept. mgrs. were not effective enough to achieve maximum departmental goals. The dept mgr. would sometimes act in a manner not conducive for proper employee relations.
good,"I loved working at Walmart. I loved all my coworkers and the breaks are mandatory. I didn’t like how They do not want to give you any benefits. I worked full time but thy would never hire me in as full time, so they could avoid giving me health coverage and vacation days. The job was great, my manager was great,  but the overall company is questionable."
good,Mett some great people there. Learned about merchandising and customer service from some good teachers. Was hard trying to find people that wanted to do a little extra to make the work area better.
good,I've worked for Walmart for 8 months and a typical day working with us is mostly a good and fast day at work due to the rate in which we are working you tend not to notice how time passes.
good,This job was very stressful at times and they don’t like to work with you on the days you put in to be off. They don’t like to work with you when you need to change your hours.
good,"WalMart is a mixed bag.  Management was paid fair, but asked to work ridiculous hours, and nothing was ever done good enough so raises were hard to get.  Hourly associates aren't paid well at the entry level, but those positions are intended for those without a tertiary education.  The problem is that the individuals applying for those positions expect to make enough money to support a family and that is just not how it works.  Corporate WalMart is clueless to the local culture and customs, yet they don't let middle management own their work; you have to do it the corporate way..."
good,"This was my first job. When I started in September of 2017 the managers and everyone were nice and helpful. My job was to spend the entire shift picking up clothes from the floor, putting the ones customers returned away, and fixing all the clothes in the area(s). By the end of 2018,the had switched the managers and the new apparel manager didn't know what they were doing. One person was expected to do the jobs of 2 or 3, and we were highly understaffed."
good,Working as a cart pusher at Walmart made me get use to it and it got easy each day ahead and I had co workers who were great at what they do so I give Walmart a great rating
good,"Working at Walmart can be very stressful, although training is given it is minimal, most training is on the job. A typical day will include working in the backroom prepping product for the sales floor. Running the front end is very challenging but also very rewarding."
good,"As a cashier at Wal-Mart I was directly in contact with the customers. A typical day involved me standing at the register scanning goods, handling monies, and helping customers as needed."
good,The time that I spent there was interesting to say the least. Its is a fast paced work place. You do get benefits if you do stay around. Probably not for everyone but if it your first job give it a try.
good,impersonal management .  Fast paced work that is rewarding and challenging.  flexible hours Not helpful with medical situations but friendly employees
good,Was able to start back part-time. Allowed me to come into work at a later time and work only 4 or 5 hours a day. Supervisors showed me what to do. when I had a question they helped me.
good,"I enjoyed interacting with the customers and the employees that I managed. There is no set schedule, so it is difficult to consistently volunteer or join clubs in the community."
good,Empresa lider en el autoservicio con un buen ambiente de trabajo
good,Walmart was my first job out of high school. My work days there were often stressful and back breaking work as a unloader. Management was always pulling myself or some of our other coworkers from our daily duties due to short staff. One of the hardest things was trying to unload 2 full trucks before lunch with only about 3-4 people. The most enjoyable time was the people I started to connect with. Without befriending one of them I would have never went off to my next career path.
good,"Being an employee at neighborhood walmart was somewhat stressful  at times because the atmosphere of the workplace. Employees had drama between each other; and customers could be difficult to interact with. However, the management was sufficiently supportive and encouraging. The hardest task as a self checkout host was dealing with upset customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing regular customers, and forming friendly relationships with them over time."
good,constant work flow to keep you busy. wide variety of jobs . not very well management skills . good scheduling and hours. good organizational setups made for a quicker pace to get your tasks done
good,gets work done and there able to help the costumers to the max of there ability's. They have semi flexible hours and they have a point system that keeps people from laving work.
good,"Honestly, it wasn't a job that I intended on keeping. I did enjoy working there for the most part just because of the fellow cashiers that I got to know."
good,"While working for Walmart, I was vocal in asking for opportunities to grow within the company. Not only was I vocal, it was shown in my work, attention to detail and attendance. They would promise and promise but each instance would always end being someone recruited externally or someone promoted strictly from tenure."
good,show up put customers through the system and change oil and do tires sometimes your by yourself cause they could never keep employers enjoyable was break  cause i wasnt woking
good,Always was ready for a day there setting up unload floor to unload are GM truck to set up for use and overnights to stock.. i learned how to run a crew and how to be a better team member and leader for my crew got to know a lot of people and started to have a good crew with me didn't have people coming and going so i didn't have to train new every other week it was really good.  Got to learn how my crew ran and had them learning all parts of the store so i had back up for call ins.  workplace culture was always something different and lots of different people..  The hardest part of my job was not knowing how was all going to be there for the night tell i had my workers come in and i would know but i was always able to get it done by the end of the night and with not many people there but i worked just as hard as my crew and even harder had to just so my guys and crew could have left by the end of the night on time.  the most enjoyable part of my jobs was the crew i grow lots of respect from them and grow a working retaliation with the crew. and a good working crew that all worked together and learned together we where a team...
good,"Walmart is a great place to work for school and work balance. I recommend working there as a first job to understand a work field. Yet honestly, each store has different people, costumers, and (most importantly) management, so each store's atmosphere/culture varies."
good,"Wal-Mart is not an equal opportunity employer as advertised"
good,"I was a stoker, my main job was to unload trucks and stock shelf's helping customers find what they were seeking. I learned many things and most were beneficial, i hope to use them in the future. the hardest part about the job was management i had seen many cases of sexual harassment and racial commits to myself and coworkers go unnoticed, even after calling corporate offices."
good,walmart has alotta of all around work and sometimes it can b stressful but you just have to stay focused and make sure the job gets done. i enjoyed working there.
good,It was ok the managers was very racists i didmt like the fact they had favoritism towards certian works based on their race it was a good learning experience
good,Somedays it's easy other days harder..usually never the same thing as the last day except daily  Routines..walmart is a good company at times bonus are usually nice
good,"No one cared about the store, job they were assigned, or fellow employees. Everyone was always in a bad mood about something and never wanted to pitch in to help. They would preach about career advancement opportunity, but when I would train associates and teach them new things they would get in trouble. Many ethics violations also occurred in my time there and absolutely nothing was ever done about it. Management  was unwilling to work with scheduals when people had lives outside of Walmart (kids, and other dependents)."
good,Their criminal background check only goes back 5 year now.  This makes it easier to get a job if you have older criminal history that would have kept our out of the running before.
good,Walmart is fast paced for supervisors and certain job roles but may be slower for regular sales associates. Working at Walmart ensures that you will have a stable job as long as you are willing to shop up and work within reasonable expectation.
good,"A job is what you make. I personally enjoyed working with all the new customers. This job is not ideal for anybody who wants to afford to live though. They only give few people full-time postilions. The pay has improved but without a full time position, there are no benefits or overtime. The hours are inconsistent; working you four hours in the afternoon or four hours in the morning. These shifts make the drive barely worth it with the way gas prices are. Sometimes you will be given an 8 hour shift but more times than not, it will on be four or six."
good,Some Managers was not very nice. Always had an attitude. Always had something smart to say. Never noticed my hard work but noticed everyone else. Mainly had me working by myself and others together. I managed to stay focused  and get everything done in a short period of time. Managers always sent me to lunch 2 hours after my scheduled lunch break. Some workers had attitudes towards me. Some helped me out when I needed help. I always helped others out no matter what the situation was.
good,Working in inventory management cap team 2 is responsible for stocking all consumeable freight so the customers can buy what they need when they shop in the store so our sales stay at the highest percentage and keep customers satisfied and coming back to shop.
good,Poor management unknown if you were to have a long time working for  them if you were not in the click click your time was limited a place of who you know not what you know
good,Management is all over the place. Customers are either nice or not so nice. Fellow co-workers are nice. Hardest part is dealing with customers that are set on complaining and raging no matter who they are speaking with. Most enjoyable part is actually being thanked for helping someone. I have learned that no matter what keep a smile on and be conscious of what you say.
good,"So this job is one with more cons than pros. First off the Management is poor at best. From my experience they are known for promises of good pay raises which turn out to be 30 cents a year, There benefits are not that great meaning you still pay a lot out of pocket for doctors appointments, prescriptions and what not anyways, They start you out with pay that would no way be able to keep you a float and there is no such thing as career advancement unless you are ""buddy buddy"" with the manager. The only thing i had to look forward to when i was employed was: the co-workers who were not favored by the managers were nice to talk to and always willing to help if needed, they do offer a discount card although its a poor pay raise you are still guaranteed a pay raise every year."
good,"It was a good job provided you aren't sick, don't mind drama, & don't mind lower wages.  They take Dr's notes but it's still counted against you.  They often scheduled me so they'd only have to give me one break. Meaning instead of scheduling me for 6 hours with two breaks, they would schedule me for 5.5 hours with only one break. So, in my opinion they are taking advantage of people."
good,Walmart is a very fun workplace but the management is not the best! If management was better Walmart would be a very good place to work! The co-workers are amazing.
good,"Not a bad place to start out at. Not a place to make as career..People friendly enough (management and fellow employees)"
good,It is a very hectic and stressful and unappreciated company. I use to enjoy working there but it has changed over the years. Just  seems like they put more on us than we  can handle
good,"A typical day at work can combine cart pushing with maintenance.  Management does not welcome creativity nor innovation...even if it would become a potential ""goldmine of opportunity.""  The hardest part of my job is to be overwhelmed by customers and their shopping and have to play catch up.  Keeping up is a lot easier and less stressful.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the ""nice people"" that shop where I work.  We already have enough of not so nice customers who--flat out--make my hard job even harder to do."
good,There are many different types of people in this world if you want to work here you better be ready to be as friendly as possible and dont take things personal leave your work at work enjoy yourself make it a happy place for you to be to keep a positive healthy attitude
good,I enjoyed most of my bosses at Walmart.  There was opportunity for advancement if you were willing to politic.  A lot of times it seemed to be the people who sucked up to management and took credit for others' work who advanced.  The pay was horrendous.  I couldn't afford to live without a roommate after 12 years with the company.  Only getting one weekend off per month makes your social/family life difficult.
good,"Great environment but i feel the automotive manager favors certain people and they are constantly getting the better schedule and hours. I have worked the longest here and still feel alot of newbies take advantage of this. I am part time and cannot get full-time no matter how hard i try. Part time does not offer benefits for me and my spouse,  my hours have been cut to 16 because i heard its the time managers get their raise so they cut off everyones hours to get the bigger payout. I have to consider another job in order to pay for living."
good,"it was a great place to work. they are great with hours, managment though is hard to work with. authority often comes from co workers. i left cuz i got hurt and they wouldnt accomodate me ."
good,"fast paced and requires a friendly disposition, must be able to multi task and get along with co-workers while maintaining job requirements and keeping customers happy."
good,Good first job  or early career job.  An environment where you can acquire many  skills that are transferable.  A large number of departments to cross train in.  Fair health insurance and benefits package.  Assistance with employee tuition reimbursement.
good,"The Walmart culture says its about diversity, teamwork, and customer service....That's a good thing but most managers are so stressed out that it rubs off on the associates. They don't make it a fun place to work because they are not enjoying the responsibilities that are bestowed upon them. Very stressful to work at times and hard to approach management with questions, concerns, or comments from the associates. Also, hard to get enough hours to work to make a decent bi-weekly check."
good,Walmart offered better pay than alternative jobs and offered for a more competitive workplace. I would have enjoyed staying here longer had I not been a temporary employee.
good,"- not bad if you stay away from the drama.      "
good,They need some work in the area comunication area as well as some classes about mental health awarness in the workplace and how to handle and comunicate with mental health related employees.other than that its a decent place to grow and expand your education
good,Walmart has been a job with many learning experiences. The job would be so much better if they actually put the hard workers they have into the right positions.
good,"The work environment is tolerable if you can handle the workload given to you, but upper management has unreasonable expectations, and will take it out on you."
good,"Fast paced work, a lot of times understaffed, especially on the front end. Other employees were enjoyable to work with, management was ok for the most part."
good,I hated that none of the managers knew what they were talking about only a few did but you didn’t have structure and it was so disorganized it really gets frustrating
good,Workers here tend to get too involved in personal life and bring drama to the workplace. Overall the workplace is 4 stars due to the flow of work and recommend for first time work.
good,"Don't particularly have fond memories working here because I was a night-shift employee which wasn't for me, nothing against the company they take care of their employees."
good,It was fun but during the holiday season it's a lot of work and stress. I had to come in early which was okay I guess. I also made some mistakes that every person makes from time to time.
good,It was a good place to work. I had a supervisor that was also yelling and complaining about everything that was done. She never showed any type of happiness when we did what was asked.
good,The normal work day does not allow you to deep dive into asset protection side of the job any more now that we are split as ap and assistant managers.
good,"I was targeted and harassed by my immediate supervisor and one of the support managers to the point where I finally told my doctor that I wanted to kill myself. My day started out in the back room and we immediately started unloading the truck. Because Walmart loves to hire teenagers, you have to deal with low work ethic and stupidity all day long. The stakes are always being raised and the rules are always being changed. Different managers would tell me different things that conflicted with each other, leaving me confused and sometimes in trouble."
good,I think the store was okay along with some of my co workers. But management was very bad and would often trip over their words and make doing the job much harder than it should be.
good,"There were ever enough people to go around, we were always understaffed and overworked. The corporate office seems completely out of touch with the store level. All levels of the store had too much on their plate"
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for. You would need to make sure that you are very flexible and always have someone on standby for children, if you have any."
good,"Typical day at work involved cleaning the aisles, and then stocking shelves. I've learned that this work isn't work I'd like to do for a long time, but the workplace of the culture was well-paced and fun, with management that was flexible provided work was done. The hardest part of the job was balancing my school work along with another job, but what kept me coming back was the bonds I made, and the relatively easy work."
good,"Management is not bad, some days more stressful than others. "
good,"Walmart is all about their customers to bring a fast, friendly, clean place to shop. "
good,job was easy i work in deli so i  cook make sure food was always freash.meat and cheese slicer was always clean for the next slice.everything in my area was stock and was not out of date.this job was only hard when we was short of staff or others did not show up for work
good,"When I first started at my specific store, I was a general salesfloor associate who's primary task was unloading trucks and stocking freight. Through hard work, and good work attitude and ethic, I quickly was promoted to a Department Manager after just six months. After 4 more months, I applied for, and got a promotion to the GM Support Manager. For the most part I enjoyed my time working there, but my specific store had glaring issues concerning the Salaried Members of Management."
good,"My assistant manager was a bully at the location I worked for. If it weren’t for her, and the fact that I was being overworked I would have stayed. The job itself wasn’t terrible."
good,In arriving to work it is mandatory to do a checklist of all duties assigned to the department. Customer service is always first and knowledge of the workplace is a must. The management team were competent and helpful at times. The hardest part of the job was picking up the slack of other employees regardless of time. The most enjoyable time would be the interaction and assisting customer.
good,The job was very taxing on the body and you needed to keep your speed up to meet company requirements of production. You worked in a cold environment very early in the morning till late at night. Hours were hard on family life but the pay was amazing. The benefits were also very good.
good,"Was able to jump right in, and with the right attitude, could learn job skills on site. Was able to be involved with the day to day operation of the store when seen as a reliable contributor. Worked on teams to fulfill tasks, which was rewarding. Over time, was able to be used in a variety of tasks that showed my abilities as a productive worker who could stay on task."
good,"The day started at 3 am, however I always show up 30 minutes or so to work, after clocking in we had a 5 minute start up and then started making moves."
good,While at Walmart my management often fluctuated. i had a couple good managers as wells as some not so good managers. there is a lack of checks and balances in Walmart. assistant mangers and csms often over step what they are aloud to do.
good,"The jobs you do are very easy but it's the management that drives you away. They want you to work hard and do whatever you have to for the company but when it comes to your personal life they don't care, from my experience. I was terminated because the day I was sick I missed work and because of my ""response"" to a question between my manager and I she chose to clear my coaching after already approving it. They do a lot of out spite so be mindful to go in and work and not worry about anything else."
good,"The job was alright the coworkers talked down on everybody tho and some customers are super picky or just don't understand what your telling them. Walmart will start cutting everyones hours if corporate doesn't want to pay it, still had about 35 hours a week"
good,Sometimes it's a great place to work and sometimes it isn't. In the long run it is just okay except the holidays people yelling at you for no reason other than to ask a question.
good,for the short time i was there most training was done at a computer not really a hands on training company. I had my fair share of both nice co-workers and not so nice co-workers. it was a fun job and the career choices were great too. The management however played favorites a lot which was unfair in the workplace
good,"It an ok place to work"
good,It should be a temporary job. They do not work with you if you have things come up. The management can be rude and do not care about you as a person. They will overwork you and under pay you. Do not recommend.
good,"Not interested in rating a company I no longer work for, but the cash office associate position was a learning experince also many new advances in the technology"
good,"First of all, my manager at Walmart DC is super great. However, There are certain things I do not agree on."
good,First job and it was good starting off because they worked around my school schedule. Downside is that i was hired as a cashier and was a lot more than just that. I stressed too much while working there. Holidays aren't the best to be working here
good,"Trabajo administrativo, visitas a las tiendas, reuniones toda la semana.     Los horarios son un poco extensos. Se respetan los tiempos de colación y lo mas importante se trabaja los fines de semana."
good,I enjoyed interacting with customers the most. The job tasks were not hard at all. Drama in the work place is not needed and this is what caused me to leave my position at the company.
good,This was my first retail job. It will definitely be my only. Its a lot of standing and walking. A lot of customer service skills is involved and needed at this job. It takes a toll on the body.
good,Walmart has it's pros and cons. Management is mixed with views on policys. When you need to change your availability they give you problems. The my share is nice as well as paid time off. They have some benefits but has to come out of your check. When it comes to wanting full time it's very sketchy.
good,Very Busy durning the holidays and a very face paced store its a nice enviroment to work in and there are some good benefits and the hours are flexiable
good,Forklifting driving consisted of keeping up with your productivity. The hours were long but people got paid a reasonable amount. Management was well organized throughout the warehouse.
good,"my time at walmart was mehhhh, it was a job, i went, i worked, i left, there isn't much opportunity for advancement, basically all you can do is put your head down and keep working."
good,Nous sommes un peu traités comme des numéros chez Walmart. Assez dur de concilier travail/étude car peu de compréhension de leur part.
good,"It was a good place to work to get by in college. I learned a lot about working in the field of sales and finance. The staff was amazing, and the training I recieved helped a lot."
good,"Walmart is stuck in a loop of attempting to protect their image, and trying to create the highest amount of profit. This often times leads to the media being shown one thing and associates experiencing another. An example is the pay raises that have been advertised over the past few years. Every time a pay raise is announced, there is a dramatic scale back in help. In the three years I worked there my department alone went from having three fulltime and a parttime associate who received 25-30 hours a week, to having two fulltime associates and being told there were no more hours available to schedule even for empty shifts or lunch breaks. "
good,"The managers liked to yell about little things and would often get you in trouble for small things. The benefits we're great however food was only discounted  part of the year. And of course, it was mandatory to work Thanksgiving and Black Friday, which, I think, is not okay by any means."
good,The hours are constantly changing. The base week is 50 hours. Switch between overnight and day shift. Hard to balance home life with work. You can take vacation but never knew what my schedule was going to be.
good,Walmart have a great work environment overnight relaxing but have enough work for you to keep busy the benefits are good especially the 401k and life insurance
good,Can be very stressful and employees are usually held to unreasonable standards. Time off can be hard to get approved despite legitimate reasons even if requested well before the minimum time frame. If you have the patience to deal with the stressful environment on a daily basis then this job is decent at best.
good,"So I started working here and I was on the MOD Team so I worked alone for the most part. The other employees are friendly and I got along with the ones I saw the most. So I'm still in my probation period(90 days) and I get kidney stones. I'm out of work for 2 days while I was at the hospital and at home passing them. They prescribed me a medication that I had no idea I was allergic to. 1 pill every 4 hours. I couldn't even move or make myself get off the couch let alone wake up to eat or use the bathroom. Out for another 2 days and I go back, still taking them because I didn't know that was what was making me sick. I barely had enough strength to move or walk around. The lights were way to bright and gave me a headache. I get my assignments and head that way. The second I get over there, I collapse on the floor and all I can do is sit there and try to breathe. My manager found me and told me to go home and that it was an unexcused absence. So I stopped taking the meds and got my Dr's notes and they said that they no longer accept Dr's notes according to the state of Texas blah blah blah... I had half a day over the limit for probation and I was terminated after I had completed a full night of work."
good,"The managers need more communication as well as supervisors, the job itself was okay, just to much time being overworked.............................."
good,Would start my shift by unloading truck. Stocked my aisle until we pulled out the skids for night shift to  stock. I enjoyed unloading the truck. People i worked with were nice.
good,"Walmart has pros and cons. Pros would be the flexibility, job security even if you move you can always transfer. The benefits are okay but not the best. Cons would be the pay and their raises are really bad I was working there 10 years and only making 12 an hour."
good,I enjoyed working at walmart it was face paced and at the customer service desk we had regulars to send money or pay abill.. sometimes the managers werent very freindly to us employees ... I liked when i could help a customer with a problem they had
good,The overall job was easy and on target with expectations the human resources was there but it felt as though not for your own protection rather the store itself.
good,"Your integrity is very important to Walmart."
good,"Pure politics and favoritism.. they write up the wrong people, they dont appreciate what one does for the team........................................."
good,"the ajax location that i work at the managers are nice they ensure that the work is distributed evenly between employees, however my hours started dropping drastically while they were hiring new people."
good,The best part about working at Walmart was making friends with my coworkers and feeling comfortable asking questions. A big problem was being scheduled during my college classes even after being given my availability per semester.
good,When I first started it was a great environment to be in. Once they started changing around the procedure everything changed. People stopped caring and management would constantly put department managers in a stressful state.
good,"I always felt overwhelmed and over worked. It was hard to be led by their management team. I learned a lot at this location. However, this store allowed me to learn multiple departments; that help me at the later Walmarts."
good,"Its a fun place to work but they dont stay on top of things aka benefits, pay raises ECT. You get a 15 min break and an hour lunch and the biweekly is stressful when you only get 400 a check"
good,Best part about my job is the vendors and my fellow associates. Most of the managers are awesome but not store manager. The work on a regular day is simple but things can get stressful during the holidays.
good,I enjoyed the position I worked at walmart in the fabrics and crafts department. At times as most jobs it got stressful but nothing that was overwhelming.
good,Capable of gaining a lot experience if retail is the job for you. Roles need filling and if you can step up and serve the customers with a solid purpose then you can thrive in this job.
good,Depending on how hard of a worker and how much you miss butt you can move into management. If there is anything I've learned at Walmart you are replaceable at any time even assistant managers. As long as you do your work and go home you should be fine.
good,"It was an okay job to work at we also help customers we also decorate the store on holidays for customers we keep the area clean you help customers carry items today car if needed, I work in the Frozen and dairy area we continuously change food items that was up to date."
good,"When ever business was thriving (Holiday months) the work was great and busy and the hours would fly by. But almost as soon as the holidays where over, your hours would fall significantly which meant your pay would too."
good,I wouldn't recommend working here. There's hardly any opportunity to move up and they take harworkers for granted. They took my medical benefits away while I was on maternity leave.
good,"It was a very valuable work experience. It was my first position. It usually had a very busy atmosphere, so I kept the whole time. Management was extremely good."
good,"Walmart is great to work for as long as you don't have personal issues ie..devorce, death in family, child with illness.  The attendance policy is stricked and a leave of absence must be approved by a third party company called seduic.  They didn't approve my leave for my wife's surgery to remove cancer or for an injury that occurred at work that required bed rest."
good,Me sentía bien oía música trabajaba tranquila me gustaba hacer las cosas bien hechas
good,"A decent place to work, good benefits, if you can ignore the backroom politics and the lack of training and communication it's not bad. Start off at 10 and can get a dollar after you complete a ""training course""."
good,"got along with department managers, but the store manager is a horrible person, many managers below her have quit in the time i have been here. they do not take into consideration of peoples daily lives and employees are just a number to them."
good,"Working for Walmart was fun, I did love my coworkers, however the attendance policy was weird and the way they offered time off was complicated. The job overall was very laid back"
good,"walmart is a good working place, but the boss is not very flexible with time off and hours. I enjoy helping the customers. I've learned how to operate and fix the self-check out machines."
good,Walmart is a great place to work. I was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. Career advancement for me was easy. I learned so much there. of course it can be stressful but look at what youre dealing with. This is no dollar general this is a money making beast.
good,"Just like any other supermarket, the pay is minimum wage the shifts are outside of the 9-5 plus weekends. Great if you love people and take pride in your job."
good,"I worked with highly capable people.. except management in their management style.  One manager bullied her staff continuously without consequences due to upper management continuously evolving and contractors fear of reporting.  The other micro management heavily and was rude to the employees.  Even though they had on paper impressive credentials, their style was horrific and never called out.  I've worked with many companies and this was one of the worse in mistreatment of employees ."
good,"Everyday is different at Walmart. Some days are slower than others, some days are so fast paced that you don't have a change to breathe. My day starts off checking out customers and my day ends checking out customers."
good,Empresa boa de trabalhar com chances de crescimento.
good,"Overall it was good, very fast pace, people were nice, alot stock, you can get overwhelmed by the amount of stock on the floor as long as you pace yourself fast it can get done"
good,"Good enough place ta shop while you get your cars oil changed, and get your hair did,  love the popcorn chicken  and jalapeno poppers there but the parking leaves a bit to be desired"
good,"Very demanding, all stores are managed different but can be very over worked and under appreciated. The training has increased but still not consistent."
good,"good stable job to have, management is poor. team work is a huge concept at walmart but also not used by all of management. great people, lots of customer service."
good,"Walmart is very inconstant with their schedules. There is never a set schedule, you may work a closing shift one day and then work an opening the next and it just goes back and fourth like that. I felt as if TLE were underpaid because of the conditions we had to work in. Yes it's on the same pay grade as bakery and electronics, but they don't have to put up with the weather nor the hundreds of nasty cars that came through that we had to service. Also management was to nice. I understand that you have a policy of trying to sell to a customer, but there was multiple times when we would decline a vehicle for various reasons, ex. nail being to close to the sidewall or a hood latch being broke, and when the manager would come out he would tell us to do it because the customer went inside and whined and cried to the manager. Like I said I understand the policy of making customers happy, but there comes a time when you have to back your employees and trust that their judgement is true."
good,"As with most other warehouse jobs, they seem to go well until you hit the pay cap. Then you can expect any and every slime bag to crawl from the baseboards to find *any* reason to fire you. Always be on guard if you work here."
good,"I loved it at first but wanted to get better and Advance, and it’s been really hard to get there.  Working so hard and not really get an opportunity to move up unless you where someone “special”."
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for, it is stressful at times and could use a few Changes .."
good,Good place to work for some extra hours but don't expect to make a living off it. Coworkers are friendly but customers can be a but rude. Flexible hours but work every holiday
good,"I worked in the Deli dept. Very busy and demanding. Fussy customers, but I liked it. I was part-time waiting for full-time, but it didn't happen. I had to look elsewhere."
good,"Progression is very slow at Wal-Mart, the benefits are awful. They want to get away with everything as cheaply as possible and it makes it harder to do your job when they cut so many corners to save some pennies."
good,"My coworkers were a pleasure to work with and so was management. Like, getting more or less hours tended to be a problem, especially depending on the department you worked in."
good,I will never work for Walmart again.  They do not care about their employees.  From the time Sam Walton passed again Walmart is only worried about the bottom line.
good,"There was always something to keep you busy at work... trucks with stock/cleaning and restocking returned merchandise/ helping customers"
good,"Typical day greet customers, cash them out, etc. However, it can be stressful. Dealing with customers especially difficult ones takes you out of your element. The pay was decent at the time and benefits, but just the job itself was stressful. With highway traffic of customers coming in and out on weekends and holidays especially, and dealing with difficult customers most times, having the right amount of patience takes a lot."
good,"Most of the time it was waiting and being fast when we had to do so. I got really bad stress from the job. I learned everything Walmart had to teach me for basics and graduation. The management wasn't bad but also it wasn't good. The culture, i wouldn't know how to describe there culture, but if i could i guess it would be costumers first, it was the main thing people wanted there. The long hours with physical labor, but that's because i walk every where i go. The most enjoyable part would be when we were done with our day and just picking up trash around the area."
good,Usually 7-8.5 hour shifts. Usually half hour lunch break and 1-2 15 minute breaks. These breaks were mandatory which could prove disruptive especially on more busy days.
good,"Training was very short, people didn't want to answer questions.  I felt if I had better  training it would been a lot better.  Supervisor should just take there time with new employees."
good,I don’t think we get paid enough for what the managers expect us to get done without enough equipment and people. If the pay was better or at least got more people the job would be more relaxed.
good,Good place to work just had the wrong management . i had fun working there honestly i did you see so much diffrent things especially at night . if i could o would go back .
good,"There isn't anything that I would neither praise Walmart about, It was simply work our needed tasks until the shift was complete. I found the environment to be very dull, Although some good fellow employees made the lull a bit more bearable."
good,There are alot of unqualified and lazy employees who are not held accountable for there actions. Most days it seems as if they just wing it planning for work an it causes a huge backup of inventory.
good,Before changing the schedule policy please ensure that it will be fair to each and everyone. Don’t tell us you need our true availability and then cut our hours.
good,It was a good work place just lack of management communication. The manager named higeen was very rude to me but all the other managers are real coo and respectful. It’s a good place to work at very relaxing and stressful but comforting to be at
good,"Very fast-paced but gratifying work, laborious but enjoyable, management was very poor and accepted zero accountability over problems -they always passed the buck to those below them, their open door policy is a joke and doesn't work as there is nothing to stop managers from taking vengeful actions against employees who go over their heads"
good,"Thoroughly enjoy what I do an a day to day basis. However, leadership within the organization has been incredibly shaky and there is wide-spread morale decline and uncertainty about the future direction of our organization and company."
good,"Mediocre. If you need a job these jobs will leave you frustrated when you leave and anxious coming back. The stress varies from position to position, but it is very easy to keep your job there. So all in all, pays bills.  The end."
good,"Great company but horrible management, workers talk to much on the lines and barley gets any work done,  they don't care if your sick or dying they'll give you points for it."
good,This company is different to work for from store to store. When there are too many managers giving direction to employees there is some questions as to who to listen to when trying to get multiple jobs done at once. So what I would say to someone considering this company is do not set expectations too high until you find your place in the system.
good,Walmart was an ok place to work. I did like the flexibility and the somewhat family atmosphere. The advancement opportunities were limited especially with no money involved in the promotion. The constant change was also a problem at times. The benefits could have been better but overall ok.
good,Retail can be tough during the holidays. A bad manager can make a bad environment just as a good one can make it good. Good benefits and fair pay. Generally a steady schedule.
good,"Walmart es una empresa en donde puedes tener estabilidad laboral, péro su ambiente no es el mejor para estar por mucho tiempo."
good,los horarios son muy rolados y para crecer esta muy dificil
good,It stressful. It's always under staff. Managers work overtime everyday sometimes 15 hour day. You only get paid for 45 hours per week and you may work 60 to 70 hours a week. You will miss alot of family events. Because you are on standby at all times
good,Les patrons ne se parlent pas entre eux. Mauvaise communication
good,"Shame that the job is really boring and so repetitive.  No variety, or opportunity to put some of yourself into the role ... basically a flowchart job ... do this, do that, then do this ..."
good,"It's a retail job, nasty customers most of the time, but get some decent ones now and then that kind of make up for the nasty ones. Like most retail jobs work holiday's."
good,It's a simple job and pays decent. However your success relies on other people doing their job correctly. Something that management fails to acknowledge and can lead to poor performance on your record if say your fellow lift driver or days side picker chose not to do their job(follow established rules) correctly/expediantly so that they could boost their own production #'s.
good,"If you enjoy retail work and what it entails, Walmart is a good place to go. They are willing to work with you on your hours as much as they can, they pay well for the work being done, and will supply other benefits as time goes on."
good,"Everything was fine in the beginning until I got comfortable. The managers were unorganized, well some of them were completely unprofessional. They do not give you your breaks on time."
good,The day consist of organization making sure everything is in it's place before I start my day. Also input data entry and filling paperwork and reports that have been researched. Working with management and making sure there notes get done. The enjoyable part of my job was getting everything done and always feeling like I accomplished my daily duties.
good,"Walmart was an okay place to work. It's a job that pays decently well, with low hours for cashiers. Management never really tried to work with you, always had to go above their heads to actually get somewhere."
good,Dealing with the night shift has to do with stocking shelves. Usually there is not enough people to get the job done. This causes the stocks to pile up and not get completed leaving unsatisfactory needs for the customers.
good,"Set up registers.Placement of  Cashiers , monitor breaks,  and Lunches,Getting loans for registers,monitor lines.  Help customers and ringing when needed. How to price change ,do inventory, deal with different types of people. I learned that some Managers are out for moving up at no cost. dealing with different directions for one project by management. The crew you work with and the customers."
good,I made a lot of friends while working and I loved the people I worked with. I believe that the managers could treat the staff better but the overall job was great.
good,My day started with clocking in and then going to a computer to see where i was being assigned to. I then took over the register and made sure my station was clean and then started to check people out. The management tried to stay on top of things but sometimes I had to wait a while to get the change i needed. The workplace was busy as it would be with any busy store. The hardest part was having to deal with the attitudes of the customers and the mess some people would make.
good,"Fast Paced and sometimes unpredictable days. The customer determines the needs. New changes being made for routines and processes are good. "
good,"unloading merchandises, checking the cost, sorting items when comes off the truck, counting items with the scan gun. sorting items on the line and putting into the  boxes and on the shelves jn the backroom. Receving liquors and beverages off the trucks, clothes, shoes, toys television etc.,, Alot heavy items that I had to unloaded off the truck every morning for 3rd shift job with other staff members."
good,"When I started working for Wal-Mart it was great, however they try to spin the whole we're a family thing and then treat you otherwise. They say you get better benefits every year, however if you actually look at the numbers and everything they become less and less every year. They are always changing how things work and are ran in every store and never for the better and actually end up doing more harm than good to their employees."
good,I worked in many different stores. It was a challenge to interact with different customers and techs each day. It made me a better pharmacist. There seemed to be more tech hours that some of the other chains.
good,"Headed the right direction, but not fast enough. Many old school cut throat managers still there. Many uneducated managers causing high turnover and unprofessional atmosphere at times. Great pay and benefits. Great opportunity for advancement up to Assistant Manager."
good,can get pretty busy especially during the beginning of the month and during special occasion. Can get stressful during these times but the key is to remain calm and have patience and remember your training
good,I enjoy working at walmart helping the customers find what they are looking for and helping check out people on the register when needed.  I enjoyed passing on the smiling face when helping customers find what they was looking for.
good,"Work only part time as a 2nd job in the customer service department. Mangement where always changing with new managers and co managers..  Friendly co-workers,"
good,No comments I worked for the company 18 years with mostly good experiences. Overall if you're partnered with a good market team then you are in good hands.
good,I liked working here. I had many positions I handled while employed there. I did have some personal  issues I had to deal with at that time.and had to take too many days off. the associates at that time were willing to help out each other whenever someone needed help. they were like a family.
good,Walmart was a good job for what a time. But it was also part-time work and not easy to move up and make a career out of it.Loved the people there and the environment as well.
good,"In short, just as I had mentioned in the review summary. A few years back Walmart was all about their customers and employees. Now, with new policies in place, the company is strictly for the company."
good,"I'm a broke college kid. It's a job. It paid the bills for a little while. Unfortunately where I worked, there was very little room for me to grow and advance."
good,Is ok place to work the managers are always trekking you different things some don't know what they are doing but shine are very good at what they do people you work with are great
good,"It pays the bills my first time around was fine. No issues, when i came back to the  company it was alright  at first, and then i got a first hand look at what Favoritism looks like.  Overall if you can handle a stressful underpaid work environment you'll be fine. It just wasn't the job for me."
good,"If you start from the bottom, as a cart pusher. Then attempt to move up into the store or offices through promotions. They compensate you according to numbers rather than ethically and fairly compensating the individual for the job they worked for on their own. Grades should be smaller or people compensated more fairly in doing the same job assignments. Better off to start outside of the company coming in for a high grade job if you want fair compensation."
good,The pay is really good and there is high chances of growing in the company. Managers did have the tendency to disrespect team members with the way they talk to them.
good,This company is a good company for young individual looking to pay for college books and get their feet wet in the the working world. However I would not suggest it a career goal. Great for learning and first job experience but aim higher in the long run.
good,great place to work ....mgnt teams were ok..enjoyable part: setting my schedule...hardest part: not having enough time to do my work...another con: having to cover other areas that were mine
good,It was ok to work there I had great help most of the time the only thing that really needs to change is better training for the dept mgr and assistant manager because the majority of them don’t have a clue as to what they are doing
good,"Long hours, no family work balance, stressful, pretty much worked every weekend. This was good pay so I couldn’t complain about that. It was the working every weekend while others in the same position received every other weekend off. It’s retail so you get the good and the bad."
good,"At Walmart I learned excellent self-initiative skills, communication skills/customer service skills, and I learned how to work in a constantly changing work routine."
good,"Overall Walmart taught me how to improve my customer service skills, learn how to communicate with others. Being able to help customers with any questions they had about the store merchandise."
good,no me gusto mucho ya que hay mucho favoritismo por parte de los lideres
good,Pasan por encima de ti con tal de darle satisfaccion a los jefes
good,"I go to work, do the job I am paid for, sometimes I have to work other departments, even if mine is not done. I do my work and I go home. There really isn't much I have to say about my job."
good,"Walmart was ok, they dont hire enough people to get the job done, so you are on your own with many tasks. I wouldnt want to work there again. They have no customer service."
good,"I love working for Walmart, but the downfall is that employees feel like they don't have to do but the bare minimum. Sometimes Mgt. doesn't hold certain people accountable and it's frustrating. The company in general is a great place to work and they pay exceptionally well."
good,"Typical work day. clock in and get to work right away. I learned a lot of things that helped me take care of myself and satisfy the customers. Management is good, they tell us what to do and know how to help out when we were stuck on what to do. Hardest part of the job was the amount of staffs we'd have. So we'd have to learn almost everything around the store just to keep the store going. And getting overwhelmed by customers when you're alone. Aside from the hard parts, things were easy to learn and everyone there was very friendly and understandable. I love everyone I work with here."
good,"Live and Die by your last visit.  What have you done for me lately approach?  Past performance is not a consideration.  New leader, new rules.  No continuity."
good,"Walmart is a decent company to work for, they seem to care about their employees. Managers and co-workers were for the most part pleasant. Walmart not only strives to make their customers happy but their employees also."
good,I liked working at Walmart when I first started but now I honestly don't like working there anymore because the overnights get paid more than us and they day crew (me) do way more work then the night crew and raise is not even on the table. The managers do not show any respect to the employees and if they don't like what you have to say they fire you.
good,"The job has had its ups and downs, I’ve enjoyed my time, was able to advance quite quickly with the company. Overall, I would recommend this place to work at."
good,"Great place to work if you are starting out new or need a job quickly. "
good,If you like throwing out your back and making your knees give out at an early age then this is the place for you. You work constantly and it never stops till break then after its right back at it. if you dont keep up with your percent youll be written up. Mangers were really friendly and would cut up with you.
good,"If you have been there then you may be aware. I think that is enough said. Upper store management paid well and that was apparent. Not much trickles down from there. Average day was managing thirty -three employees over every department. Including were lawn and garden, which was always a hike to get to, pharmacy(supply change and key turn overrides) same for vision department. Electronics, lay-a-way, photo, customer service, front cashiers, money services and jewelry."
good,good company to work for but could not advance. was on third shift as the support supervisor. wanted to take the next step to be an assistant but was held back.
good,Walmart also taught me a lot about working as team. My co-worker were amazing and the manger of my department was wonderful. I see her from time to time and she has actually move up.
good,Not a bad place to work just very unlikely to be offered full time position and that combined with the fast pase and  stress levels of maintaining the high standards makes it a less desirable place of employment with each passing year
good,"they make you do extensive hours and sometimes do not care what you have going on, especially during the holidays, overall its ok but they could pay more."
good,It’s not a good place to work.Thsy do not work with your on your hours when u sick or need time off. They have you doing more then your job title for a low pay. They do not communicate with you about nothing.
good,It’s a nice place to work. Very productive and professional. Management was somewhat ok but good for the moment. The pay is good when you don’t have any responsibilities.
good,"Typical day was staging pallets of product, and stocking of depts based on assigned layout per person. I learned about effective storage utilization, and organization.  Management I found to be ill trained in people skills and troubleshooting. Workplace culture is pretty standard for large company retail chain, very team oriented. The hardest part of job is the overnight schedule, and can be physical depending on dept.  The most enjoyable part is the friendly atmosphere, and staff on nights which are pretty laid back."
good,"Wal-Mart was at one point an fantastic employer.  With a strong culture and a true meritocracy for promotional opportunities.  I feel over the last half decade, experienced associates from senior leaders down to associates have been replace by less qualified and far less hard working.  It is a shame because experience and loyalty was once coveted."
good,it was a good job for my first time working there i would consider other people to work here if their trying to start a career and build a resume.....
good,Walmart is great for a secondary income. The pay is not enough for cost of living. The hours are good. The management I had was great. Plenty of room for cross training and advancement.
good,"No Uniform needed, only a Walmart Vest on top of your choice to wear daily"
good,"Management needs more training. When a manager cannot tell you about regulations and policies, if they do not know what they are. They ask around and most of time they do not have an answer for you. They should also excuse absences with doctor or clinical documentation."
good,"The lab was clean and climate controlled. Never a terrible place to work. You would think there was good job security, but they laid off everyone and there were too many managers."
good,10 year associate probably would have stayed but changes were made within my area that hurt me more then it helped. Ive learned alot during my time with the company.
good,"There isnt much to look forward to with a career at walmart. If you're smart and a hard worker, you can advance quickly, but then you max out. Once you reach the maximum position they can offer you, pay raises are almost negligible, and some years their senior employees get passed over so that newer employees can get larger raises to compensate for the companies overall public appearance."
good,"First when you work it might seem fun, but the longer you work it gets repetitive management is poorly. They doesn't  have their associates working fairly some work more than others. Some workers go hide out while the work load is left on the other employees."
good,too many managers giving instructions and not talking to each other about the assignments and time frames are not realistic.  There are times that the employees feel like they are not appreciated  for the work they do .  There are times when we are given assignments and are let alone to get them done.
good,"You must work with a sense of urgency and take care of your customers. Walmart has plenty of career growth potential, if you are willing to work hard and follow policies and procedures."
good,The store had Poor management . A great central idea but wrong approach. A lot of responsibilities as a department manager but good hours and benefits.
good,"this job is slow at times epecially when your cashier or front end. got to fix candies on your register. tighty up your area. when its slow there is not much to do, and you cant just stand around when there is no costumers you have to do be doing something. the hardest and tiring time is that you are always standing, and your feet will most likely hurt, its useful if you have confortable shoes/tennies shoes."
good,"Trabalho com muita pressão para atingimento de metas sem necessidade, provocando inclusive o retrabalho. Metas com curto tempo de cumprimento, incentivando a realização de trabalhos mal feitos que não refletem a realidade."
good,Going in at night and stocking shelves overnight wasn't a easy task for me even though i adjusted it took me a while because i was in school pursuing my nursing career. I learned how to be a team player.
good,"My typical day at work: clocking in, getting on the register and checking out customers. The breaks and lunches are either too early or too late. The management team at store 1024 is very unprofessional. Seeing familiar customer faces and being able to talk with them and share life experiences with them is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,point system sucks . doctors notes wont save you .didnt mind doing the job . i wish i never got let go . i need a job and it was close to my house. other than the point system it wasnt a bad job
good,Was my first job. I was a cashier and there for over a year. Pretty decent job but a few managers was tightwads and they played favoritism a while lot
good,it was a good place to work but it had it challenges. . Some management did not know how to talk to people at all. It was dis organized at times. I learned a lot from being a Department manager. Had a Great Assistant Manager that guided me and help me grow as a person.
good,the best part about walmart is the ability to learn so many different departments. you can move your schedual and because of the number of employees it is pretty easy to get specific days off.
good,"The management would pick favorites, over work/underwork emplyees, give random time off, or not enough time off, there was no middle ground, they had positives, my coworkers are nice and some extremely helpful, but they need to have better management."
good,"Overall it was a nice experience. It was very fasted paced and demanding, but it helps build your overall ability to work and problem solve within a set amount of time."
good,Store I worked at was very tightly run.  I have not experienced that from a customer viewpoint since I left.  The management was constantly watching the lines to be sure that there were not long lines waiting to check out.
good,"Friendly customers, great place to work, will need dedication and motivation to maintain there. "
good,"Walmart has a great atmosphere when it comes to its associates. Everybody is kind and is willing to help or answer questions. The management however was not great at managing its associates. They would constantly be moving employees from department to department because they didn't have a solid plan on how to get everything done on time. They don't provide third shift with the tools to get their job done because some previous employees had lost tools on the shift, while allowing 1st and 2nd shift to access them. This resulted in slower work because employees can't find where items belong in stocking. They then write you up if you dont finish your area for a lack of productivity. It's 100% backwards and quite silly to be honest. Another thing worth mentioning is doctors notes don't mean anything to them, they won't even look at it. An associate I knew had a concussion and they told them,  ""I would recommend you miss work or you'll be terminated."" Just something to consider, to them you are not a human, strictly a liability."
good,"I was a picker!! Putting customers orders and cancel they order if we didn’t have at the warehouse. Work as a teamworker leading order employees, work on computers looking up orders making sure that we have what they order I’m the warehouse."
good,They are a company you can grow with. The management was not understanding. But overall they are a good company. They have changed alot of rules. You can also invest in stocks
good,It wasnt a good fit for me and what i expected out of a large corporation. The management was never on the same page. You were often given tasks that could not be fulfilled on too of your daily expectations.
good,"In my experience there is a lot of opportunity for advancement and career growth within the company if you show you have great work ethic, attendance and commitment."
good,"count money, data entry,stock and organize shelves"
good,"Fun and easy workplace, but a part-time associate need to wait to much to obtain benefits (a year). Management listen the associates and always do the best  to help them, and always say ""Thank you"""
good,"worked at gas station, ran register. help customers. stocked shelves. zoned area worked in electronies answered the phone helped customers site to store"
good,"management was the worse"
good,It's getting better all the time for associates. Walmart has a great website for employees it makes you feel like you really know what's going on with Walmart and when you're looking at the website it really seems like they're trying to offer more inside opportunities for associates all around.
good,"A typical day at work is punching in, read over duties left by department manager, make sure to complete it before end of shift, help in other departments when needed, and stop theft."
good,"It is not as bad a place to work as popular opinion says. The pay is fair ,and they have a very reasonable attendance policy. The insurance is affordable, and they match 401k up to 6%."
good,"I got paid well.,good benefits, but some of the store managers refused to change with the company and some were very disrespectful to the associates.!"
good,"A typical day a work would be mostly quiet, I was the most reliable cashier, I was always on the floor attending to the register. Most of the time I stayed because they didn't have enough coverage."
good,"I only worked here for 3 months, but everyone I worked with seemed to really enjoy working here. It's an easy job to do, and the management team is mostly stellar."
good,"I liked working there but if you wasn't a favorite then you got treated like dirt. Usually the newbies got the bad shifts and I already knew most of the job entailed. On the late shifts there wasn't a manager on the clock nor by that time was there any higher up managers on the clock. It was fast-paced and I needed to be on my feet for the whole shift, which isn't a big deal but come on. The hardest part was working as a deli clerk I ended up being diagnosed with carpel tunnel in both of my wrists. The really only enjoyable part was I was able to be away from my home for a little bit."
good,The pay and hours are good but if you want advancement you have to know people or they’ll undermine you. The managers all loved me but constantly had their “hands tied” when it came to giving raises
good,Walmart has a great teamwork of management who is always willing to help customers and their employees at any time. They greet everyone with a smile from morning to night.
good,"I would never wotk for another Walmart . No one stands up for you, when something happens you on your own. I want to work for a company that cares for thier employees"
good,"Work day includes placing stock on shelves. Conducting inventory, using electronic media to control perpetual inventory. Culture preaches how much associates are valued however management won't do anything for you."
good,"They have unrealistic expectations, manager barely knew English and would talk bad about and discriminate against employees in front of them when bought to higher up nothing was done. expected regular employees to do management task without allowing them access to tools needed and would give disciplinary actions if not fulfilled"
good,Walmart had a decent work environment filled with people that were doing what they could.  I learned that relying on other people for help can be both good and bad.
good,"A day at Walmart is ever changing. I learned and grown so much with the company,  Multitasking is a must. An associate can be anywhere from grocery online process to unloading a truck. My biggest challenge is succeeding in making the most disgruntled person smile. The workplace culture is customer based. Customer needs comes before the needs of the associates. The hardest part with working for Walmart is knowing that you have to schedule holiday plans around work and not on the holiday. The most enjoyable part of my day is helping and having the product for the consumer. Its for someone's birthday, anniversary, or Christmas present."
good,"I worked 1-10PM in sporting goods.  This was my choice.  Nobody wanted it.  Manager’s change quarterly and each one is different.  I was forced to day shift and to other departments on an intermittent basis, which often left sporting goods unattended.  The policy was no overtime, unless pre-approved.  Almost every day I worked past my end of shift due to customer of store needs.   I worked the register, stocked shelves and assisted customers with storewide product location.  I mixed paint, cut keys, performed background checks and sold firearms.  I enjoyed it most of the time.  My pay was under $11.00/hour for 40 hours per week."
good,"The Pay and benefits are good, just the fact that management seen to pick favorites. You could be a really good employee and still be over looked for positions, even when they know you are fully capable.  I really was a hard worker with a good attitude an did my fair share of work and even volunteered to help other areas when needed, they just didn't take me serious like i wanted them too."
good,Cleaning and keeping store safe. Some management works with you and it seemed others didn't. A friendly place to work.Learned to use heavy machines for cleaning floors.
good,"El Salarios es bajo para las funciones que se realizan, y actualmente es difícil una promoción, lo que es un hecho es que no tenia problemas con el horario y fue muy estable el trabajo en mi estancia laboral,"
good,"slow paced"
good,Walmart is ok for someone who really needs employment. Great benefits of you can make pass a year. They prefer to promote within the company. They ask too much of their employees.
good,Walmart in Choctaw was a decent place to work. Management was pretty good and most coworkers my age were cool. The job itself was very repetitive though and wasn’t too fun.
good,"But overall it’s a cool chilled job fun at times, just needs much help when it comes to management.The  environment  Is safe. The  associates were nice."
good,"Best part about it was working with well rounded coworkers who laughed and joked yet still held their role in the place of business."
good,Very high stress level at this point. Cutting hours and increasing the work load on the associates and the management team. Pay and benefits are in line. Pay should be increased to keep up with rising cost of living.
good,Job is good but management makes it hard and stressful. There are times a transaction is requiring a management approval and management takes too long or never show up to do their job.
good,I worked at the biggest retail store in the United States with that I was at the top of my game in motivating 280-320 associates a day in a 24-7 operation.I improved sales and reduced shrink as co manager all four years in that position.More importantly I was driven and  succeeded in superior customer service for 10 plus years I was with the  company.
good,"It seemed like a good company before corporate really started forcing change on the stores, and changing operations. Our store was the first in Utah, but after we were assigned new management, it seemed as though the whole store's persona changed."
good,"Management doesn’t care about you, you are disposable to them because of all the new job applicants. The benefits don’t cover anything and the copay is out of the roof. Be ready to be miserable at work."
good,"I loved the people I worked with, but the management was not good and treated everyone very poorly. Even if we would finish stocking the merchandise we revived that day we would be told that we are not doing enough. We had a lack of the tools that we needed to succeed and lost a lot of new comers because of this. There was also a lack of attention on managements end. I would have more good to say about Walmart but there was a lack of good experiences."
good,"Looking for career change from retail "
good,They are pretty ok to work for. The management will help you and work with you. Walmart is very family ornated and very understanding to family emergency.
good,There really is not much to complain about Walmart that cannot be said about any other big retail chain. If there was one complaint I had was that all the weird team work songs and all the pamphlets and magazines they gave us felt a bit cultish.
good,"tranquilo"
good,"I was a VP at Walmart (promoted into that position), and Walmart provided great compensation and benefits.  It was a big team for me to manage (went from managing 10 to 50), and the workload was too much."
good,Working at Walmart doesn't cater to the flexibility for a single parent. There are not enough sick days. When short staffed it becomes very difficult.
good,A typical day consists of coming in and assessing the priorities for the daily business as well as planning ahead. Making sure you have essential staffing in the high traffic areas to be able to help the customers. Making sure processes are being completed daily to ensure in stock and controlled freight flow. Planning for the upcoming changes and what resources will be needed to complete the tasks that will be needing completed. The hardest part of the job is being able to have the people to delegate to and rely on to get jobs done on time. The most enjoyable part is seeing your plans unfold successfully leading to increased sales and profit for the business. The workplace culture is very diverse and teaches you how to work with many different types of people in difficult situations.
good,It was an ok job the managers were all rude and didnt act like the company wanted them to. They treated workers with favoritism and some wouldnt give you the time of day to help with questions.
good,most management was good but others were not the level of production being asked for was to high at times the culture was real relaxed as far as you were left alone to do your job
good,They didnt care what I had going on with my new born sick daughter they only wanted me to work without having to take any days off for my daughter who was a preemie
good,Job has good days and Bad. Management doesn’t have a clue and there’s no Communication. Otherwise a decent place with fair pay wages. Definitely room for improvement however
good,"Walmart was a blast, 2 years i spent was enjoyable. Alot of customers and stress but it was worth it in the longrun. Its a fun job if you like standing and helping customers all day like i did"
good,"Third shift was my favorite shift to work because of there being a better opportunity to work together as a team. Everyone helps each other out to complete all of the work and treats each other like family. The main issue/hardest part of the job is communication between members of management and their associates or constantly changing their minds on where people should be. There is a lot of opportunity to move up in the company but the issue with that is, they promote their “favorites” and not necessarily the associates that deserve it more and would be better assets. I’ve learned that no matter how honest and up front you are with them, it doesn’t mean they will be honest with you or take your concerns seriously."
good,Difficult but fun learn a lot made good friends customers were jerks but what’s new managers were OK Brakes were standard nice hour long lunch OK food fun times nice benefits good pay
good,working at Walmart as a cap2 was kinda hard no one really showed me what needed to be done . sometimes coworkers will help but other times they just dnt want to.
good,hours and work were inconsistent and you may be hired for one area but be placed to work in another example: Cashier could be a cart associate for the day with no warning in the -30 degree weather. May arrive at 8am but next shift doesn't arrive work till 11pm ect. The people are great and they are fantastic about getting you your lunch and breaks. Great benefits.
good,"fun work place, but not very good managers, there employees are treated poorly. They have excellent co-workers there , and they work as a team for the most part."
good,workkng at Walmart was easy. I only did the job I applied for and I wasn’t asked to do much else. The pay was good and I got good hours as well. The only con I would have is they give you full time hours on a part time schedule so they don’t have to give you benefits.
good,"I have worked for Walmart in several locations .. I found the staff very friendly and helpful, a good place to work in general. I found that some of the managers were very friendly and others seem to want to be a bit pushy at some of the stores. I worked as a Merchandiser, Warehouse Associate, Cashier ,Store Standards and also Night Manager."
good,"Work was slow most of the time, I'm a type of person who likes fast-paced work all the time cause I get bored if work is slow. Management always changed and I didn't get all the hours I needed."
good,"nueve horas de trabajo ,aprendi a trabajar en equipo,buen ambiente , mucha cultura, lo mas difícil era tratar con los compradores y lo que mas me gusto fue el compañerismo y el respeto entre compañeros ."
good,I have no comment to make with regards too working for this company. I find the training of management to be of very poor quality for the assistant mangers. the work culture is unfair as favoritism is rampant.
good,Management is not always the best or helpful. The pay is not all that good. The hours are not guaranteed and most of the time Walmart does cut your hours.
good,The shifts are bad. We never get on breaks or lunches on time. the front end manger is rude mostly. the hardest time at work is being the with no coverage. the best time is going home
good,Working at Walmart is a fun place . Being a cart pusher I was barely in the store I was always outside gathering up carts. During the stocking part I had to mostly be in freezers stocking foods.
good,Typical workday you  go in on load the truck put out  freight go home at 11  what have I learned   Nothing good just a whole Lotta mass  management awful   Work culture OK could be better  hardest part of the job the managers always change their mind on Waze to put out the freight
good,"Walmart is a decent place to work if you are someone that doesn't go to school or have a job and you need to support yourself. However, I would not recommend this job to a teenager or college student. Walmart literally does not care about your school hours at all and will make you work 8 hours a day on school days. The managers only care about making money and not their employees. One of my former co workers requested a couple days off work in advance because his wife was delivering a baby and the Walmart managers wouldn't let him get the day. Like really? You want him to miss his daughter being born? He ended up quitting anyway because he wasn't missing his child's birth They don't care about anything at all that isn't related to Walmart. I asked multiple times for my hours to be cut because it was becoming difficult for me to be a fulltime student and handle 35-40 hours of working at Walmart and they eventually let me go and honestly, I wasn't upset about it."
good,"During my time at Walmart I felt that I mostly enjoyed the people around me. Everyone seemed pleasant and had a good attitude towards each other; however, the turn over rate was horrible. The people seemed to flow in and out with the boxes. It was hard not to make a mistake over time, and they would sure go after you when you did. It was not a forgiving place to work. People were afraid of getting fired to often."
good,"It's not a bad place to work, and it pays well for what you're doing, but I personally found it rather unfulfilling. It's fine if you're okay with mindless drone work and there's plenty of room for advancement if you're comfortable with the idea of being a cog in the great machinery of the company, but it's certainly not the sort of career I want to be in for the next five, ten, twenty years."
good,"duties were in the produce section which was very heavy-lifting, stooping, fast-paced and did not meet up to the hourly wage.  Expected too much out of one employee."
good,"Tell you what I've done 2 years, had about ten different positions except support or assistant manager, the job security/advancement is poor."
good,It’s a great company that needs a lot of improvement. Always opportunity to move up. Lots of great benefits. And community involvement. I am not going to bash Walmart because at the end of the day it’s one of those it is what u make it type of jobs. There needs to be improvement in respect for the individual.
good,My day consisted of cleaning bathrooms. My help was never actually working she hid on her phone and when brought to management several times nothing was done. All it is was a big popularity contest and people who are over worked. They work with you on hours perfectly but as far and work problems and co worker conflict there's too much. I wouldn't recommend unless your someone who sticks to themselves. The base pay is$11.00 dollars an hour but with the childish games there and how rude mangers are to their associates I would not recommend.
good,"While working here, I have realized how to better advance my people skills. Yet it is difficult to work here. The benefits are great, but if you do one thing wrong on accident you won't ever get any requested days off or be talked nicely to by some members of management."
good,"Fast paced environment on a daily basis"
good,"Overall I give it a 2. When iI first started I would have given it a 6. They say everything they are doing if for the employees, but it seems like it is for management."
good,"They  will work with you, just do your gob and be kind. Some times you have to be lenient with them so thel listen to you with your problems. But there fare most of the time."
good,"The many job options that are available makes easy to work and do whatever you are cabaple of. The company prefers to hire from within so job option available mean that employees that will always have the chance to ""climb the lighter""."
good,"The job itself is alright. The company admits they're all about the customer, but lacks the ability to meet demand in scheduling to help the customer body. My experience with them has been frustrating in the aspect of, my job becomes more difficult when the lack of human resource is imminent. I enjoy spending time with individual customers to find the different things that are going to help them the most, and with such a large company, in a place as popular to shop at, it's near impossible when there is a single associate on the floor. "
good,"A typical day at work is doing many jobs that are not yours and constantly having a full plate of work to do. Very difficult to receive breaks or getting them on time. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with negativity all the time either from customers or co-workers; work would much more enjoyable if employees operated in a professional matter. I learned patience and team leadership skills after teaching new employees the in's and out's of the job. Most enjoyable part of the job would have to be holiday's - not including how busy the store gets, but the activities we would do such as catering or birthday parties."
good,They had a big break room . those hour lunches came in clutch too . It was alright there . The managers were so so . Lots of work though so yeah that's that
good,"I enjoyed working there, I was just not getting enough work hours to sustain my obligations. I was promised a full time position but it turned out I was only given less than 20 hours a week to work."
good,Walmart provides few to no benefits for most roles since most work is part time.  Hours and pay are generally low.  Supervisors are friendly.  Opportunities for advancement are there for those who show interest and provide good customer service.
good,"This is an ok company to work for, the pay is good but trying to get a decent amount of hours to work is hard. They are more driven by numbers and money vs customer care"
good,"Working as an Automotive Technician, you deal with a lot of patience-demanding times. Some days, everything will roll smoothly, no hiccups. Other days, it's pure chaos between being short-handed, dealing with customers, getting customer vehicles out in a timely manner, and stopping to do whatever the manager asks you to do. It isn't the worst job at all, I've had plenty of good times in the Automotive department, but it isn't perfect."
good,It was a job. It’s not bad by working my hours. Most Associates are friendly. Most Managers are nice & work your time when you need it. They’re always lack of help.
good,My over all time there wasn't bad. My coworkers were friendly and always had each other's backs. I only ever had a problem with one person and I had that taken care of through upper management.
good,working with the people in this company is ok very nice people they very friendly and good people the hours in this company to me can be giving out more
good,A typical day in the life of a Stocker for Walmart 20+ years age consisted of loading and unloading trucks and stacking the pallets in the back stock room orderly. That customer service is at the utmost importance with this company. The work place culture was very amicable. The hardest thing about this job was the commute as I was driving 1 hour to work and 1 hour from work every day. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people that I worked with. It made the distance more enjoyable.
good,"Walmart was an okay experience. Management is terrible but your coworkers make it easier. Customers are customers. No matte rhow hard you work, management will find a way for you to be the blame for their downfalls. Not intending to go back. No overtime options available and you can be written up if you get it even if you're asked to work more hours."
good,"Walmart Inc. is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores. Wikipedia."
good,"I worked here over 20 years ago. I started as a cashier. I worked on the floor in Health and Beauty aids, hardware, pets, frozen food and I also worked in lay-a-way and customer service."
good,"Walmart is a good starting job but not a good career. You have to fight to get hours and Management isn't always your side. There are plenty of opportunity to move around in the store, but not in moving up,"
good,There are a lot of things to do but not enough staff to do it with. Training of personnel is not adequate the majority is learn as you go. you are the mercy of whoever went to the training to train you'
good,"the management at that walmart was high and low, some power hungry, some relaxed and very helpful. overall it is a good temp job, but not for a career."
good,Walmart has no work/life balance. there is no care or concern for their employees. proper training is not given. management is not understanding. they consider everyone as quickly replacable.
good,Busier stores pay the same as slower stores. The company doesnt understand high volume stores. Too mamy levels of managment with thier own agendas. Inconsistant work schedules. Company does not provide enough hours for high volume stores.
good,"Really the job is easy, given a good management team and proper resources. But walmart is always getting rid of positions so your job security isn't guaranteed."
good,"I was a dept manager. I worked freight, ordered, stocked, cleaning, set planograms. Took care of customers, . Paper work.  Enjoyed Working with associates"
good,"Walmart is by no means great, but it is alright if you need a part time or flexible job. Most managers are awful, but there are many kind employees as well."
good,"Enjoyed my time working at Walmart, but the pay scale was not sufficient.  I particularly enjoyed working at Walmart during holiday season as well as developing relationships with co-workers."
good,Walk in then click in at 2 clock then start unloading the truck n down stocking without breaking anything then Stock the Merchandice on shelf. Fast but be safe! Help customers with what they looking for!
good,"I feel in my experience, Walmart does not promote management based on performance but rather how they get along with management. (good ole boy network)"
good,"we dont have a fun work place we do our jobs  and go home we ring up customers give our best customer service will not speak on management,the workplace culture is diverse the hardest part of the job is knowing you will not be able too advance because  only the people who management like get promoted"
good,"A day at work is very simple. Clock in, go to meeting, go to assigned department and get started. I learned some good communication skills while working here. Management is really fun and not to harsh on you, which is always a plus for me. Hardest part of the job is knowing where things are place. The most enjoyable part is all the people you can meet."
good,While I was working there I learned that u pretty much had to stay to yourself and watch what was said around plp because u had plp there that were nasty i there own way
good,Loved working at Walmart however it consumed your life and being in management you would of had to be single and no kids because I had no life just sleep Walmart sleep Walmart.
good,its a pretty good job great learning experience its just the people that makes it kinda hard to deal with but i perceived and did my job no matter what
good,"Other than it being a constant high school with rumors and childlike behavior, it's not all that bad. Upper management isn't the best though. Advancement isn't difficult up to a point."
good,"Took care of me when I was sick, or should I say the health insurance I pay for did. Managers aren't all on the same page and it frustrates the associates."
good,"Walmart HO office location(Mississauga Argentia road) is very convenient for people who live in GTA .  Even though you are working in canada project, most of the decisions are made in USA."
good,I feel that they should treat they employees better because they treat the customers better than the employees. They also work their employees too hard to where it don’t match the pay.
good,The only thing I really had a hard time with was the scheduling. VERY hard to get 40 hrs a week. There are no benefits offered as a part time employee
good,Management are not the best. I’ve learned a lot wiring there a got trained in so many different departments. It is a laid back but fast paced job I wouldn’t go back though
good,"I spent many years with the company, starting from the bottom pushing myself to the next promotion. It was not an easy task and the constant changes in the retail world was sometimes hard to master one thing when the next one had already started. A good place to work if you're ambitious enough and have the time to give. This isn't a 9-5 job and can't expect to leave on time every day, if any day. Unlike most reviews the employees are hardworking and very thoughtful, how they interact is soley based off the management in the store. I unfortunately was affected by the restructuring and still to this day am unsure after all the blood, sweat and tears I put into the company why I was let go. Instead of staying with the company and stepping down I decided to venture out because it became more reality that the way the company is headed there really isn't going to be a safe position within the company in a few years. This is to be said about most retailers as technology is rapidly growing and requiring less people to run the stores. I will never bad mouth the company as they did so much for me through my career and my personal life, but I can't say that about some of the managers I worked under."
good,"I would still work there if I had not fallen on hard times,and the company has a point system,and no bus stops at some locations. I really enjoyed my work. Unfortunatelty I felt like just a number when it came to corporate. My coworkers and ALL OF MANAGEMENT were awesome.Walmart Company Policy However , does not allow for EVEN THE MANAGER OF THE STORE to actually do as much as what my work superiors would have,and tried to do to keep me or any other employee."
good,"I mean, it was a job. They were flexible when I was a cashier and still going to school but when I became a CSM I was treated not so great. Worked a ton."
good,"Assistant Managers work on average 10 hours day."
good,"I loved working for wal mart. No matter what it was a good company to work for. "
good,Its a steady job not  to busy. Sometimes it gets busy and sometimes we have slow days. But other then that it's and ok place to work. It's a good part time job.
good,"Full-time team member dudes include freight organization, distribution, and customer service. people are the most valuable part of the company; it is what keeps things going."
good,A typical work day was stress full by the end because I was being judge for who is was and my way at going by the safety rule. they did not use the safety rules that the company set into place
good,Walmart is a great company to work for as an hourly associate at least at the DC level. As you move into the management level the work life balance could be improved. After you get to the OPS level you may as well forget about seeing your family because they own your time.The training you receive as a manager is figure it out as you go.The benefits are decent and the pay is about average for an area manager. The people you work with are great. The hardest part is the stress level and nonstop fast paced inverment.
good,"Bastante circulación de gente, tanto clientes como personal. En general buenas experiencias."
good,Walmart has a great insurance. Great co workers. Would still be there but the management needed help. Would also have to stock shelves and help customers if no cars to work on. I was hired as an AUTO TECHNICIAN.
good,Walmart is changing overall. They used to have the highest tech to pharmacist ratios and were generous with pharmacist hours. Now they are following other stores models. They are cutting hours and staff as well as benefits. They aren't hiring at anything more than 72 hours and rumors say soon the max will be 64 per pay period. I worry about my hours being cut and as a single parent still paying student loans I can't live off any less than the 64 hours I'm at now. I made it through this round of cuts but what about the next? Its still better than the competitors though. We get lunches and more techs for now. They also are very strict when it comes to compliance.
good,"always had something to do, was always working the customers personally, you had to know where everything was in the store because there was always customers in your department wanting to know WHERE"
good,"We work as a team which is so perfect."
good,They don’t take care of employees all that well it could be better. But I enjoyed working there. But am ready to move on to better my life as a person.
good,It was good pay but at the time it was a fairly new store and everything was very hectic. I'm sure things are different now that they have been open a little longer.
good,Walmart isn't a bad company to work but at one point hours were being cut and I needed more hours/money. I left Walmart and got another job due to hour issues
good,"everyone is lazy, company wants to save customers money so much they are not willing to spend anything. Company advertises a career with advancement but they don't tell you that their managers are required to work 14+ hours a day."
good,I loved working there at first. It was a good work environment and the associates there were very friendly and helpful. Some of the managers there also very helpful and understanding.
good,Wal-Mart in the end is about Wal-mart. Personally was on leave for medical reason and I was called in and asked if I could resign form my employment or they would have to fire me and not get my leave cashed out to me. Walmart's higher management is not friendly and at times not easy to approach to talk with.
good,I worked here for 4 years and was never given the opportunity to move up. I tried multiple time to move from my deli position but even though I was a hard worker that never missed and went above and beyond my duties they would not let me out of the deli
good,Es un buen trabajo puntuales con los pagos buenas polizas lo malo es el salario realmente bajo
good,Walmart overall is a good job experience for me. I enjoy working with co workers and I strive to get the job done. only problem I've had was with some management that expect everyone else to work hard yet they do not have the same work ethic. job requirements didn't equal what we were paid either.
good,"It was a good job to work at the time. The customers was my favorite part of each day. I was always happy when a customer needed my help, ready to assist them"
good,"My overall work experience was fine, however I had several issues with a member of management trying to impress her superiors and overworking the members of my department"
good,"My typical day at work would start by carrying, lifting deli products, cook in the oven and sell to costumers. I learned in Wal-Mart different strategies in making sales. But unfortunately the management I am under has different opinions compared to mine. THe workplace is just okay. The hardest part of the job is the lifting of boxes of deli products. THe most enjoyable part is interacting with the costumers."
good,"For 4 years, I've been a cashier with a great customer service, fast and friendly. "
good,Overall  Wal-Mart  is ok to work for. I'm just ready for a change. It is very  stressful  sometimes and other times  it's not. I love working with people in general and  there are a lot of  different  personalities that I come across
good,"Overall, the company is not the best to work for, nor is it entirely the worst. A typical day of work is usually tiring and stressful. I'm generally an anxious sort of person, so I was often worried about dealing with an unruly or outrageous customer or a manager that was lazy or in a bad mood. On a full shift, you get three breaks, two being 15 minutes long and an hour lunch. Often times the breaks would be late or unevenly spaced (for instance: first fifteen being an hour after you arrive, lunch two and a half hours after that, last and hour and forty-five after lunch had concluded). The customers are frankly worse than the management. It's not unusual to hear about someone who had left feces on the floor or someone holding up checkout lines or someone getting incredibly angry or frustrated. Sometimes it's not the customers' fault either, some of the employees are rather nasty or rude. I didn't learn much, other than the fact that dealing with a thousand people each day is stressful. The most difficult part of my job was monitoring for theft. Often times it's hard to notice whether or not someone is attempting theft. When you can confirm they are attempting to steal, it's difficult to confront them and say that their items weren't scanned properly or the machine didn't pick up. The most enjoyable part is the fact we have breaks and an hour lunch, though it goes by fast. Some customers are very pleasant to talk to as well."
good,Walmart is a great place to work but when there’s not enough hours it makes life a little tough. The ratio of work to get done and employees to do the work is seemingly impossible at times. And we all go under appreciated.
good,way way to many changes were made in the only 3 years ive been there. what I have learned from Walmart is you are not allowed to stick up for yourself and when you try to the managers don't listen !!
good,Learned new skill of retail.  Standing long periods was hard.  Good part time job but alot of turnover as I don't think they appreciate their employees in order to want them to stay.
good,Realistically it’s walmart. You know what you’re going to get when you work here. The people are a bit crazy and graveyard shift is nuts. The compensation was decent for what I did.
good,"Wal-mart hands are tied as far as letting people go.  Their turn around is so high, they need to keep bodies.  To me this is bad for business.  They have an annual across the board raise, which isn't good for the people who really bring their best everyday.  Someone who gives 50% is given the same raise as someone who brings 100%.  It creates tension.  The good thing about the place is you never have to worry about layoffs, and they have outstanding benefits.  I think this is why people are afraid to leave."
good,It's  an alright job for beginners when your looking to gain experience as far as a forever job not so much. The pay is ok but it isn't enough to live off nowadays and the management is terrible poorly managed.
good,The work load is constant and can be a bit overwhelming at times but once you get use to it it's not as bad as it may seem. Management can be unrealistic while trying to accomplish tasks. I really enjoyed stocking and the laid back atmosphere. Managers are pretty understanding when it comes to scheduling. Employees meeting customers needs can be very lackluster and come off annoyed as if it's not there job to assist you.
good,"Everything at Walmart was fast-paced yet had a relaxed feeling to the work on the Cap team. However, with some tasks not being designated to specific groups or people, it could get stressful having to bounce back and forth between tasks and watching time."
good,Managers aren’t qualified for their positions and know very little about the areas they work in. Associates are treated like garbages. Never can plan a weekend of fun because you don’t know what day you will be forced into work.
good,"Buena experiencia, crecimiento en el ámbito personal y trató social"
good,Mostly assisted customer in that department i was assigned to for the shift. Kept area neat and clean. Assisted co-workers when needed. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was climbing on the ladder to get items off the top shelves.  The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers to make their shopping experience good. Happy customers don't mind returning.
good,"As and ASM you have no work-life balance with this company. You are expected to be there all of the time. This includes every single holiday. IT was absolutely a rewarding experience, but I want more time with my daughter."
good,"During my time at Walmart, I've encountered amazing coworkers, managers, and customer. I've also seen the shuffling of management, the apathetic team of coworkers, and being ignored by management."
good,"Typical day included, stocking, backstock organization, customer service, and usually dealing with some sort of angry or impossible customer."
good,"was a fun place to work for a part time job  hours was good ,people was nice and have the chance to move up in the company  would be a bad full time job"
good,Llegas checas. Y a trabajar. Luego a comer y si ellos quieren te quedas tiempo extra . si no te quedas se desquitan en tu eccalucion de cada mes
good,I had a wonderful assistant manager to work under.  She encouraged me to seek my goals and became my mentor.  I had a good overall experience there.  :)
good,"I started as a cashier, worked my way up to health and beauty and then into vision center... where I flourished and was given the opportunity to enter an apprenticship."
good,Don't like how fresh area is one combined area no longer separate new people coming in are not trained for the area other than watching computer based learning programs(cbl) management are not properly trained either too many managers that are all over the board not really there do not take 3nough interest in to learning about a giving area and the proper way things are to done in that area such as raw foods with cooked foods temp of food
good,I believe that my experience at Wal-Mart was too short for me to say that I didn't enjoy my time there. However I still remember the kind staff that was there and I remember all the hard work we put into that place. The store that I worked for was small compared to others but we tried our to have the store ready for customers so they could enjoy their shopping experience.
good,Walmart overload little people meaning they employee managers and management feel and think they are better than others that are Lower position than them.
good,"Trabajo en equipo con buen ambiente, realizar mis actividades correspondientes de acuerdo a mi turno en tiempo y forma"
good,"Each manager I encountered was rude to me. They had no respect for any of their workers. And when I asked for more hours, they denied me and cut my hours instead."
good,"Walmart has been good to me the majority of the time, but they have several issues they need to focus on and address to keep employees happy. Management fails to train all associate's appropriately."
good,Definitely wasnt a career for myself. Some managers were mean or hard to work with but others were the opposite. I guess it really just all depends on where and with who at walmart to enjoy it or not.
good,"Everyday was busy, which is fine. Learned communication and customer and management skills. Hardest part of working there were the managers and customers. Customers always finding ways to get free things. Management constantly screaming and cursing at their employees, not giving them the encouragement needed. Doctor's notes not being a proper excuse for calling off, and it being counted against you. "
good,There are always things that need to be done but not enough help to get them accomplished. Employee turnover is high which doesn't help. Management is strict.
good,"Like any place of business, there are good days and bad days. Retail can be extremely stressful, especially during certain times throughout the year. Business can vary through the year."
good,"If you never have any tardies or absences you can make it at Walmart.  You basically have to have perfect attendance.  And always an employee there should find a way to document your clock ins and outs and find a way to prove them because if you get fired they erase your schedule so there is no way to compare the accusations against your past schedules.  The people they choose to hire, at least while I was working there, can end up being great friends, which is what I miss the most, my people...and I always enjoyed the customers too..."
good,"The hardest part of the job was trying to get all your tasks done on a two truck night on your own but for the most part, all the work was fairly manageable. Management knew the best placements for the crew to make the night go as smoothly as possible. If you were willing to learn other jobs, they were more than willing to let you learn so that you can be of help in more than one area. Everyone was pretty close knit and generally were willing to help each other to make the night go by smoothly so that we could all leave on time together."
good,long days and long hours. no work life balance. too much micromanagement. is getting harder to get promotions since the company is eliminating some of the higher levels positions
good,Defiantly a job for younger person.  Some managers had a god complex.  I was hired to be a cashier and expected be a Sales Associate for Garden Center as well as stock shelves in Beauty and Grocery departments.
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es buena , solo que los sueldos son bajos"
good,"There is a lot to learned in the company, what I like the most working for Walmart was the engagement we had with the Associates and with the customers.."
good,Relaxing work place if you're on overnights. The coworkers are nice. Management could be better. Mainly work alone in an area scheduled and then move around to help others after you're done.
good,"Can't be forced to stay past your schedule, was often told not to leave till something was done.  Rumors going around about someone, don't bother telling management."
good,Managers expect everything to be done at a set time and when it isn’t you are held accountable and threatened to be coached. If you finish your work early it’s almost like you’re punished with more work and you’re rarely acknowledged for working hard.
good,Although it was a good company to work for Walmart lost its culture and its roots to the Customers and the Employees. People used to be valued over the money and the politics.
good,"Scheduling not for everyone, in order to move up in company must relocated, schedule changes with no notice, very production driven, distribution center extremely hot in summer."
good,"fun , fast  paced, meet and greet people, sometimes deal with irate customers, steady work, hard to get  off around the holidays, very busy majority  of the time"
good,"A parte mais agradável do trabalho era seus funcionários, cobranças exacerbadas sobre equipe enxuta"
good,Always on a time limit for everything and if you didn't finish a task assigned to you within a given tim some managers would Coach you or sit down and talk to you the hours weren't consistant having to be there until 8 or 11 at night and come in between 6 to 8 in the morning and they say they're weeks work your end up working up to 8 days straight sometimes at most it would usually be 5 days straight with one day off if you were lucky maybe 2 off
good,"Mucho nepotismo en la empresa, el cliente es primero pero sus trabajadores no valen nada"
good,It was a slow pace and really good place to work at if you have school. The management there is okay and was really neat to work there. I would go back.
good,I loved my job here but at the store I worked there was no respect given from upper management. They talked down to people over the walkie for everyone to hear which is what eventually lead me to look for another job.
good,"its like high school over again, you have to build alliances in order to get on someone's team.  if not employees and management will turn on you. and find any reason to fire you.  and if you want to learn to do other things in the store to further advance, if they didn't like you they wouldn't bother to teach you."
good,"Collaborative Workplace"
good,Walmart ensured that I got enough hours my salary was just low although this company provides you with the tools you need to advance within the business.
good,"They pull you in with the 'high' pay rate but when the math is said and done, you are making about $13 per hour. Work day is based on volume. Having said this, pay consistently fluctuates and is hard to budget around if its not during the business season (tax and holiday time). Management is hit and miss. Sometimes they have well trained managers and coaches, and other times they don't seem to know anything but the basics. There also seems to be a favorites system in which those who pull beyond production levels are treated with more entitlements and favors than those at production or those who fall in between. As an order filler, you are trained in what's called ""green zone lifting"". This is basic knowledge on how to properly lift objects of heavier weights. However, even with these techniques, the amount of lifting done in the time of the shift is well beyond the normal capacity in which most cannot sustain for any prolonged amount of time. The pay does not make up for the amount of bodily stress that one has to endure nor the risk of serious, debilitating injuries that can occur."
good,A place where the customer is put first and employees must be very flexible with learning new positions and covering others. The environment could use some work as employees often missed a happy ambiance.
good,Walmart was a good place to experience lot of customer service as a department head was able to learn all the technical stuff about retail and managing associates.
good,Walmart is a Walmart... computer does the schedule so your working hours sometimes are not predictable. You can tell them your availability and still sometimes your are not on schedule.
good,Wal-Mart is your typical retail store. It has its ups and downs with working for the company. Every store is different. The advantage of Wal-Mart is the base pay has been increasing for every associate.
good,"Days as a cashier are variable, usually overloaded. Management is friendly, but there are too few of them to help with everything. Really, all I've learned is that I am barely capable of dealing with the emotional demands that this job requires, and angry customers are not helpful. However, I do like when I am praised for my kindness and service."
good,"The first store I worked in was a great experience. Management was working together and communicating. Unfortunately, I agreed to transfer. Big mistake. Management has no desire to make the store better, and employees are constantly promised promotions and then not given them.I believe a desire to improve problems would help this store greatly.  "
good,"As a salaried employee at Walmart there is no work life balance, especially around retail holiday season.  The hours are ridiculous and management wants it to be your first priority.  The pay is good for entry level and new grads.  Not recommended for people with small children."
good,"long days.                                                                                                                                       .                      ."
good,Working for Walmart was quite the experience people are so nice but others were mean so I enjoyed working for Walmart when I was working there. Some management was not paying attention as much as they should to there employee but some of them actually conversated with me and the rest of the crew we had a meeting every week all of us in the back with Management in the store manager they talk about the store how it's progressing and they also talk about what we can do to make sure the ratings of the clean fast and friendly stay up. So working for the store my responsibilities were to sweep the entire store make sure all the vestibules look good and no trash laying in the parking lot so if it wasn't for me and other day maintenance that store probably would have not survived the clean fast and friendly ratings so working for Walmart was good
good,The Walmart I was working at was a very nice place to work at first but then I got stuck working with this guy that was doing stuff that were against the Walmart code of conduct and every single time I went to the management they would not do anything about it instead of firing they talked to him all 6 times and nothing changed
good,"The hardest part of the job would be dealing with management."
good,"Upper management doesn't appear to care as much as they could or had in the past."
good,"I pretty much loved my job at wal-mart, my management was horrible and the fact that you can't take off on Thanksgiving or Christmas was a huge downfall."
good,"I worked at 2 different stores, and another store on occasion. I found that policies and procedures are not followed most of the time in 2 out of the 3 stores I worked at. Patient care and safety were a main focus in one store, but at the other two, not as much. The original store I came from we were taught to follow policies and procedures to the letter; it was black or white, no gray areas allowed. You either followed them or you didn't, there was no maybe. Working in a pharmacy is hard work. It's not just slapping a label on a bottle like most people think."
good,"In contact with all types of people, communication and customer service skills play a huge part in the everyday workplace. You can be cross trained into almost any department if you are willing to learn"
good,"If you are supporting yourself,Wal-Mart is not the place to work. I was not able to make ends meet working there. There was also too much turn-over in my supervisors. I worked there about 6 months and I had 4 direct supervisors. As soon as I learned how my boss wanted things done, they would be replaced, and I would have to start all over again."
good,"It was okay, Not alot of room to move up. There wasn't alot of order in the front end. It seemed like nobody really knew what they were doing. The apparel section was better though. You had your own tasks & also you were there to help assist customers. It was always changing."
good,"Work was fast paced and often felt understaffed-- there was a lot to get done all the time. Even during training, there were often times when a manager was needed and did not make themselves present."
good,I knew coming in that the job might be temporary. I was hire to help remodel the store and stay a few weeks after to help stock overnight. I was just not lucky enough to be asked to stay. Might be because I was the only one of the crew to get injuried.
good,Walmart is great place to work if you are you and goin to school at the same time. If you want to make it a career then get into management quickly an move your way up the ladder.
good,"A typical day at Richmond Walmart starts by clocking in and going to the meeting to see if you'll be doing your job as hired for or filling in for a lack of coverage, which is a daily occurrence."
good,"Company still needs to improve on all levels of associates well being"
good,the store is based on a retail management. Every holiday the management team dress up and give away candies and some other stuff witch i had to be invloved. that was the most uncomfortbale place to be for me.
good,Walmart has gotten away from how it use to be ran . They are changing everyday and way to fast. I wouldn’t recommend Walmart to anybody at this time unless things change..
good,work at the distribution center is physically difficult and the wal-mart struggles to find hard working employees who can do the work. This makes it difficult for us that work hard and do a good job want to stay. I'm looking for something with a better environment.
good,It can pay well and can give good benefits but at the same time u can be directed by the mangers and also be belittled by them but if u need the money then forget all that and just work
good,Be careful what you say and do. Never do anything that you wouldn't do if you were just a normal customer and not an employee. Don't yell or use any sort of language or tone that can be seen as offensive.  Always get proof of your completed tasks so that you cant be blamed for something. Make sure you go to every break you have at the exact time you are supposed so you dont get in trouble regardless of how busy your department may be.
good,Cashiers strive to work together despite unbalanced schedule. Referring to inefficient staffing or over staffed. Floor managers are stretched job duty wise and are not always available to assist cashier when need stat.
good,"Pay is good but that is all that is good. Hours are inconsistent, long hours one day short hours the next. Limited time off, Not climate controlled.Hot in summer, cold in winter. Management shows favortism on job assignments."
good,"Lots of work and the machines were always broken are breaking down.  breaks were rushed and unpaid, food in cafeteria was too expensive and management didn't ever have the answers to any questions"
good,I Started at Walmart while I was going to school and when I was done with school I just continue to work there. It is a good place to get your foot in the door and move up quickly if you want too
good,It is hard to advance in Northland Walmart. Job security is good in that there are employees that have been there for over 15 years. Staff are friendly but the management in uncaring for staff.
good,"It gets too personal there. Its hard not to get too invested in the time and stress there, it wasn't where I'm supposed to be. The people are awesome though :)"
good,Depending on your Walmart your experience may differ. Overall pay is good and you’ll have some good hours. Getting along with people is good. Managers may suck depending on who you have.
good,"Pay isn't bad for what you do but having to put up with management and a poor excuse of scheduling, you'll need to have a good amount of patience to stay aboard."
good,"A typical work day involves working freight and providing good customer service.  I have learned that I need about three more of me.  I love my managers, but find that the communication from the store manager to myself is a lot like the telephone game and the translation gets twisted.  The culture at Walmart is quite diverse changes from day to day.  The hardest part of my job is not always having the equipment needed to complete my tasks.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the friendships made and the loyal customers.  Also, seeing positive results of at the end of a long day."
good,"This was my first job so the experience of working retail is whats important. As an electronics associate you are doing a little of everything stocking, helping people, answering questions about laptops, TV's, phones, etc."
good,"For me Walmart was a part-time job alongside college. The employees for the most part seemed very friendly. However the management always messes up everyone's schedules. I constantly have to tell them to fix mine over and over till they do it, and then they mess it up later on."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customer.  Getting to know the regulars and knowing what they come in for and helping them find what they need.
good,"Pay was decent and coworkers were friendly."
good,"I've definitely had many worse jobs, but I've also had a couple that were better. The turnover is high for a reason. They pay better than a lot of places now at Walmart, but the work environment is exhausting. Never before have I felt more like I was expected to complete my duties, ""with or without reasonable accommodations"". You're expected to work hard, work fast, and get everything asked of you done in your 8 hour shift. Regardless of the changing everyday conditions of your job.Trying to communicate properly with management about scheduling issues, faulty equipment, lack of resources and other problems on the job can be confusing, tediously drawn out, and rather stressful."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of managing the lines at the checkouts, handling customer complaints, and completing all of my tasks even when short staffed. The hardest part of the job was having no coverage ever. Management did not seem to enjoy helping the Customer Service Managers, mainly because we have more knowledge about the registers and the store policies than they did. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers and doing everything that I could to help them leave happy and satisfied. I learned a lot about responsibility, patience and understanding, and how to handle upset customers. I also learned a lot about how registers, cash machines, and computers work."
good,"Overall this was a good job especially since it was my first job while attending college yet, I always had problems with my schedule, and I was a student for most of the time. Their training for pharmacy staff is bad. I feel they should completely change the training and not place too much limit of technicians while in the pharmacy concerning wallets, and types of drinks to drink during your shift (we can't take anything but water to drink throughout our shift in the pharmacy, and nothing bigger than a basic water bottle size)."
good,Walmart is an unattractive job in terms of the job description and demanding hours but has a lot of great managers and coworkers. I mainly worked for the pay to help with college. I didn't learn much at Walmart unlike my other jobs but I believe it brought out the best in me and taught me a lot of life lessons.
good,Easy job sometimes. Wear sunscreen if you're a cart pusher I didn't and got horribly  sunburnt. Management lacked in some areas. Low pay for hard work.
good,"Walmart has interesting people that range from the kind hearted to the cold blooded. I honestly don't think they care about the individual employees. They are, face value, to customers, good people but I've seen such cold hearted natures to individual employees and they were so quick to cut the throats of those trying to maintain two jobs. Its a good job for higher ups and maybe people who are starting but for those looking for a career must be ready to go through hardships. If you are lucky you will have a kind and understanding supervisor. As for the daily work, it is fair and understandable. Though if you were to get sick for long periods of times I can assure you that it will be extremely difficult to get around it, because the system implemented is strange."
good,The people you work with are going through the same things you are and you become very close to them.  Their absentee point system is not conducive to real life.  They are very understanding about any health condition.
good,"Battling Amazon, this is the most hectic time to enter. The company is currently battling to keep up with Amazon and things are changing and people are being thrown to the waste side."
good,Well a regular day at work I would unload trucks first. Then after the truck we would go to grocery receiving and work on the frieght over there. Then when we finish the grocery receiving side we do GM side and work on that side. Then pull fresh frieght to the proper departments. I learned that this Walmart job was a easy one. What made it more difficult is when the customers get rude and the employees. We had a manager for a long time then they switched him to another store but then we didn't have no manager all we had was supervisors. The hardest part of the job was the black Friday sales. I enjoyed this job until everything started getting so bad.
good,"As someone who is very outgoing and optimistic, working so closely with the public was never an issue. However, let it be known that it is not uncommon to run into a customer who is stressed or having a hard day. It's important to be able to build a connection quickly and have a desire to make every person leave the store a little happier. This job is definitely meant for a specific type of person."
good,Walmart is a great company but depending on your managers you will either enjoy it and work hard or just decide to quit because of all the pressure they put on one person unfair treatment and double expectations  given to associates and leaders
good,"I would consider Walmart my first REAL job because it was the first time I had a job where I was going almost every day of the week and actually being trained. It was an enjoyable time, believe it or not. The only issue I had was with the management. They don't really take your side in disputes with customers and that lack of loyalty makes you not want to stay"
good,"Pays well above most retail Jobs, Just loses it when it comes to scheduling you all hours and days no consistency. Management turnover very high so lack of direction."
good,"its not a bad job just not for me anymore, all of the rules have changed, the managers have changed, you have to work every holiday with base pay. its not for everybody."
good,"I wish I could say better things about Walmart. Some of the people are friendly. Really, its a good job for someone that is just starting out in the world. You would get a good grip of what people are like. The hardest part if the job is catching up after a busy day"
good,Wal-Mart has treated me well. I can ask off days in advance and accumulate a lot of paid time off. It's retail and retail isn't fun so oh well. Nothing much else to say.
good,I was not pleased with my ex co-workers or management team. This could of been a fun and productive place to work but the store manager was very unprofessional and rude.
good,"Organizing toys has been my bread and butter. However, when asked for something outside of my zone, I couldn't figure it out. Good thing I had to find another associate in the store help me out. But having to hear the cries and screams in children brings me nothing but discomfort in my job."
good,"Es una empresa que busca cuidar a sus empleados, darles calidad de vida , pero a nivel gerencia NO."
good,"The company's culture is fading out with new management coming from Amazon and UPS. Due to re-structuring , it is more difficult to obtain work-life balance. Once you obtain necessary skills to perform your job, it can be easy to work there. They have good benefits and educational advancement courses for employees."
good,Working as a cashier at Walmart wouldn't have been so bad if management actually took their jobs seriously. Morale suffered greatly because of this...
good,Overall Walmart is a super company the pay is a store manager was very good depending on what state and what area you were. Benefits or above standard I do believe but the job's itself very stressful long hours upper management not always committed to helping you and your job more committed to ensure that if you make mistakes they find them rather than helping you with mistakes I believe that's due to the turnover that is caused in Walmart because they in their management and specially district managers are more concerned about putting people in place of their picking and not people that are deserving to be in place my experience at Walmart working in several different states and was several different managers and district managers it's not the same in every area certain individuals run things the way they choose and not always the way Walmart wants them to Sam was a great man and he be very disappointed with the way things are run today otherwise it's a good company
good,"Its ok job. It pays ok, on your about 8 hours of the day. Management is good at what they should be doing. The hardest part of the day is getting started."
good,"A good manager is often the difference between a good experience and a terrible one; were it not for the vigilant shift managers at our location, that store probably would have been an unstocked mess even considering what a busy location we were in!"
good,It was a Friendly environment. Everyone did their jobs and worked hard to make the customers happy. The benefits were adequate and the pay was acceptable.
good,Need to let you be more flexible and give more money for the work you do. Never have enough help on your job or the right tools to complete  you job. Managers are helpful some of the time
good,"It was a good first job for me, I honestly believe I would have stayed there working if it wasn't for the inappropriate conduct of some of the other employees. It's fast paced and hard to get anyone's attention for help, and training is very basic, meaning there is basically none."
good,I've worked at several locations the management team makes or breaks a store. Asset protection is optimal as it removes you from the regular management team which will be awesome if they are bad. Anywhere else if you have good management it's great other wise its either okay or terrible.
good,"Workplace varies by coworkers. Company is bad. They try to cut costs by keeping employee count low, regardless of demands, and wages near minimum. Even employees of several years or decades barely make more. To become management, a person needs to either work themselves to death or be dishonest and underhanded."
good,"*Clock in and get all required gear (ie) radio, keys, schedules etc needed for the days work"
good,It’s a okay job for your first job. The management is kinda of poor. They have you work first shift break packs. It’s kinda low pasted. The managers have favorites
good,The job culture and management were both unorganized. The hours were flexible with no overtime. Medium work load not including the holidays. Cashiers got paid less for more work
good,I have learned to have a thick skin working for this company. Recently I have learned not to put my eggs in one basket. I believe that the company has lost their family culture and appreciation for their long time employees.
good,It is a fairly entertaining place to work. You don't have to be there super early or late. The job can be fun depending on workmates and customers. Really hot or cold depending on the season.
good,"It was a learning experience. There were rude customers and there were nice customers, but making the experience pleasant for all is mandatory. Other employees were friendly, some were helpful. They sort of understand mental health care. I enjoyed talking with new people, the customer base is a diverse demographic so you get to experience many different cultures. Its a good day when you make others laugh and smile."
good,working here was not fun at all forced to do way more work . than what was required of the employees 1 employe to an entire department.was very stressful
good,Wal-Mart is a great job for someone who trying to get work experience. I remember them helping me become a better employee while I was with there company.
good,"While Walmart can be a great place to work for someone who is older, it is definitely not the place for a teenager to work. I was hired there at the age of 18 and worked 1-10 while doing countless hours of overtime because we were not allowed to leave until all task was complete in our departments. Really overworked for the rate of pay that I received and I barely had a social life because on my off days all I wanted to do was sleep from being so exhausted."
good,It was kinda slow when i first started but picked up around certain times of the year. My supervisor was no good only liked people who hung out with him outside of work
good,"It was a very busy job, and you had to stay on top of your job. Had to keep track of the carts that were being sent to customer service because we had to replace anything from them carts that belong in our section. It wasn't as bad of a job sometimes it was a lil less busy and relaxed but most of the time things were very all over the place."
good,Finest people to work with at low level employment--management is a bit sketchy from time to time--overall good people tho.  I enjoyed the people that i met at Wal-Mart.
good,"There are moments where working here is good. A lot of coworkers are nice and it’s not a super hard job to be at. But since hiring new people, hours are getting cut and it’s hurting people who need them. I get everyone needs to be scheduled reasonably but at the same time they don’t have to hire as many people as they have been. It’s hurting a lot of people and their pay."
good,"Walmart Cashier is a great job for someone just starting out in the workforce and provides essential job skills like teamwork, sense of urgency, and communication. It provides flexible hours and additional hours. The best part about is it one can easily get a day off even when scheduled for work because shift swapping policy."
good,"Working here was a lesson learned. I didn't mind my coworkers we all helped each other out but the management was terrible. Also, I was a college freshman at the time and could only have certain hours and they promised me fair hours at the beginning but they gave me whatever hours they needed me, so it effected my school work. Hardest part was the holidays only because it's a retail environment. Most enjoyable part was the photo lab. For one of my first jobs it was okay, but I wouldn't want to make this a permanent job."
good,Fast work place would have a time frame to finish our tasks. I would recommend someone to work here but they would have to make sure that they don’t mine being away from family.
good,"never got enough hours for any type of insurance. when a family member takes ill, its not their problem. if you have issues going on outside of work, they bosses dont want to hear about it, you better be @ work. i had to take several days off in a row to keep an eye on my dad @ home, while my mom worked, & the boss(es) didnt care. i was eventually let go because of their point system. working over night, my mom wouldnt get home until a certain time, i couldnt leave my dad by himself, but the boss(es) didnt care that that was an issue."
good,"Management is not that helpful when it comes to situations and helping you out but besides that, the place was great to work at. Your opinion just does not matter to the higher up people in the company. I love helping customers with bringing soil to their cars or just helping them in general. I learned that you need a good manager in order to feel wanted if not you just feel used. The hardest part of the job for me was ringing on the cash register since I am anxious around other people as in customers and I get stressed out quick since I am not that quick on a register."
good,way underpaid not a good wage for my living cost not even enough to pay my rent. you get full benefits but it gets costly. job security is nice i guess.
good,Just too hot good people though they provide water and 1 Gatorade a day just really hard to want to go to work as a cart attendant when it is so hot outside
good,"The company wants people who are not free thinkers, even at the salaried level of management. I was hired and promoted for my skills but when an attempt to apply those skills was in play they only wanted specific direction to be followed. Plenty of ways things could be done but if it was not strictly by their direction you are wrong."
good,"Overall it's not a bad job, just start the day unloading a truck and stocking for hours. Very friendly co workers. Management team was not the best at all and in fact they all played favoritism with certain people others they would be really strict on."
good,A typical day at work is setting task for Associates fill endcaps and Side corners for the remainder of the day. I also have to cover for csm's in front end for there Lunch breaks. I've learned a lot from Walmart from the Customer Service to Customer Courtesy. How to be fair and treat people how I want to be treated. The Hardest Part of the job is the stress of dealing with uncooperative management with peer pressure to push associates instead of motivate them to achieve even higher goals and enjoy there Job. The most enjoyable part of the job at Walmart is to me the customers. I've have learned and gained more social skills here than I have anywhere I've worked and for that I am thankful.
good,"Doing more work, for the same pay as the rest of the store. I would unload trucks, sometimes 2 (3 during Christmas) in a few hours then we would have to stock most of what we unloaded."
good,"At Walmart, a typical day of work is very challenging.  You learn new skills but, management was not really friendly back then.  The open door policy sometimes is not followed.  The hardest part of the job is to deal with customers who are trying to take advantage of the system. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing it right."
good,"I worked for the WMGTS India PVT. Ltd which is a Walmart Global eCommerce entity. There are many Walmart entities in India and this is a software development/testing center. "
good,"After working within that atmosphere for close to a year and a half, It became apparent that this was something I couldn't see myself advancing with the knowledge and skills I know I am capable of."
good,"Everyone would pitch in to help, employees were friendly and job focused. Enjoyed customer relations and helping folks out. The management tended to be very helpful and approachable."
good,"When you work at an Academy store, the expectations are higher than normal. You are expected to not only know your job, your position and your product; but you are also expected to help teach all the info to other associates when they visit the store for training."
good,"You get cheap prices on products, they try to staff as best they can with their budget. Not an awful place to work, not a fantastical adventure either."
good,"I am fairly new to Walmart, but from what I have seen so far my store lacks structure. They also tend to be very unprofessional at times. Overall they have room for improvement."
good,"I would stage items and put them in inventory. I would go pick groceries for people who ordered hem online, bag them up and bring them to their cars, and load them up."
good,"I didn't hate it here. I hated some of the people I worked with, but I mean, that's anywhere really. They  tend not to follow scheduling policy and some days you can work 8,9, even 10 days in a row before getting a day off. But otherwise, not the worst place to work."
good,a very busy day. it requires fast face so that you can finish your job. fun to be with co worker when working together. and chating during breaktime. you can learn a lot if working nighttime
good,"walmart was okay, management sucked. they don't care about their employees, nor take any suggestions seriously. given, they are vastly overworked so i could understand."
good,Overall Walmart is a great workplace. You receive enough hours and they pay well. We work as a team to get the work we need to get done in order for our customers to have a great shopping experience and get everything they came in for.
good,"Regular associates are nice to work with . Managers and CSM's are overloaded which makes them stressed out and not pleasant.  They raised the minimum wage for employees, bit in order to compensate they took away positions so more work for everyone which is sometimes overwhelming."
good,the company is advancing quick and doing a poor job of ensuring new managers are fully trained for their roles.  new managers are given 2 weeks for training then put in stores not knowing how to execute putting a burden on other managers to pick up their slack. We are told to follow OBW but get told something different from co managers/store managers/market managers/regional mangers leaving assistants to guess what the proper action to take in any given situation. very frustrating
good,My day consisted of putting together various photo orders and helping the electronics department during down time. I learned a lot about photo projects and how they come together. the culture at the job was Okay. There was nice people but also a lot of the workers would hide and not do much work which made it more stressful for the people who were trying to do the job correctly. the most enjoyable part of the job was the longer breaks.
good,This was a job that served its purpose at the time. It worked for me. I met a lot of great people and good customers. I learned more about working in a team environment.
good,Hardest part was removing the boxes out of the truck one by one and finish in a timely manner.  Most enjoyable was the hour lunches. and the some of the people you work with
good,"customers act entilteled and in a hurry, manager sucks, freezer dangoures, no one wants to unload freezer truck"
good,"So I had started working part time at another store then transferred to another store after about 9/10months and was still under part time. So I waited til my one year anniversary to try to request full time to prove my worth that I was worth having full time, well I tried twice and it didn’t happen and got to talking to other people around there and they said they had been trying for a year and still hadn’t gotten anywhere so I just have up on because I wasn’t gonna play their games. Also, cap 2 schedule sucks, don’t do it. You’re there every other day and practically force you to have that schedule or else they mess with you."
good,"The other employees were great, and since the store I was at provided analytics for the employees in real-time we occasionally had fun getting into friendly competitions to see who was faster or more accurate. easily the best part of the job was the coworkers. though upper management did seem very detached from the rest of the employees, they couldn't even keep us all straight. I myself was mistaken for a seasonal and ""let go"" on Christmas Eve without notice despite having been hired as a ""Permanent"" employee"
good,One of my least favorite jobs. I was working while still trying to graduate high school. Which at the time was more important than making money. I was getting sick a lot and they didn't accept doctor notes so I got in trouble for my attendance a lot. Overall I left because school was more important. Also the management wasn't that great either.
good,"If you're fresh out of high school and need a summer job then working at Wal-Mart is a good place to start. But if you're trying to make a career out of it, then good luck. In my store it's very hard to get out of a position that you started in, trying to move up to a manger in my store is not worth it because you are basically  signing your life over to the store manager who will over worker you 60+ hours and you don't receive no overtime because manager's are salaried so your basically working your life away for nothing. I've been behind the scenes in alot of Wal-Mart's and trust me when I say this EVERY WALMART IS NOT THE SAME, meaning working in my store is lifeless and boring but go work in another Wal-Mart and it might be fun and very exciting .. so the job experience differs depending on what Wal-Mart you're working for."
good,"A typical day at work is ringing the customers grocery or other items and bagging it with similar items such as meats in a bag together, dairy products together, etc."
good,"I am friends with a lot of my co-workers which makes it an easy place to work. I find it very fast paced and sometimes very stressful which is alright as the day usually goes fairly quick. I find management very confusing at times and the rules/ guidelines handed down from corporate don't always make sense. I feel there are other, more efficient ways to get a job done but we cannot use that way because it isn't what corporate wants. Overall it seems to be a decent starter job for young adults. You can easily make it your career. For me however, its not my career choice."
good,"Over the years I've worked for the company, the hourly pay rate has increased gradually. The other benefits have reduced at a quicker rate. Insurance premiums have increased, vacation and sick time has declined and work load has been increased. To continue showing growth of the company the associates benefits have been on decline"
good,"This review comes after 7 years apart from walmart. So I can't really say much- indeed says it's required... Hopefully pay has gone up; it was atrocious during my time. Had a new store leader take charge the last month I was there whom was amazing. I wish all leaders were like him. Cared for employees, listened to concerns, acted upon recommendations."
good,"WalMart was a employer that did not care about it's people, their only concerned was being open for business and making money. Their managers do not know what it means to treat all their employees with respect in order for the employees to treat their managers with respect. So I, myself, would tell a person not to work their if they were to ask me about employment."
good,cleaning the parking lot of carts an garbage. I learned that the public isn't respectful.. the hardest part was to keep the store full of cart for the custormers.
good,"It is a good place to work especial part time job."
good,I liked working at Walmart for the better part of a year. It was good to be able to talk to my employees and customers as well to help them. The only reason I would recommend some place else is because the higher up managers Inside the store tend to make the technician look bad
good,"I believe Walmart should accept doctors excuse, I believe employees shouldn't have to worry about losing their jobs due to sickness, I was let go from this company due to being pointed out all because i was sick and was told to stay home and get better then come in and they would take care of it not to worry, then after working almost a full day management called me into the office and fired me"
good,"Working at Walmart is not a horrible job. You can request days off, benefits, and a lot of people interaction. I think i just got handle spiteful people in the work place."
good,It was great job untill 5 years ago they changed mangers and no ideal what they are doing and all older people their where doing all the stuff jobs like tires brakes and clutch’s with no help from lower techs .
good,"Empresa que paga funcionários em dia, com benefícios. Trabalho em grupo e com bons companheiros de trabalho."
good,This was a very detailed oriented job and very fast paced. Every day your mangers stressed to you about how fast paced the job was and how quickly you needed to done with your task.
good,A typical day at work tends to be long and stressful. When management gets in trouble or is having a bad day they tend to think that it is okay to take it out on the employees and make rude commits to the employees about their lifestyle and choices.
good,"It was stressful. Fast paced, and too many managers. They would tell you contradictory orders and rules felt like they changed based on the day. Training was rushed and the vast majority of the things you need to know for the job you either learn on your own, or you just mess up and get punished for it."
good,I greeted customers coming into the store. I assisted each customer the same .Everyone deserves to be treated with the upmost respect and generosity and I treated them with such manners.
good,A day at Walmart could sometimes be very long.  The job was not so much stressful but continued busy with no let up.  Management did make sure you received your breaks.  Most all of the employees were always very friendly.  The hardest part of the job was always being conscious of not doing anything to hurt your back.  I personally had a great  repor with my customers.
good,"Arrancar a las 6 am ordenando el piso de ventas, preparar estrategias de ventas, desayuno con personal a cargo, orden en deposito, lo mas difícil es la relación empleado-cliente. Lo + capacitación, viajes a otras sucursales, festejos mensuales por los objetivos cumplidos."
good,"The other employees were very unhappy at work and it rubbed off on everyone else. Management does a poor job of over-seeing their staff and encouraging their workers. They also do a poor job of recognizing which employees are excelling at their job and which ones are slacking. I was happy to leave Wal-Mart even though they have many job opportunities, it was really this location that I believe was not a great place to work."
good,"Start the day by opening up your register "
good,"Not a career unless you move up, poor pay, no overtime but sometimes they do have bonuses, we did get hour lunches and I got one weekend day off sometimes 8 hour shifts sometimes less ."
good,"Rude, and snotty always with a attitude, lazy. Once people made it to management it was like they could just delegate the work to someone else, rude in front of customers"
good,"Walmart seems to have forgotten the foundation on which it was built. It no longer cares about its associates the way it once did. Salaried managers are well compensated, but you work 50+ hours per week and there is little flexibility in your schedule. The culture isn't what it once was."
good,"Understaffed, inconsistent schedule, inconsistent break/lunchtime. Absentee managers, equipment substandard. Pluses, 32- 40 hours weekly, paid on-time, employee discount."
good,"Depending on the location, you're either going to love Walmart or hate Walmart.  At my location, problems seem to be fixed with bandaids and eventually spiral out of control.  The Store Manager won't speak to associates directly when he sees something wrong, which sets a bad example for the other managers as the standards are being set from above.  The Store Manager will also lie or act like he's in denial when a problem is brought up, offering little to not solution to the table.  It's a very disheartening thing to see when you have a mind set on improving things."
good,Interacting and communicating with customers.  I learned that you need to be patient and caring with all types of people.  The busiest time is during the holidays.
good,"I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with. But the management team and the company itself were the only downfalls. The pay was decent but you had to work for awhile to get a decent pay. Even if the pay was raised, they never gave you enough hours."
good,"With the recent introduction of multiple self checkout machines at my store, the pace of the day has gotten much worse. Corporate is out of touch with the customers and fails to understand that customers will flat out refuse to use the machines and will wait in long lines to check out. This causes a back up in the store and leads to stress on workers. To remedy this, they've cut hours in the hope that less cashiers will lead to more customers being forced to use machines, but that is not the case; they're just waiting in longer lines with more of a reason to explode in the face of the cashier who will then be less likely to want to stay with the company."
good,it was okay but the boss  think hey are gods but i made frends and i got to know my job and i did my job as best as i can but the boss out there want away to much
good,fast  paced job  with  the   focus  on  the  customer  .management   was  good.  co  workers  were  friendly .most  enjoyable  part of  the   job  was being  able  to  help.
good,"Good place to work , but not for everybody . They did give me my set hours and not check your schedule every week to have to see what days and hours you'll work. Thats nice to have that ."
good,"The Customer Service Managers are absolutely terrible. They treat us very rudely, they talk to the customers ridiculously. I currently don’t see how they are still working for Walmart. Customers are always first but the managers are very disrespectful to them. I’m starting to think that some Walmart’s are rigged they need to watch who they hire. Honestly."
good,Need to be able to service people. This is the job for you if you like being around a lot of people and if you are social. You need to be able to handle money well.
good,"Manager of my department was the only reason I left. Yeah, it was stressful, but my coworkers and certain friendly faces made it worth it. Could consider going back."
good,If your looking for something to get by it's really good. But for full time it's kind of hard if you have kids at home. It's good if your going to school or if your retired.
good,The job is really good and fellow coworkers are willing to work as a team to get any and every job done. The company has a few faults with management however the overall work environment is not that bad.
good,Typical department store establishment. Hours are not steady and staffing varies. Job enjoyment contingent primarily on the customers which show up daily.
good,"While at Walmart, I was promoted rapidly due to my drive for success. The location was in a college town, so it stayed busy at all times of the day...."
good,"I worked in an area that was very separate from the rest of the club and even though the club management did not check in and support a lot of events, there was enough support from outside clubs and outside management."
good,Majority of the co-workers were pretty nice people. Management not so much. Expectations are always set way too high. You can never get enough help. It would get pretty stressful during holidays. Management has a serious lack of communication so sometimes its unclear as to what is exactly that they want you to do. There's a lot of structural changing going on with the company at the moment. It can be pretty confusing when you're processes change so rapidly.
good,"Poor managment. Does not care about family or employees health"
good,"Walmart is a good place to work at, its just the management team can have no communication whatsoever with the associates. Also it is hard when some managers show favoritism."
good,"When working at Walmart you are expected to do just that, work. Your pay at the same time is usually quite fair as entry level positions begin at $11 an hour. You will most likely be expected to do work outside your job description depending on absences and flexibility is abaolutely a must. Customers can be grating or even aggressive at times but management is responsible for the significantly more difficult ones."
good,The work was very physical and you are exposed to heat and cold. Management doesn't care about anyone but themselves and are just there to catch people not following all of the ridiculously strict rules.
good,"Area manager. You never know when your day will end. 12-16 hours.  Four or three day work week.  The days you work you have no time for family, exercise and eating healthy all become difficult. You are praised one week and the next you feel your job is on the line.  Upper management walks work area and will not coach employees but will come find you to explain all the issues they saw on the floor."
good,"Empresa favorável para quem procura dinamismo, ação que te prepara a enfrentar muitos obstáculos e atingir os objetivos."
good,Working at Walmart can be stressful but they offer good benefits. I’ve learned a lot in the five years I have been there. Although management may not be on the same page at times it is a good place to work.
good,They like  who they like and if they don't.......Out you go. Mandatory overscheduling during holidays.  This is not a life or family oriented company to work for.  They schedule single mothers during inappropriate shifts and give people with no children day shift.
good,Walmart has many programs that help associates.  Associates thrive through team effort and there is plenty of encouragement to learn all aspects of the business.
good,"As a launching point for a career, Walmart is great – especially if you plan on taking advantage of advancement opportunities. However, if you retain a fair degree of experience outside of the company, then you may be disappointed. On the good side, the company has decent benefits and a relatively informal atmosphere. On the down side, the company’s new “Schedule Right” system is horrible and leaves most associates scrambling for hours. This new system schedules by 15 minute increments and this compounds an already short-staffed environment and forces associates to work erratic hours."
good,"This was several years ago and it was honest job for honest pay.  That is why I took the job.  It was a way to pay bills but usually I was not given my breaks, and was expected to stand for long periods of time ( more than 2 hours)."
good,"Not a terrible place to work, the core of the Walmart culture is amazing but its up to the local management to implement it. the hour break are nice and the amount of food/ snacks that are provided (via non sellable but still edible food)."
good,"El trabajo es agradable, pero hay jefes que tienen falta de experiencia y no son abiertos a nuevas ideas o maneras de realizar las labores de trabajo."
good,"Coworkers willing to help each other to succeed, although management wasn’t heavy on it. Associate were more friendly with each and showed respect for each other as well"
good,"Stock the shelfs, they would push you until you got it done. You had so much time to get your work done. I enjoyed working with people and customers. Was over the front end."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart isn't all that great. the management isn't fair, I feel like they over look certain people. They very rarely allow over time. My CSM assistant manager isn't fair and is kind of rude. I asked if I could get him to fix my points because he and another manager told me I could come in at a different time. When I asked him to fix my points he told me ""no"" because he didn't want me calling out. I am working to get my points to go away so that I could work In only customer service or transfer stores."
good,Everyone basically does their job and the place runs smoothly.  I enjoyed working there.  There is room to move up if you work toward it and would like a career.
good,i cleaned the bathrooms and i would walk around the store and clean up spills. i also would fix thing if i could and with management approval. there was a lot of vomit that i had to clean up
good,"Recommended for part-time job seeking with flexible scheduling. "
good,"More of a temporary job unless you enjoy being treated poorly by management or enjoy dealing with lack of competence from management. Was screwed around with my discount card and benefits that they never ended up providing, even after eight months of employment."
good,"start your day by touring your area,"
good,Selling the products that we sell is the best feeling to have for the customer.  Every day we get the opportunity of filling customers needs and also wants.  the patrons are a diverse population making coming to work pleasant.  the hardest part of the job is convincing the customer what is the best fit for them as far as products go.
good,"The most I liked was interacting with people with different cultures and feeling that you  are part of society as well.The assistant managers who were educated , would know their responsibilities very well and respect anybody."
