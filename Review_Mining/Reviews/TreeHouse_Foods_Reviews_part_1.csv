bad,Terrible place to start a career. Very bad management has new managers coming in and don’t know what to do. Leads and supervisors show a lot of favoritism they are sleeping with hourly associates. Under paid for the job they ask you to do. Somebody’s alway getting hurt. Machine are always broke hours of just standing around very unorganized company.
bad,They don't care about anybody if you are new they'll make you to work 12 hour everyday. If yours child she/he is sick they don't care you will still have to go to work
bad,"Worst place to work, they pay you good but then they end up firing people for no reason at all after a few months. Management is poor and treat people like they don’t matter at all"
bad,Tree house going out no work for the people so they can take care of there Family people have to get part time job try to make it people been working there for a lot year can not make a living there they do not take care of there people how would you feel good or bad or sad. So bad they not in the race and can not catch up
bad,Hot and dirty. When I worked here the turn around rate was very high. People don't like working in such hot dirty conditions. The management is unwilling to help and you feel like your efforts are in vain.
bad,"a lot of drama poor management, there was always something that we did wrong never something that we did right always being forced to stay with out the proper notification"
bad,The whole human resource department has no clue about anything. Getting fmla is next to impossible for most people. They work against you not with you. No place for advancement what so ever. Once your stuck on a line that's it. The minority's take advantage of there group. Once you leave on good terms if you want to go back it depends on if hr liked you or not. Doesn't matter if you were a great worker
bad,Floor leads and management are the most disrespectful people I've come in contact with in any job. The work environment is completely hostile and racially imbalanced. A great deal of attention is paid to non-hispanic minorities who are forced out of their positions or giving an unfair share of the work. You may be told today five minutes before the end of your shift that you expected to work 12 hours no warning no consideration for what you might have to do or plan. You are spoken to like you a small child being disciplined for some horrendous act that you committed. The problem is not the workers the problem is the management the floor leads and HR who turns a blind eye to its staff and their behavior. The job isn't that bad it's just mismanaged micro managed and it's workers taking completely foot for granted. It's a lousy place to work. The pay is good but not worth the aggravation you have to take in order to get it. The plant is closing by April 2017. So anyone starting now should know that is short term don't know about other tree house plants but the Azusa plant the worst job I ever worked anywhere!
bad,This place was horrible! I was a bagger operator on second shift the training was on first shift with extremely unpleasant employees. The temperature was hot and uncomfortable everyday because the ovens are directly behind the production floor. No work on Friday just cleaning! When you report things they retaliate and suspend you for an extra two minutes on break. This place is terrible! No diversity in management.
bad,"Very poor management,  Very poor leadership from supervisors to leads. English is a second language if you don't speak Spanish you're not included in conversations. Supervisors make up their own laws until proven wrong. Supervisors show favoritism towards Mexican race over other people. HR department is about the same very poor in handling things with Employees. If you report something to HR within a week you are in trouble for something  And made out to be the bed guy. Really don't know how I lasted as long as I did..."
bad,"The only good thing about this job was that I was on a set schedule and could see my family, other than that it was a nasty place to work. The boss I had to work for if you were not in his little ""click"" you were guaranteed to not make it through your probationary period, if I would've worked with any other boss I would've still been working there."
bad,"HR department is on the management side."
bad,"people were rude. They didn't train you and would just throw you on a job. Also you had to check your schedule everyday because people would always quit or call off they couldn't even get the temp service to send people, that's how bad it was."
bad,There are some members of management that think that everyone else is stupid and they are the smartest. They will tell such great stories how awesome you are but bottom line when they mess up (and they always do) it will be your fault. No accountability from management and no backing you up when needed. There are some great people I had the chance to work with but unfortunately it wasn't enough to keep me there.
bad,Unless you have the mentality of a nine year old don't bother. Management is clueless and the place is so unorganized they can't get out of their own way. The attitude of the employees is downright childish. Unless you are looking for a place for your career to die stay away. Completely unprofessional top to bottom.
bad,"I don't have anything positive to say about this company. The atmosphere has changed with the past 2 ownerships. The job itself was great, but the company, not so much."
bad,They only hire foreigners because they get a kickback from the taxes it is not right for us Americans that works there. A lot of favoritism a lot of them kiss up to the bosses
bad,"continental shifts, every shifts thinks they're better than the other, Sups and Leads plays favoritism, unions are useless...fun to work for the first 6 months, after that..."
bad,They only hire foreigners because they get a kickback from the taxes it is not right for us Americans that works there. A lot of favoritism a lot of them kiss up to the bosses
bad,Slow production rate  poor  management .  A lot of unfairness... would not recommend to anybody.............................. Was not a pleasure working there........... too much people going on vacation at the same time.
bad,Started out alright then they went through a change and people got screwed out of positions. Then a layoff. Not a stable place to work. Upper management cares about no one but themselves.
bad,"Company’s main priority is to increase stock value for shareholders vs business results. This is being done by plant/office closures and reduction of employees.    Contstant reorganization and terminations at the risk of knowledgeable employees leaving and others struggling with workloads."
bad,"Poor management and advancement comes only from sleeping with upper management or kissing butt (which everyone is aware of and pretends isn’t happening). They don’t value their employees at all, you’re a dime a dozen in this place. They don’t do performance reviews, hold anyone accountable for their actions, or place any corrective action on people who can’t do their job properly. They rush to validate employees, because they have such a high turnover rate that they need validated operators now now now. They beat the life out of intelligent people and those with minimal intelligence get away with whatever they want. You’re smart? Here’s the worst machine possible, fix it. You’re ignorant? Here’s the smoothest machine on the line, stare at it all night and don’t break a sweat. You work hard? Here, have other people’s work to finish. The pay is decent and the insurance is good and that’s the ONLY reason they have employees to begin with. No one in their right mind would allow themselves to be treated the way they treat people otherwise."
bad,"no growth, no respect and absolutely no work/life balance what so ever. mandated to work as you are going to clock out if you say no you get a POINT. NO RESPECT FOR EMPLOYEES"
bad,"Does not treat the employees with respect, act likes it in front of outside management but more concerned about image versus take care of the employees or customers. Like to cross the ""T"" and dot the ""I"" more than doing the right thing. Work over 10 hours a day and paid for 40 hours per week. Poor work life balance and HR doesn't back you up when needed."
bad,"Favoritism and racism are very bad in the maintenance shop, you have to be buddies with the manager or else its over, i needed a job for a little and this held me over, no room for advancement at all"
bad,Don't really like treehouse job was ok ppl management was not all that also they had they favorites pick of people . we was sent home when the nuts was to cold. Then they want u to walk around looking for work forlk lift drivers wouldn't drive ' crushing people feet. Y'all ask ...
bad,Company is struggling with negative culture and direction.  Limited flexibility and virtually no focus on employee satisfaction.  Unrealistic or unclear goals and no support from department leadership.
bad,Great place for pastry and bread but not for so long. Being on managers or supervisor good side will get you places but is never a good thing. they don't listen to employee inputs or suggestion but sure can pick and play favorites especially with the plant's managers and supervisors.
bad,"Sad deal for the people who have been employed here. Was one of the many good jobs left in battle creek, AKA - CEREAL CITY."
bad,"New management changing in the schedules at the last minute, last minute mandatory overtime, mandatory meetings, every week, they do not care about your family at all"
bad,U can find something better then this place. Its adult daycare. U are not treated as an adult. If ur lazy N dont care then this place is for you. Doesnt matter how hard u work they dont care.
bad,"Everybody just does whatever they want to and nobody really has any fears of getting in trouble for it.  Management has no idea whats going on and as long as product keeps being produced they won't care.   Lies, corner cutting, and backstabbing are the norm.  Lots of race politics and he said she said.  pretty much if you don't want to do something you can just wander away and say you forgot.  If its really important they have a really angry jerk of a mechanic they make do it.  so its kind of fun to see him get screwed over.  I'm leaving before he loses his mind one day though."
bad,"Company  was very  unorganized. Very  low moral, upper  management  was not  at  all involved with the day to day operations of what  customer service did.  Work was not  distributed properly at  all. Cross functional departments were  very  rude &  not  helpful."
bad,"I was part of the sale when ConAgra Foods sold the RalCorp division to TreeHouse Foods and it was promised that it would be a more open environment with better transparency. After a year, it seems that they are realizing they bit off more than they could chew. No one in management wants to give anything up, they seem to excel at micro management and have not been any better at information sharing than ConAgra Foods was."
bad,"Management or very poor leaders, they show no compassion for there job, they have a lot of favouritism. Good workers or treated the worst, while the ones that don't work get away with it. I had a incident where me and a co-worker had a disagreement, which he cause the problem. I had been there for nine years, and him only three years, and which I ended up losing my job. I have the company over and above my hold tour with them. I was done very wrong by the company."
bad,Treehouse doesn't care about their employees  they are loosing business  there is mgmt.  that is doing nothing to help the company but they keep their job and employees loose theirs . They aren't trying  and the human resource is not for the employees
bad,Miserable cutthroat management. Co-workers are great. Watch your back. they love to let you know who is the boss and run you down every chane they get.
bad,"The culture of the facility is that you're there to work and when you're not there, you can be called in to work.  Everything focuses on you being at their beck and call.  HR looks out for the supervisors, but cannot get people hired to fill open positions.  Long workdays (12 hours) and you will be required to work Overtime if everything is not 100% complete even if it takes you 1-2 hours more."
bad,"Its very hot in the summertime. The management seems to not care if you pass out on the floor. Wants you to be seen by a doctor, after they tell you to. Then you come back to give them the excuse, and they turn around and say they didn't tell me to. So therefore, I lost my job! Overall, it's not that a great of place."
bad,"very unethical, unprofessional and unorganized place of employment. How it’s good money, it most definitely is not worth risking ones life for and possible legal issues as of all the multiple regulations."
bad,"Treehouse Azusa is terrible,they have too much favoritism and if you prefferably speak english they discriminate against you. Human Resources listen only to what the supervisors say and its usually the supervisors call,the supervisors dont even speak proper english, all they speak is spanish. They try to force you to work 12 hours or cosecutively without a day off for 8-10 days sometimes even longer. This is the most un professional plant Ive ever worked in.Glad theyre closing this place down good job tree house."
bad,Not the best  place to work for but also not the worst. Unfortunately the company closed and left a lot of people unemployed. I felt that corporate could've done a lot more to keep the place running.
bad,"A lot of heavy work, more than 13 hours stopped and very bad pay"
bad,"The upper management believe they are more educated than the people who actually do the work.  And create policies that aren’t in line with getting the job done in a timely manner."
bad,"Win or Lose is the Culture there and when your a Winner every Loser is dragging you Down. For then They dont have to do as much as there Fair share and Just Scrape by.  Losers!!!"
bad,"Needs a major overhaul in staff, from the top down. Reduced hours company wide, due to production loss of orders. Management is made up of non caring individuals, who don't assist, direct, or even listen to staff."
bad,"Honestly all I can say about this company, it that they just took advantage of their workers. Workers, hardly moved up postions, the reason being that, in the warehouse i worked for it was just favoritism, if the supervisors liked you enough or you as the worker just said yes to everything they wanted, then you would ""probably"" get somewhere. They would make you do specific job dutties that you didnt have the title for nor the pay. Majority of the supervisors didn't know what they were doing, and if the supervisor called a shot and managment would get upset they would blame the worker."
bad,TreeHouse requires a foundation for success at all levels of management - their lack of direction and commitment is producing fruitless efforts to improve conditions.
bad,"Poorly managed company, managers would not keep their word.  Spineless manager who would stretch the truth and not back supervisors.  Manager is a discredit ti the profession."
bad,"The work environment is horrible. Employees constantly belittling others, mocking them all day long, even dressing like them to make fun of them. To the point that they are interfering with people's home life & any personal life they may have. Its harrassment charges waiting to happen. A major part of this is because a large number of them are in one family, so they tend to treat others as a less human being ( if they're lucky, mostly talked to like a dog literally)"
bad,"They are working to improve things, but it has been a slow process. Transparency would be good for the employees and could help decrease turnover. Long way to go!!"
bad,"Very clicky management since average age is probably under 40 years old. If you give your opinions it will be met with negativism. If you have other career offers take them! Management not interested in the people. More interested in what the worker can do for me attitude. Fact very high divorce rate amongst employees."
bad,Typically too many chiefs and not enough Warriors management is bad leadership is worse when the labor person meets the numbers or goals management it's the first to take Pride in it's accomplishment in other words they take the credit for the work that you do
bad,Transitioning company and culture reflects it. Work life balance isn't viewed as a priority. Emphasis on head count reduction. Challenging work life with some very good people.
bad,Underpay
bad,"They expect you to work 12 hours a day 7 days a week with one day off every two weeks. Besides that, If you don't work an extended shift on a moments notice you will receive attendance points. Horrible Horrible company management that takes advantage of their workers. The only reason to stay is pay and benefits"
bad,"The job culture is horrible here. The people complain any time they have to do their job, there's no teamwork, and Management does nothing about it. They used to pit the different shifts against each other to see who would perform better and because of this, there's no cooperation between shifts and more times than not, they will leave work for the next shift to do. The people that actually care about the job are left doing more work because they are the only ones that will do the work. Again, management does nothing to solve this. If you are new, expect to work 60+ hrs every week, because the OT is based on seniority and most of the seniors won't take the OT, which forces the noobs to kill themselves for a job that won't get you anywhere. Management won't approve time off when you need it, but they do give you 13 days sick per revolving year.  The only things positive are the benefits and okay pay. If I had to do it all over again I wouldn't work here. The stress of it all makes it almost not worth it."
bad,"Had high hopes when tree house bought us from con agra."
bad,"Quality Assurance is on top of their job along with Sanitation."
bad,Would go to work and get on the forklift and move product to different locations as they were needed. I learned how pasta was made and how to handle the different products that were made.
bad,poor management people who have less of a brain get more move up the ladder of money while others that know are denied to move up unless you love to suck butt that's how you gain more money princeton ky plant is a joke run away as fast as you can at one time when ralcorp owned princeton ky plant every thing was ok now you never know if you're working or laid off two faced ''BACK STABBERS'' always looking for a reason to fire you unless you're rich look else were for employment
bad,The company is stuck in doing things the old way.  No Change.  Did not take feedback.  No interest in streamlining the processes.  Did not value the employees.
bad,"A lot of turnover in the past 2 years.  Upper management is a joke - very ""clique-y"" environment.  The morale around the office was pretty pathetic and disheartening."
bad,"I would not recommend working there if you cannot handle working over time without an advance notice. The people there can be rude sometimes, there is a lot of drama, and management lacks organization."
bad,I was part of the acquisition and they did not realize what they were getting. ConAgra was much more advanced with their employees and processes. Moving to TreeHouse was like taking a step back 10 years. Micro-managing with inept processes. We had experience with the systems and customers and they didn’t want our input at all. Leaving was the best decision I made.
bad,"Does care about the safety of employees, if injured it's your own fault, company won't pay, or give workers compensation. Only care about production, not safety."
bad,Lots of overtime up to 60 hrs a week when busy when not busy lots of layoffs they have 3 shifts 7 lines half hr rotation training not so good not enough trainees
bad,"A rapidly expanding company struggling with modern technology.  Vertical movement is typically rewarded to employees who work late and take on as many projects as possible, rather than overall effectiveness."
bad,Company had no work/life balance. expected to work 12 hours a day and 6days a week. Also needed to be on call on your day off.
bad,Good pay. Bad team leads and supervisors outnumber the good ones. Policies and rules change without notice. New operators are rushed through training and get no support from team mates.
bad,"Leadership is too new, yet too set in their ways. If you’re not part of the “in-crowd” you won’t get far. Current CEO doesn’t seem to have a clear vision to move forward."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for them whether in production or the warehouse,  what works for one group of employees definitely doesn't work for another, the pay was diverse I worked the grave yard shift in the warehouse I started at 1020pm but my graveyard pay didn't start until 11pm since that's when production started, anything after 7 am all of graveyard was paid day shift pay . MANDATORY 12 days on 2 off, all meeting are mandatory"
bad,"When I was hired at Conagra, but now called Treehouse their point system was a mess. I had voicemails saying I didn't have to go in that day and they gave me an occurrence. I was told from my supervisor that I could have a day off without a point and I had an occurrence for that day. I was sick and had a doctors note that I gave to my supervisor and it wasn't turned into the HR office and I got 2 occurrences for two days I missed."
bad,"Great Benefits. Great co-workers.  Management is lacking knowledge and understanding of how to manage the merger. Many employees being laid off in February 2018 due to the merger.  The St. Paul team(Snack Division) has too many ""old timers"" from companies that have merged so there is no understanding of how to move forward.  The culture lacks an employee centered mind set.  They advertise advancement opportunities, but it does not happen.  There has been about 1-2 people leaving a month.  Fulfillment is slow or only with contracted people.  HR is not your friend at this company.  Lack of leadership is everywhere."
bad,The training you get is very poor because they see so many people come and go that no one really wants to take the time because you are probably going to be fired anyway.
bad,"TreeHouse would like to consider itself an organization that has a strategic outlook, yet, at best is is very tactical.  "
bad,Treehouse struggles with organic growth.  They grow via mergers and acquisitions.  One of their most recent acquisitions more than doubled their size.  While struggling to meet their projected numbers they decided to reduce the work force.  I understand this decision from a business standpoint but from a human standpoint it's not good.
bad,"Never know when they're gonna have another layoff, business is based solely on us everyday people buying their product. Would not reccommend as far as this place being job security."
bad,"I worked at ConAgra/TreeHouse for 4 years - since I graduated from college. When I first started, there was huge potential to stay in the company and always keep progressing professionally to new challenges/positions. However... ConAgra sold their Private Brands business to TreeHouse and placed their career progression on a freeze. With this change in operating companies, TreeHouse also placed a freeze on progression as they tried to work through doubling their business size in one acquisition. It is an always-changing environment that did not allow for growth."
bad,"This job was ok. I liked it but they didn't pay enough. The work they do, people need to be paid more. The environment is dirty because you are dealing with nuts and packing. All kinds of bugs are in there."
bad,"Once you get the job down right, you would be able to the job right without stress. The workers are helpful ti new employees. Just didnt like the 10 points system. But other then that its an ok place to work. Some of the long term employers are some what helpful give good pointers on how to make your job easier."
good,Learned what I could in the time given. Besides the manager it was food. Not much home time though. No time for family. At all. Didn't like that. Its was hard to di
good,It took them two month for me learn my job as a mixer when I was in the North side I didn't do No mixing just opening boxes and cleaning machines and under the ovens I did that for my first month thier it when I got the South side I learn how to pre scale and mix and I like one or two mistakes but I was just learn how to do it and the day after I sign my hired papers they me go cuz I forgot one perscale I feel I was treated unfair and I would like another chance
good,The management has no idea what they are doing nor do they care about your personal life. The supervisors only promote you if you're their friend.
good,Small plant within a parent company. Some good points some bad. Expect to be supervised by people with marginal ability and education.................................
good,"12hr shifts. 4 shifts. Work a 2-2-3 schedule.  Paid breaks. After 1 year you get 2 weeks vacation. If you leave or laid off before your anniversary date, you get nothing. Good ol boy network. Move up if your connected somehow."
good,Treehouse can be a great company to work for but with the unknown fate of the company and decrease in employees as well as hours it has become a very drab working environment.
good,"I was only a temp which limited what i could actually do, Didn't get to do everything but i experienced what it was about and i can see why so many have came and went"
good,"After the acquisition, there was a sales re-org which changed my job within the org. structure.  This was a newly created role.  This role was then eliminated in April 2018"
good,once they merged the business really fell apart. lots of out of stocks and production issues. A revolving door of new employees and old ones leaving to find something better.
good,The transition of the ConAgra Private Brands to TreeHouse has proven to be a challenge. It seems as if management has had a hard time rolling systems and programs to allow success at the plant level.
good,"Decent place to get a start in the maintenance field, learned alot in my time there, its definitely a old boy system of management, your either in or out. Pay was ok, lots of  interpersonal drama among production though"
good,"The team I work with are hard working, great people.  However, management is non-communicative and culture is not employee focused.  Employees feel that they aren't supported or valued."
good,TreeHouse has great people working for them. The company is working on continued integration with the newly purchased portions of the company. Communication is still something that can be improved upon.
good,"the environment with the co-workers is fine, but the management need at lot of improvement. I think the first source of improvement is the supervisor. i have worked long time like a supervisor but when I saw as some supervisor did. I am very sorry."
good,Easy keeps you busy these not much to tell not a good place to work Mostly get help when asked It was alright Idk what else to say it was fun while it lasted
good,fiendly atmosphere room for improvement only down fall its hot poor equipment and day to day sheduling but coworker are great
good,Bad sales dept.Lost most of there acounts.Laid off  3\4 of the work force. Plus side its close to home.The pay is ok.The maintenace team are great guys.We have our fingers crossed that things will get better.
good,There was lots of growth and changes due to the rapid growth in size of the company.  They seem to be working their way through that but unfortunately cost several good people jobs as they reduced corporate offices.
good,"Pay is good but not enough for the expectations laid out.  Minimal training, and very difficult to get formal training approved."
good,"I had no choice about working at Treehouse Foods. They bought the company I worked at and so I was absorbed VS. joining on my own."
good,If you enjoy working hard and long hours this is a great job. I was employed by a temp company and learned to do several things while at this job. I would recommend it.
good,"was advertised as letting the people who know their business left alone to operate the business, but is turning into centralized top heavy company. too many bosses with too many projects not enough focus on business"
good,"Working 8-12hours a day (something it was mandatory)."
good,Treehouse is still growing and with any company that size they have their growing pains.  They will eventually settle into a nice niche in their industry and be a solid company in the future.
good,"Very difficult place to work, expectations and discipline on supervisors was extremely high, while on the hourly employees very little discipline was issued.  No work life balance due to weird shift."
good,"they will help you learn and grow but fail to inform you of your ahort comings or that you arent meeting expectations and when they do if you ask for specifcs they cant seem to give you any specifics only vagueness."
good,"Good company to work for, lots of opportunity to learn but not sure of the upward growth, work environment is flexible and your work culture is relaxed."
good,They never give enough hours to make a decent paycheck.  Every week they cut the hours and you cant make a good living and support my family. Need to give more hours.
good,"This company pays really well but, the problem with this company is you work 12 hour shifts and your schedule is not always the same so one day you might work 1st shift and then the very next day they need you to work second or third.  You were always given 8 hours off but, that is barely enough time to sleep!"
good,The culture of the company was getting out of hand. People were not valued because of the buddy system. The buddy system was a killer for morale. Advancement was null and void if you did not belong to the click.
good,"Was getting the hours every week sometime 7 days a week for months money was good when lasted"
good,Was a good place to work prior to being sold a couple of times.  New leadership does not understand the business and has made a couple of decisions that ultimately lead to the closing of the Battle Creek facility.
good,If you live out in the country it's a great paying job for just a high school diploma. Starting pay being around  $16 an hour and in 4 years you top out at $20 an hour. Great health benefits at a great price.
good,Very busy and comptetive. Made night go by fast. Every night was different didn't know where I was going. The assembly lines would night's go by fast.
good,Its fun easy job loved job they just lost alot of costumers do to shipping an traveling distance but doing the job isn't stressful have plenty vacation time if need time
good,It was a aight opportunity but they had a management switch and it messed up the chemistry great benefits also and great pay just bad management all in all it was good
good,"Bonus every 3 month , get 25 dollar to ur check with perfect attendance, free cake nd free bread once a while good meeting before we start work"
good,On work day consist of making sure the production line are ready to run by directing maintenance techs to assigned work area. Expediting repairs to minimize downtime.
good,Great experience for a small company. The company is private own and isn't family oriented. The company has 4 different shifts all working 12 hour shifts. The main point to complete your job successfully is staying on task to complete your job in a timely manner.
good,"good people, definitely was a fast-pace place to work, so I was moving around a lot. Definitely had a great supervisor that worked very hard to keep us going and having fun at the same time."
good,"busy day typically at work"
good,I was part of a buyout and from the beginning what was stated as cultural philosophy did not match with how business was conducted.  Many actions effected customer service and we were constantly putting out fires that were started from poor executive decisions.
good,I did SAP implementations at their manufacturing facilities I did a lot of traveling and gained a wealth of experience in SAP and food manufacturing. Overall I enjoyed my time at Treehouse Foods
good,Corporate is restricting headcounts and dissolving positions while simultaneously demanding increased production/results and more cost savings. It seems like the vast majority of decisions are made at the HQ level by people who have never worked at the plant level.
good,"TreeHouse acquired ConAgra's Private Brand team in early 2016.  TreeHouse treats the former ConAgra  employees as if they bring no value.  One by one, the ConAgra alum are leaving.  No communication in the organization.  Always in fear of losing jobs."
good,"a typical day at work is hot because u got to work in the oven ,cleaning the oven department . i learn how to clean alot wit different kind of chemical . The management is good they are nice always having a smile on there face. the workplace culture is alrite . the hardest part of the job is working in the heat. the most enjoyable part of the job is goin to work on a easy day not to much work to do and go home on time"
good,"I was a processor 2 which was responsible for preparing all of the ingredients for the batches to be mixed the next day. It was a lot of heavy lifting (I am a female but my two coworkers were females too and they did the job just fine.) Lifting 50 pound bags and boxes repeatedly. The warehouse is very unorganized and they don't have all of the tools required to make job as easy as possible."
good,Exciting place to work and get hands on experience.Many opportunities to learn and grow from. Fun and supportive co-workers to work with. There is always a new skill to learn and your input is always welcome. Everyone works together as a team.
good,"I love my job there as a packer, packer attendant, i love the fast pace workplace it keeps me busy all day.  A typical day at work for me would be working in a slow operating line I’m pretty past with my hands so I like a fast pace line."
good,"Its a decent job, but dont expect much care or concern from upper management. Middle management does try to make a change for the better, but after so much fo they and the workers concerns being ignored, they too tend to give up and just become sounding boards to complain at. "
good,Its a good place to work its a company that works hard and long hours you will be away from your family but it pays good  people there will help you on things
good,"I really loved my job but lost it because the company moved all jobs to Green Bay, WI.  The office was very relaxed and fun.  Wonderful people to work with."
good,It was a decent job with good pay. Work varied depending on the product we were doing and mangers walked around the factory all day inspecting the machinery and their employees.
good,The typical day at work is productive and organized. The workplace is clean and safe. There are rules and equipment to protect you while you work. You work as a team and everyone has a part.
good,This place is very family oriented. A lot of the employees were literally family and friends. The work got done with room for advancement. There are lots of people with good ideas and they are always heard and utilized
good,Good pay and benefits but management has went down hill fast... They are like most factories and only care about bottom dollar and not how they treat their employees.
good,"Company has undergone major changes after the treehouse acquisition. Can’t really offer a opinion on the recent going’s. As I worked for them, the company still offers the opportunity to advance positions if they realized the employee would be a good fit. The rotating 12 hour shifts were a little difficult and the weekly paychecks were amazing."
good,High turn over rate causes a lack of experiance. Managment doesnt have good communication across the board. It seems like each shift has its own set of rules.
good,"I worked in the freezer as a forklift operator, the position was fast paced most times with a relaxed atmosphere. The managers I had were good people and the team was decent as well."
good,"I enjoyed my time spent at Treehouse Foods at Forest Park, Georgia. The Plant Manager was one of the best to work for. I would have liked to taken the Plant Manager to Kumho Tire."
good,"Good company, good culture, good benefits. I have enjoyed working at TreeHouse Foods and would recommend it as a place of employment.  They seem to be growing in the right direction."
good,Good people and good company.  Recent restructure has cut back resources and capital money.  Cut cost is always hindering progress.  Good people in quality group. There seems to be a separation of quality and production goal.
good,I would often times find myself doing work on the same machine time and time again because management would want to take a perfectly good machine and modify it
good,I learned a lot with this company. They gave me a lot of feedback and help me grow as an individual in my career. They make the effort for the employee
good,"This is a really good company with an enjoyable culture. I really enjoy working here but they have one extremely glaring problem with upper management that makes it too difficult to perform my job properly. Outside of that one person this would be a dream job,"
good,I found the tree house was ok place the people who work there are far and nice with great spirits. But the packing area was fast  Pace  and  farely easy and the  palletizing area was cool and  calm slow pace but heavy lifting
good,I like working at Tree-house  Food it is a productive and  that does require working a lot of  hours to work but its easy to grow into higher or different career
good,"some positions are tougher then others, 40 hrs weekly plus OT usually given the nice thing is people could sign up to work your shift on Overtime days, which other jobs i’ve had don’t seem to do that! Job bidding is cool, you must stay in position six months before you can bid determine by how long you been there so there’s opportunities to move shifts/positions "
good,"Great place to work great pay,good people to work with.sometimes the hours and with out an off day could reach 15 days straight before getting a day off"
good,The workplace can sometimes fast- paced and a hot environment due to the roasters used to cook the product. And at the same time in the winter the complete opposite is true.
good,"Good benefits, vacation, 401k, insurance.  Make cookies which make people, children happy.  Limited growth opportunities.  High turnover. Long term employees are great."
good,"Work life balance is rough. Mostly because I am graveyard. Advancement is hard at treehouse! The people I work with are awesome! The pay is fair! Overtime is very helpful. The cons no sick days, the point system is not a fair system, other than that I like my job very much!"
good,It was a decent job up until I was told unexpectedly they were shutting down. Some of the Co workers an leads did a little to much slacking and flirting.
good,"Manufacturing facility with 3 shifts, M-F, and required weekend depending on production needs. Many opportunities within production, warehouse, QA, and distribution."
good,I have no desire to complete this section and feel that indeed needs to not make this a required field.  To force someone to complete this section when they have no desire to is not wise.
good,"Days are filled with clerical job duties as well as keeping up with quality of the product, putting holds on what is not up to par.  I learned to do environmental swabbing to make sure there is nothing in the machines that can be mixed in with the product that can cause illnesses. Management is sometimes okay but sometimes can be rude. The hardest part of the job is being forced to do overtime when I have a toddler at home and I'm a single parent so it just makes it difficult.  In my job there use to be some perks that came along with it and use to be enjoyable but that's all been pretty much taken away."
good,"Loaded and unloaded trucks, stocked food in designated areas  , took inventory quarterly, performed safety inspection on forklift before start of shift, kept area clean delivered materials to departments in a timely fashion..."
good,The workday was usually fun and others assisted when needed.  The culture was even paced and usually low stress.  The hardest part of the job was the time or times that I could not correct a customer's issue and I had to refer to management.  I enjoyed all of the people and the work from home days that the company provided.
good,"Clock in, pass downs, safety topics, coordinate with supervirsors for drills, product changeovers and machinery breakdowns. Learned to be articulate in a sense of respect, coordination and safety. Workplace culture is awesome for meeting others as well as earning and learning a new respect for your positions role."
good,A nice place to work . Great workforce . The only problem is upper management lack of consistency and adequate communication. Compensation and benefits are good.
good,loved working there great work place. They treat you like family. Everyone is always willing to help the next person if they need help. Some Jobs take a little more time
good,"as a Line tech I do mostly nothing most of the time and get paid well to do it. When things break or problems arise it gets stressful, hot, angry, busy and not fun fast. Co workers get board and start drama, the company often takes short cuts I.E. patch an issue instead of fixing it right the first time all in the name of production."
good,Good commute. Friendly staff. Easy to advance. Good benefits. I enjoyed the schedule I worked. I left because family life changed and i needed different hours which they did interview me for a position but at the time it was somewhat late.
good,"Great place to work with great co-workers. We have been sold and re-bought several times in the past 5 years."
good,Co-workers are great and management TRIES. Communication could be better. Emphasis on work / family life balance. That alone makes it one of the better companies to work for...
good,In my position you begin your day going to the lines running oatmeal and grab samples. You take them back the the lab and spend an hour to an hour and a half running samples and recording them in excel or other programs. You then do other tasks that they assign to you such as recording cleaning logs from the other employees on the lines. You then do a second check when you get done with that. You test oats that come in on railcars to make sure they are acceptable. During grabbing your samples you examine all the packaging to make sure it is sufficient for our standards. If there are any problems you stop what you are doing and make a hold. As for co-workers they are all nice to me. They have conversations with me and help me out if I have questions. There is only 1 lab tech working at a time which makes most of the work independent. The hardest part of the job is remembering where all the files are on the computer that you need. My most enjoyable part of the job is how laid back it is. I am never rushed and get to work at my own pace.
good,I was a temporary worker here and for the month and a half that i worked there i really enjoyed the people and the experience that i got . In total an amazing place to work
good,"Great work and home balance. They are changing their 12 hr working schedule, to 8 hr, 5 days a week from 7am to 3pm for first shift. 2nd shift will be from 3pm to 11pm and 3rd shift will be from 11pm to 7am."
good,"The hardest part of the job was taking the machine down & putting it back together, The Work Place was very clean, There was lots of leadership & help"
good,Managers on certain shifts DO play favorites. Not a horrible place to work and very good pay. Just don’t get on anyone’s bad side or they will fire you.
good,"Great job, great pay. Coworkers are nice. The schedule is kinda up in the air. They don’t commit to days off. It’s kinda up to our customers. If you have orders you work. If you don’t have orders you don’t work. It’s either feast or famine. Other than that though. You can move up really fast. And some of the positions pay really good."
good,"Every day is different, with challenges that can make for a rewarding career. People are kind and professional. Flexible hours for work-life balance. Secure employment."
good,"Treehouse was a very enjoyable company to work for. The leadership believed in the mission and was willing to bring it down to the line worker to assure they understood. That type of leadership mad an impression on me, I was sad when they sold my portion of the business to Riverbend Foods."
good,The company has many good resources and talent to help individuals develop and grow in different areas of interest.  A very strong commitment to safety and continuous improvement.  Willing to invest in individuals with training.
good,Meeting and collaborating with internal team members in order to drive efficiencies and synergies for the better of the organization.
good,Good management .Pay was excellent for the work we had to perform.Room to grow in the company.Coworkers were helpful when some one needed assistance with a job you had to do.
good,i learned a good bit. I learned how to operate a forklift a lot of the people that work there are nice some are not you get paid 20 min breaks its not to stressful either even though its fast paced
good,"Great work life balance and management style "
good,"Fast paced environment, constantly changing priorities, many opportunities to increase skill set and to grow as employee. Multi layered organization with many opportunities."
good,"Fast paced workplace, learned more skills that enable me to think quickly on my feet! Co workers were very helpful, worked together as a team.  Management was very receptive to my feedback."
good,For the most part it's a fair place to work the only bad part is the heat in the summer time. People are easy to get along with and the jobs aren't too intensive.
good,"Job was relaxed.  You have your own set of customers, but you help your team when needed.  Great place to work, but due to job elimination and building closure, I was forced to move on."
good,This company salary was great for the area and Bonuses are given based on profits.  Advancement possibilities. Flexible shifts and paid lunch hours.  Free lunches for job well done
good,a company that has allowed me to grow by giving me the opportunity to work in other areas.  The company believes in hiring the right people to do the job and have the right fit with the company's vision.
good,Treehouse has a great family/work life balance. They also value collaboration and new ideas when a new task is needed. Actually looked forward to going into the office everyday.
good,"Treehouse is a great place to work for. Management is great. Benefits are great. The flexibility is great. It really helps to work for educated people who actually care for their employees and understand that we have a home life besides work. Thank you."
good,"The company and workers are great and the company always tries to make changes to improve every year, however employee appreciation could be better.  Incentive to do better and improve moral."
good,Exceptionally focused and seasoned Sanitation Worker with a superb eye for detail and customer service record. Adept multitasker able to handle a high volume of simultaneous sanitation tasks quickly accurately and safely. Skilled in working independently with little to no direction or as part of a professional food processing facility sanitation team. Manages to be on time and on task.
good,"Since I worked by myself at the warehouse, I didn't have much stress. It was a very fun work place and made it easy to work since I worked by myself with no troubles."
good,They have been in omaha a little over a year.  Most of the people that work there were laid off by conagra and so when treehouse bought some of the plants they hired some of the employee.  The employees that were still at conagra are getting laid off now.
good,"Confidential                                                                       a typical day at work"
good,Interview and hire new team members.   Perform both classroom and field training.  On call to complete sales transactions for new team members.   Responsible for service of equipment.
good,Treehouse Foods was a good job just management wasnt the best. I enjoyed my job most of the time due to the environment that I was in great co workers. The only thing that wasn't the best was the amount of task we had to accomplish within our shifts.
good,Great people to work with... I do over night..  it's chill.. more relaxed over night... No one standing over top of you while u working ya know??  It's kool laid back I guess... All u basically doing is watch a machine all nite and make sure it's stocked up with box's or not jammed up....  Or u stack'n box's all night
good,"good paying job, sometimes can get stressful , but otherwise great place . You can make great money if you want to work hard and work your life away ."
good,this is a great place to work and the people that I work with are even better the only reason that I am leaving is that my husband was transferred and now I need to move with him... :(
good,"Working at tree house was good, its a very fast pacing job.Getting to learn new nuts, and learning and packing new trail mixes. learning how certain foods are made"

good,if i didnt move states away i would still be working for them loved it there. Management listens to ideas you have to improve. stress free environment.decent break times.
good,It was a good place to work great coworkers. And the pay and hours were good too. Alot of repetion but if your a hard worker you advance within the company.

good,TreeHouse is a nice place to work. The main office is very nice and the lab space is also very nice and comfortable. Everyone is polite and keeps to themselves.
good,"Great place to work. Stresses that a balance between home and work life is important. Management listens to concerns and those doors are always open. Friendly people, clear job duties, ability to work on your own, not micro-managed."

There are quarterly bonuse if earned, everyone willing and ready to help, co-workers are willing to help and keep it fun. Supervisors are awesome. People and pay are competitive. Benefits and hours are a treat with overtime is easy to come by, time and a half. Over all it's an interesting, relaxed, fast paced job to have although some jobs there are gravy jobs but there are is no job too hard. Family oriented and have dinners and parties for special occasions. They give out free samples which is nice. They try to gather everyone's opinion on how things could be better. VERY SAFETY ORIENTED. Safety glasses, uniform t-shirts and jeans, steel toe boots, hair nets and beard nets are required. Pay is excellent. Good luck."
good,"A typical day at work was taking over from the prior shift, I learned how to use the hydraulic controls to my food bins, Management was just great, open door policy was great. The people there were so friendly made me fill right at home almost instantly. Her hardest part of my job was trying to keep up demand of product due to I had no one to cover me when I went to lunch or breaks. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I kept up with my line, it was very challenging on a daily bases."

good,"very cool place to learn production process."
good,Setting up and programming machines. I learned how to run each machine properly and efficiently. The workplace had a good working environment. The hardest part of the job was to make sure everyone was doing there job right we had a lot of new temps come in and out every night and it made it hard for me as a machine operator to teach and train them on what to pack and how to pack and what to look for when they are packing the product. What I enjoyed most about my job was that it kept me busy and challenged me to be better and it pushed me to gain more knowledge.
