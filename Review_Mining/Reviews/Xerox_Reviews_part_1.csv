rating,review
bad,Get yelled at for nothing all the time. Inconsistent directions.  Loud place with no windows.. Supervisors have power complexes but are not held accountable for what they say. Eg. I had a migrane headache and asked my supervisor if I could lie down in a quiet dark place for a while. He said yes. I found an unoccupied office and lay on the floor with the lights off for a while (less than 30 mins). When I went back to work I got a written reprimand for leaving my station. The manager said I should have known better even if my supervisor said it was ok.
bad,Terrible place to work .. Great co workers bad management. Good overtime opportunities. Gained a lot of good customer service skills. Great start for a job
bad,"This is not a company to try to work your way up the ladder. Bug infestations are not taken seriously. The management is hostile towards everyone they don't favor. The work environment is immature at best and hostile at its worst. Pay is low, benefits are barely there, the training is monotonous and does not reflect the work."
bad,"Productive and workplace not good "
bad,"The managers are not trained to lead or manage, it's about who you know and are friends with the managers and directors gossip more than the employees and they dont care about the workers, you are only a number. Nothing is fair training is poor and there has been no pay increase for over 12 years after many promises of an increase. Also the facility is dirty and mold is dropping from the ceiling."
bad,"Weinig positiefs te melden, helaas over deze werkgever. Slechte afspraken, hoge werkdruk, te weinig salaris. Echter wel leuke collega's"
bad,"This job sucks. I would not wish this job on my worst enemy."
bad,They work you like a slave and management is terrible. They only understand what they want to understand. I'm glad I no longer work at this organization
bad,"8-430 stress full day and lots of spying"
bad,our company was rebadged through Xerox during a time when it was not yet fully structured for BPO processes.  Support was difficult.  It was invigorating to be on the ground floor of structuring it all out for our project.
bad,"this company is managed by co-dependant, narcissistic, perfectionist.  they create tasks that are not job related, and they they try to impose military type justice where all reps suffer from the lack of performance and the minority."
bad,Yes you do get to work from home. But it’s not what it’s cracked up to be. If something goes wrong with the system. It’s your fault and you have to go without pay. Honestly they should of kept everybody in the Bolingbrook location.
bad,"Don’t recommend "
bad,"Well  the ABC pay scale didn't work out for them hence the lawsuit. Poor working conditions, as long as applicants  had a pulse they were  hired. 10 minute  breaks , doubt they followed  labor laws."
bad,Mostly ghetto trash works there.  Got fired because broke my toe on metro and manager wrote me every time went to emergency room and doctor appointments even though had note stating where i was she refused to accept it.  I should have refused to sign and asked her to sign a letter stating she refused my medical excuses. I have never worked for a company this deceitful in my whole 30 + years working.  This is not even remotely diverse the Houston location is 98% black.  I wanted to get into training but they hired people in that role that was far below my educational experience only for those roles.  They punished people with degrees.
bad,but the company is lairs and they go back and forth with the customers about credits and fees its bad i will never with for the sprint part again 5 am shift the customers are crazy and yell at you
bad,"Management was completely unprofessional.  The pay was not comparable to other companies.  One of the worst experience I’ve encountered.  I would definitely not recommend this company (location- London, KY) to anyone."
bad,"This company does not care about anything but numbers, and if you work here, you are just a number. If your lucky, your desk will be close to the bathroom b/c in my experience, if your unlucky your desk is 5-7 minutes away. This sucks when you have a 15 minute break and you are threatened with being fired if you have to do to the bathroom before/after your break. If your also lucky, your manager will actually be in your section managing instead of running off to another section to talk to their manager friend, who also isnt doing their job. Try finding a CSR job for a small business and you will be better off all around"
bad,"The company who INVENTED the “mouse”, the “Icon” and “video conferencing” concepts NO LONGER EXIST."
bad,"Low job culture, bad life-job balance, poor compensation and benefit package, extremely stressful, constant overtime and on-call practice."
bad,I do not wish to provide a review of this company as it would not be a very positive one. It is a very large corporation. I think everyone needs to form their own opinion of this company depending on their circumstances.
bad,Not recommended for employment. They are not flexible and only have evening work. Don't waste time. The Naperville office closed suddenly without notice
bad,Not at all what they tell you it will be. Terrible management and no room to advance.  Zero support from supervisors on your shift. Allowed to be verbally abused by customers
bad,The place was ghetto. Management was made up of people who couldn’t  supervise cattle. I quit due to lack of respect and professionalism. I was an outstanding employee who was admired by many
bad,Only work here if you are desparate enough to feel like you are in a max security prison while at work.  DON'T DO IT UNLESS YOUR LIFE ABSOLUTELY DEPENDS ON A PAYCHECK COMING SOON.  YOU CAN AND WILL FIND BETTER.  I believe in you.
bad,This company cares nothing for it's employees. It is by far the worst place I have ever worked. LIfe trapped me there. I am so glad that I no longer work for that company and will NEVER again work for such a souless company.
bad,This job was terrible none of my other jobs event compare. Shared headsets with hundreds of other employees. Then they ask when people get sick constantly.
bad,"Harbored a very hostile environment. It was ok for trainers to play inappropriate adult games while the managers where not on the floor. It was also ok for the supervisors to call new agents were referred to as female dogs in heat when agents would ask about their stats. Also they lied on their job posting, when people applied for the position it was because the posting advertised Technical Support positions but when we showed up on the first day of training, we were told it was customer service."
bad,"Prepaid phone account management, the meanest worst people call you to tell you you messed up their phone, and you are personally responsible for fixing it now, ok, need manager overrides on most calls, managers like to dance around everywhere else but where you need them, while a customer yells at you to get their phone working, and it's out of you power, oh wait? bad review because you didn't make their phone start working for free? too darn bad, it your fault and counts against you."
bad,I have work here for 7 years and the money went down but the insurance went up they don't care about they employes the work hours are to long for some one who has kids and a family
bad,very unprofessional no room for advancement poor working conditions I would not recommend. don’t care about your life outside of there at all. A mess !
bad,Hated  XEROX. They have poor management whose hugs and sell and smoke dope. The dressed like they we’re going g to the farm with rags on their head. The nicked picked about sprinkling when you tickle actually had a whole two meetings? They so petty and messy
bad,"The most unfair employer I have had the change to work with. No benefits were provided while working there (i.e: healthcare, 401(k), etc.). Exploited employees with little overtime pay."
bad,By far this was the Worst job ever messy management lazy management . Never wanted to help . Messy messy messy !gossip all the time! Never wanted to take sup calls
bad,"Now this place makes money but not the employees . Bad management, working conditions and no increase in pay. Good benefits but expensive!!  You have to kiss tail to get somewhere and that's that me!! I dont care how hard you work or even how good at your role you are...if you bit kissing tail you not moving up. So many broken promises and and threatening emails from management its sad!!  I will step foot in that horrible place ever!!"
bad,"Typical day includes logging into phone to help irritated members for eight hours a day, five days a week. no weekends off. no paid time off. low hourly pay."
bad,"Scary bedbugs"
bad,I did not enjoy working there and would not recommend it. They work environment is stressful and fast paced. The job is hard as well as the environment is unpleasant to work in.
bad,"Xerox is a joke, full of empty promises from management and a useless HR. If you like harrasment and being underpaid for the amount of work given to you Xerox is the job for you. When you work for Xerox you are called a Xeroid, because you are a robot with no emotions and no need to support yourself so pay doesn't matter. Do yourself a favor take your knowledge and go elsewhere, I have met tons of ex Xerox employees at Ricoh"
bad,"Se pone mucho foco en satisfacer a los cliente, practicando previamente con el nivel de satisfacción de lo empleados."
bad,"This is a very unprofessional place to work. I would never recommend it to anyone at all. This company has no structure what so ever and management is all over the place, very unorganized."
bad,"The management runs on school type bossing, company is going down due to clash with Fuji hence they are never going to hire contract employees on there payroll, the managers misbehave and harass there employees pressurize to leave once hired. Employees can do nothing as most of them are working on contract bases"
bad,"I was contracted with Xerox for Docucare role. The management treats contract employees very rude.They hire and fire contract employees no matter how good job you do. They make you to do everyrhing for them as a contract employee, still they don't appreciate your hard work. Horrible company to work for and I wish I would knew before I accepted the contract."
bad,"This is by far the worst company I ever worked for in my life, the place was filthy, degrading , it was like a major high school and club mixed together the only way to advance was to either sleep with management or be best friends that was it!!!"
bad,I worked here for about six months before I realized that I needed to go back to school if I wanted to have a better life. You were supposed to get paid based on how much work you did but management seemed to give you the lowest amount of pay as possible. It did not matter if I worked 53 hours or 40 hrs per week I always made the same amount of money.
bad,"Supervisors were competing to such a degree as to be destructive to the business for, work space spines and equipment creating anxiety and constant interpersonal conflict, leading to personal confrontations, and destruction of company equipment leading by group targeting of unliked individuals who are trying to improve or gain promotion, to loss of productivity and earnings. Competition with other call centers which escalated to the lowest tactics of cheating and phony professionalism directed at people working to carry the entire company, I worked for seven years and was forced by management to keep my job to, tolerate hate filled raciest and homophobic speech and threats of violence from america's Waring LOW and UPPER Classes. Supervisors dodged work constantly, due to unreasonable stress,for which they would selthfully cover with enthusiasm and a passion and redirect outwardly with random socialized sadism, If you regard your life experience and health DON'T work for Xerox."
bad,I'm not sure it matters because they're not in town anymore ....But they were bar none THE worse to call center ever...Management was in disarray and they always messed up your pay checks .
bad,The place is just unorganized and they honestly feel kkke how have no life out the life you are already trying to balance... they find anything to write you up about which is not fair and management takes side with the supervisor and etc.
bad,"Do not work here ever! Even if you're homeless!  They don't care about their employees or their customers.  The company motto is ""just get meat in the seats! "" meaning hire anybody and ""fake it till you make it"" which means lie to the customers, coworkers and management!"
bad,"You’ll get free pizza after each month end but if you have any problems while working here good luck getting help because the HR dept is a joke"
bad,Worst place to work. Everyone that I know used to work there either left or been laid off. Management does not know what they doing. Upper management arrogant and no manners to talk to lower level individual or even customer.
bad,"Working with Xerox was not only the worst job I've had but the worst experience I've had. "
bad,"Horrible place to work. Managers are clueless, the wage is low and you are expected to do atleast 3 peoples work. Even the Team Leaders palm their duties off onto you onto of all the other work you have. Can forget about bonuses as if one person on your team doesnt perform then the whole team doesnt get their bonus which happens every month due to the fact that Xerox hire anyone. So many people with no knowledge of IT or even common sense. Was only there for 3 months and I. That space of time seen atleast 9 colleagues leave and new staff join who also left. The are really bad at candidate retention. Will let some of their brilliant minds go rather than offer them a pay increase and will make due with lower quality work instead where several complaints and fines are imposed on the company. Have even seen them lose 2 big government contracts due to rubbish work ethic and poor management."
bad,"While coworkers are great, the company itself is poorly run and they do not care about their employees. Raises are little to nothing and there are no perks."
bad,Wasn’t the best place to work. High turn over. But I stayed to support my little family. There was never much team work. Different departments never wanted to take ownership of their positions.
bad,Los empleados estaban bajo constante estres ya que se le exijia a los empleados hacer tareas extracurriculares que no tenian nada que ver con su area de trabajo
bad,"this company had no type of professionalism with management and coworkers. Did not give detailed instructions and made you do multiple aspects of the job without sufficient pay. Managers were unprofessional, gossiping and starting outside drama in the workplace"
bad,I don't believe that companies should make employees ask customers that are calling in to troubleshoot there internet/cable/ phones to also try and sell the customer more items
bad,If you enjoy being talked down to or belittled by customers while at work then this would be your place. I was never given positive feedback and I didn't get paid a lot to make this worth my while.
bad,Pesima area laboral. Pago minimo. Gerentes y TMs no muy profesionales.
bad,"It's high stress, barely above minimum wage, and no one there cares about employees. If you miss a day off training you'll probably be fired."
bad,"I hated working here. So unprofessional, management was not organizes at all. There would be fights in and outside the building. Co-workers stealing lunches. It was the worse."
bad,they turn a blind eye to harassment while making you fear constantly that your job is at risk.  very poor availability to help your customer and very statistic oriented not customer oriented
bad,"If you've ever worked for a call-center, you know they all have a few metrics from which an employees performance is rated. Xerox had metrics like Average Handle Time (AHT), Customer satisfaction ratings from surveys, maximum transfer percentages, first-call resolution, and the like. Nothing unusual so far. Except an employee there could ignore ALL other metrics as long as they achieve the AHT goal: which was 5 minutes for a DSL Internet Tech Support job. 5 minutes is achievable if your customer is knowledgeable about internet modems, routers, network settings, etc, but those people never call Tech Support. So for the rest, 5 minutes is only achievable if you find clever ways to get your customer to either hang up or agree to be transferred elsewhere. In most call centers, your performance is rated monthly. At Xerox, it's rated per call. If you're over 5 minutes on ANY call on ANY day, supervisors would breathe down your neck about it. Also if you're still interested in this job and want to seek a promotion, you should develop a smoking habit. Xerox tends to only promote their smoking buddies in back-room deals, and then announce applications are available for promotions afterwards, so they could falsely claim they made the opportunity available to everyone."
bad,Xerox was the worst place I have ever worked.  As a matter of fact the entire company wound up completely closing down shortly after I left.  They would force you to skip lunch even if they bought lunch because of the over kill on calls.
bad,"When I worked there, it was no structure. The managers where making the same thing we were making, so they didn't care. They promised use raises after 6 weeks, and it never came."
bad,Brought in management from the outside. They do not care about employees. Management loots the company for their own benefit. Layoffs is all they got!
bad,"They had massive layoffs without any justification. company culture was terrible . management didnt care much about the staff, it was all about the bottom line"
bad,All employees were treated like they were disposable. Supervisors weren't paid any better and everyone was just treated poorly all around. My whole team was terminated with no waring and Xerox fought us when we pursued unemployment.
bad,The supervisor  is a fat pig that doesn’t do nun all day but be on her phone and eat the manger is a stiff weave immature woman that onlys does her job when the big folks come to visit
bad,"You will never work 40 hours. They VTO every day"
bad,Working here was a nightmare. The work hours were terrible and the staff was never never available when you needed them. It seem that you were pretty much on your own with everything.
bad,"Upper management seems disconnected from the rest of the company.  No to little chance of advancement, lack of vision from management, all with continual threats of layoff for a job well done. "
bad,when I was hired there were tons of employees and within three months everyone was fired because they couldn't afford to keep it open with that many people they became a micro site.
bad,"This was the most unprofessional environment that I have ever worked in.  The trainers were hitting on the new reps, the supervisors were incompetent and the reps came to work either high or drunk."
bad,"Management plays favorites and not all the rules apply to everyone. "
bad,While learning about the company was interesting all you did for the job was talk to one customer after the next in what felt like an endless amount of complaints.
bad,i got into a terrible car accident when i worked here and they were very unwilling to work with me with my recovery and when i said i was just going to quit they tried to keep me but they still wouldnt work with what i needed
bad,The job is hard enough on it's own but management won't life a finger to defend you from callers who are angry over any variety of issues that they either cannot remedy or don't want to
bad,I hated working for this company. I loved my manager but beyond that management was horrible. You were treated like scum. The pay is not worth the stress and no hope of ever promoting or getting pay raises. I was given a pay raise and then the next pay raise was to match the new hires so my hard work was for nothing. Management spent more time running around playing in dinosaur outfits than actually doing their jobs.
bad,"The only thing that I have to say about this deplorable company is that they treat their employees as if they are disposable garbage.  Which is never a good thing.  I had medical issues, and documentation to prove as such.  They still made sure to point me out as soon as they could.  A lady had a minor STROKE in the building while attempting to work.  The ambulance came in and took her out on a stretcher...they still pointed her for missing the rest of that day.  That is just unacceptable.  If someone was intentionally missing work, that would be an entirely different story.  However, intentionally missing work is not always the case."
bad,This company was transitioning from the Sprint acquisition. I was hired during this transition period which saw many changes as is typical during such times.
bad,I would never recommend anyone to work at Xerox. This job was so stressful and they made you do mandatory overtime even on your off days. They constantly changed my schedule and the supervisor and mangers was no help at all.
bad,I loved my job in some way but when i asked to be relocate after my soultion knowning there was other locations and they wouldnt relocate me thats when i left the job. I couldnt handle being around someone knowning that there family member was involved with my brothers murder. After working there for 10 years you would think that they would help that employee after putting in some many years when they didnt i couldnt work with a company that didnt care for there employees
bad,"Be patient with callers because by the time you get to they're call, they have already spoke with so many other reps, and they are already frustrated."
bad,"You start at a base pay (close to minimum wage). However, your pay is based on your (customer based) stats which is also determined by customers and depicts your overall performance. You can get 3 surveys a day, up to 10 a month (this info is based off of when I worked there 1 year and 7 months ago). If you failed 1 out of 10 surveys in that month, it takes passing 9 survey's with 100% customer rating to not lose pay. You're constantly sitting for long periods of time to answer phones, the IT department was awful to collaborate with, most of the time I did my best to resolve customer's tech related concerns, because it was quicker and more efficient. Lacey's Customer Service Center is ABSOLUTELY 100% the best because the Customer Service Agents actually care and work hard to resolve customers concerns. This position requires that you speak with Verizon Wireless Customers (which could be anyone) and you are not allowed to hangup, only a supervisor can (if you can get his/her attention). I hung up because my mental state was more important to me than the feelings of an abusive individual over the phone."
bad,never was satisfied with the business all over all. the hardest part was the stress. no type of advancement at all. drama seriously like high school enviorment.
bad,"They do not look after their staff well at all. The have too many chiefs and not enough Indians, managers have a chip on their shoulders. Seem to be obsessed with out sourcing and do not understand the Irish market."
bad,this would be a good job for a person who has no kids and this may be your first job other than that I would not work here they will hire people that have been fired before.
bad,If you become pregnant while you work there you will get screwed. Horrible place to work. The culture is not good there. It's a revolving door over there.
bad,Xerox was a great place to work when I first started with the company because GE had partnered with them and we adopted their culture. IT changed drastically after that.
bad,"This company has no value. Management is a complete joke. The most enjoyable part of the job is your paid break and unpaid lunch break. The hardest part, taking 75-130 calls daily."
bad,Dirty rotten slave drivers!!! 7 am to 3 am shifts on piece rate. Bu-bye!!! Even with an ADAA request there was no relief. Chained to my desk. Work from home dream job was my worst nightmare. Went from team of 12 to a team of 5 in 3 weeks.
bad,This company was formally called ACS.  It was horrible to work for. they had poor management and did not do much for their employees. This portion of the company is now out of business.
bad,I did not enjoy working at Xerox. Not many hours to choose from also you only got 3 breaks. two of them are 5 minutes so you can run to the restroom and a 30 minute lunch break
bad,"enjoyed working her temporarily, great start for college students or those without college degree and searching for a full time job and place of work."
bad,They treated some groups of employees better than others. Pay and employment advancements were given based on friendship instead of how well someone performed.
bad,You had to try to type as fast as you could while a customer was talking and try to think on what you could do to fix the problem and what sales pitch you should give. It was so stressful I passed out on the floor and then found out I was pregnant.
bad,Xerox is conduent still the same peoples running the office no matter what name they change too the same peoples in the call center that makes there own rules it  is a bad company to work for i am suprise that medicare has not pull there contract from them. They put 4 to 5 skill sets upon you to be perfect performance  under paid and put stress upon you. Dont go there
bad,"Does not matter if you work hard, you will still get laid off. No job security at all. Look else for employment."
bad,"promotions, overtime, and rewards were given based off of favoritism. They would punish you if you call into work. If you reported anything to HR you were retaliated against."
bad,The company is making cuts from the wrong places.  They should cut from above and not below.  good people losing their jobs..its sad that they kept employees that are not qualified
bad,"This place is like a prison, no cell phone, people looking over your shoulder. Always waiting for your phone to ring. Too many rules that are unnecessary."
bad,"Some groups are really nice. They work hard and produce good technology. Unfortunately, I was in the wrong group. Although I had given my heart and soul to the group, but In return, I lost all my self-esteem."
bad,"Not a pleasant environment to work in.  The leaders are not ones who set a good example of how a leader should work.  They are very unprofessional.  There are OM'S that are dating supervisors, a GM that is a pervert.  Promotes women who are young and willing to kiss up to him."
bad,I was a member of there call center. I was required to take calls for verzion callers.I would go over their accounts with them if they where able to get on. Help with the understanding or disagreement on their account via bills or payments. Help with user controls. I loved the part of helping others. However I did not enjoy how supervisors were not always on the same page. Always mixing up information or one will approve of something then another supervisor will say another.
bad,"Untrained, unprofessional, wicked from the higher ups all the way down. I was actually encouraged NOT to do my job correctly and reprimanded for doing it right and helping clients. They knowingly violate state laws, encourage employees to do so and if trouble comes, they fire employees and management gets away Scott free.  They terminate benefits without just cause, don't fix errors, have ridiculous quotas and time limits that make real customer service impossible and it's back to back calls.  Good luck getting help when you need to ask a question.  Promotions only are given through favoritism and they only like the worst people.  Trainer talks about people badly in the class and shames them and he was promoted.  The Devil owns this company and these people are pure evil. RUN!"
bad,I have nothing to say about this company as I worked for a contracted one under them that may or may not have anything to do with actual Xerox standards.
bad,"They don't know what they are doing. My manager doesn't even know the process for the company. I wasn't trained, I was given a computer to use that was not fully set up, and when I needed assistance no one would assist me. Overall they showed me poor job quality, a bad business model, and lack of desire to do the job."
bad,"This was the worst job ever. The pay was terrible and they have a system in place that reduced your pay based on survey scores. The management was terrible, to the extreme of having bar fights with employees. When I was employed there, we were often visited by the local police, either due to illegal drug activity, persons purchasing stolen property, prostitution, or firearms. One of the trainers was prosecuted for child pornography on his home and work computers."
bad,"We need a Human Resource on site so bad its becoming unreal, management is walking around here acting like they are Suge Knight, and these are women. They are intoxicated by power, they go off half cocked, and lets not forget the favoritism."
bad,people work habits were non existent managers took advantage of there role company polices were terrible and money was never right survey system was not good for reps messed check up for issues that might not have been caused by you
bad,This company was horrible to work for. I was hired on and then fired due to them getting rid of a department then called back 2 days later for them to start my training in another two weeks.
bad,"Very unsupportive, dictate versus proper management, and does not understand the challenges faced by most employees. HR is nonexistent and also provides very little support."
bad,There was no advancement or team work.  The job was very boring!  The only good thing about that job was that I was allowed to bring a book!  The only good thing about my supervisor was that she worked on the other side of the room.  I didn't even make the needed amount of  money to purchase something out of the vendi machine!
bad,Xerox is an exceptional  place to learn and thats it. It has very poor management and you can never get help when you need it. you are penalized for things that you have not yet learned or that has not been set in concrete...learn and go!!!
bad,"I was dissatisfied with the work environment. People were slowly being laid off as budget cuts came and fewer orders from clients came in. There wasn't enough time in the day to complete the design requests from customers, this caused the work to bottleneck. Some orders would not make it to our desks until weeks after being submitted. Also, the pay was terrible. I would have been better off as a waiter at apple-bees. I eventually decided to leave due to the stressful workplace and lack of adequate compensation for work."
bad,"I worked in multiple Departments for the company, they are an outsourcing company that handles different clientele, and even then there were so many issues and problems."
bad,"Handled the company’s broad line of office copiers, along with digital networked multi-functional devices for"
bad,"The most stressful employer and work environment I ever worked!"
bad,"Commissions based on sales. Commission rates were always complicated and confusing and subject to change on the whims of management. "
bad,"Mass Layoff in Xerox India Gurgaon on 30 and 31 Aug 2018. Almost 45-50 employees fired on the same day without any proper reason. On the name of restructuring ..lack of vision..poor management ultimately lowered employee suffered the most. All Big fish saved themself as usual who were responsible for poor planning, management and vision. Spoiled career of many knowledgeable employees."
bad,Pay is well below normal for the same position at other companies. They play favorites and promote based on friendship instead of based on merit. Disgraceful!
bad,trabajo inestable nada organizado y piden disponibilidad 100 % cuando los terminos son otros
bad,"30 yrs ago, Xerox was a great place to work. Today no one feels secure & the people left behind after the lay offs are overworked & under appreciated."
bad,Working there my blood pressure went through the roof. My stress level sky-rocketed andI had to go on meds. I began having anxiety attacks. That place is and was the worse management environment I have ever been subjected to and have ever seen. I've seen slave camps and sweet-shops run better than that place.
bad,"Was hired for remote work then forced to drive downtown 30 minutes each way.  Ok, got over it.  But, it quickly became apparent that those who had been tenured there had done so by throwing others in front of any bus passing by.  Watch your back there."
bad,I learned how a good company could be destroyed when it`s in the hands of not professional and egoist people. The manager treated everybody without any respect. Since I started 80% of the people in the department quite because of the bad attitude of the manager.
bad,this place is just like an other call center. I've learned working here about credit. the management was very poor ad the culture were mainly African Americans but had Hispanics as well. The hardest part was building rapoor with customers. I enjoy this job due to the people I have meet
bad,I will not recommend this company as a place to work. The managers are very picky with who they want on their team or who they are willing to help. They are not helpful at all. The pay is very low to deal with customers cussing you out from a different state. This job is unprofessional.
bad,This call center is the least paid call center I have ever worked for. For what is expected the money is not enough. I think that if  the pay rate is raised then the Turn over rate would be much less.
bad,"No room for advancement, the pay remains the same no matter how amny years you work there"
bad,"Ever since I started working, every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it. So that means that every single day that you see me, that’s on the worst day of my life."
bad,"The worst place ever.  Management only tells you when something is wrong, not when right.  Management yells vs talks to staff.  Favoritism is everywhere"
bad,Did not enjoy work for Xerox the work was great management was not knowledge of the work that needed to be completed.The worker was fine but  not  easy to work with
bad,The located that i worked at for xerox was an unprofessional setting. There was a lot of inappropriate things and relations that took place in the work place that i didn't view as professional. I wouldn't recommend working for xerox at the location located on Hayes road.
bad,"Don't work here if you can help it. There is no room at all for advancement, and if there is someone who brown noses will get it way before anyone else has the chance to."
bad,"Not a great place to work.  Senior management is not forthcoming, a lot of layoffs, they don't care about their employees and not transparent with clients."
bad,"Very toxic environment in a call center. Everyone is on edge from being yelled at, and they will work you to the bone.  I would not encourage anyone to work here"
bad,This is the worst company I have ever worked for.  They will do anything they can in order to pay their employees less money. They are exploiting their workforce and I wouldn't recommend anybody to work for this company
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone. I believe now it is called something else. But you will have no life and the schedule changes are crazy. If you dont do anything at all this would be a good fit.
bad,"I learned all about prescription drug plans.  Many beneficiaries wanted to know if their drugs would be covered.  Sometimes they weren't, and people would get frustrated.  You really had to do everything you could to help them."
bad,"Xerox is now Conduent. This organization is very inconsistent with stable structure. It's unknown what the changes are in place now that they have changed their name, but previous management and structure are very chaotic."
bad,"Everyone does whatever they have to do to survive on 9.50 to 12.50 an hour. Employees tend to be petty, but there were a few good people there. The reception position I had there was pleasant over all."
bad,There was daily stress from the environment (racial discrimination) and lack of coaching or advancement. I was treated unjustly as were many other employees. I would Not recommend for anyone to work for Xerox.
bad,"Xerox as it currently stands is focusing way too much on cost reduction and this is greatly affecting all of the once positive aspects the company once had."
bad,"This company needs to become a stable company before it can start treating employees with respect. "
bad,"I was not a fan of this place at all. My grandfather had died from cancer, and while I was out for bereavement they had expected me to call in stating that he was still dead EACH DAY. I had returned to work with a final warning for my attendance without having any other infractions whatsoever."
bad,"Very unorganized, poor management physical fights on floor and located in the hood of Houston they left the employees in limbo after hurricane Harvey forcing us to return right after the storm or be fired"
bad,"Management sucks big time, they are worse then the regular employees. They make you complete training a whole much and the day before you on the floor they tell you the pay rate changes depending on approvals and error rate. Management shows alot of favoritism and the only way you are moving up is if you kiss behind. I would never go back!"
bad,"A typical day at Xerox consisted of you being cursed out all day with little to no resolution for the customer. I learned that no matter how good of a worker you are, favoritism always wins at places of employment. Managment does not care for their workers, as though we do not have lives outside of work. The workplace culture was very sloppy. The hardest part of the job was meeting the unrealistic score cards for canceling customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was when it was time to go home!"
bad,"Run, run as fast as you can.  Do not believe anything they say in the interview process.  They leave out  great deal and paint the company up to something it will not live up to.  They lie.  It's based on production and it fixed so only a few people (only) will meet production.  This is fixed and no one else will be able to meet the average pay that is needed to survive.  I know of several people who tried to stay (employer's market) and ended up with their automobile being ""re-po"" and kicked out of their apartment.  This place is a horrible.  Do not work for this place unless have another income.  They will send you home when they run out of work - without pay.  They will feel no regret - the supervisor will say you should have planned better. Their systems are constantly going down and the job is based on production.  They will ask for you to turn in ""exception report"" - this too is a joke.  DO NOT FALL PREY TO THESE PREADATORS - THEY WILL EAT YOU ALIVE AND THEN PICK AT YOUR BONES."
bad,I would Not recommend to work for Xerox/Conduent as the management was Not good. The stress level literally put me into taking an FMLA for Months! The work load was ridiculous and un-attainable. I would certainly Not recommend anyone to work there!
bad,"This seemed to be a great company to work for until you get comfortable and locked in with dependency."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this place of employment to no one. They are unorganized. The supervisor has lack of training. The training is helpful to what they require on the actual floor.
bad,"This employer is awful! There is more security in this facility than in a government job. You walk through security to get on and off campus. You're not permitted to have your phones on the call floor, even in case of an emergency. Customers review you and can give you great reviews, however, if you spend more than 12 minutes on the phone with them you get written up. Poor work environment, feels like working in a prison."
bad,"they outsourced to another country, so we no longer had jobs here. while they were here I did enjoy the work it was versatile and I was able to do the rate based work quickly"
bad,You must have an extremely bubbly personality to work here and be very persuasive and convincing becauae your whole job is to keep Verizon customers happy even though you don’t have very much room to give them exactly what they want due to Verizon’s policies. Management is not very helpful. You must pass customer surveys while not being able to actually help the customers or else you will be fired. Customers are really rude and nasty and the job is very stressful
bad,The people there have no clue what a professional workplace culture entails.  Employees cuss like they are in a bar and some look like they've rolled out of bed and put on their pajamas to come to work.
bad,"My 3 year tenure started off good, but them was moved to another department that did not allow you the freedom to make decisions and help the clients without being questioned and service levels were the only thing that mattered"
bad,"Temporary position. No benefits, overtime, vacation or sick days. "
bad,You do not want to work for this company its all a set up. I would never want any of my family or friends to work for this company. They are actually closed down now.
bad,Many people were fired for fraud.  Many of those were superiors. Don't make too much money because they'll put your bonus on hold. Never was paid on time without explanation
bad,"The number of employees allowed to work depends on the call volume, and regularly, employees are sent home working less than 4 hours because of low call volume."
bad,Xerox was not a good place to work.  People were constantly getting fired and some oft he managerial staff was not helpful at all. The call center was way too hostile as well.
bad,"Entry level employees subject to schedule change inconsistencies and intermittent mandatory overtime or no overtime at all. Promotions are given after what is referred to as a ""trial period"" in the position which required all job responsibilities of the promotion without pay increase or any added benefits, but failing to pass the trial period would result in termination."
bad,"This job is very demanding which is great when you have good management!  It is a very political, stressful, non rewarding job.  Non- rewarding due to the fact that you NEVER get a thank you always the demand for more. If you do not meet the numbers they are looking for, you are penalized and put on the improvement list.  Never a thought of how the work comes to you and the research you may have to do to complete it so folks are paid.  It would be nice IF they hired folks that knew how to do the work themselves not just the political end. Most of the employees work very  very hard to full fill the obligation to the medical professional and the clients.  A lot of management will be nice to your face, if they speak to you at all, and will cut you off at the knees behind your back.  I was able to expand my knowledge of the Insurance medical field which I am very grateful for.  This is a goal. I have my billing and coding background so this was benificial."
bad,"Received encouragement to do calls."
bad,This is by far the Worse place I have ever worked. The Office manager is always in his office with the door closed. They treat you AWFUL at this office. Do Not Work Here !!!
bad,I feel training needs to be improved for incoming employees.  Supervisors and leadership needs to be better trained to inter act with employees. They pay is very low.  Far below average compared to local market.
bad,The work and stress does not make going to work fun at all.  this call center is a very stressful environment to work in. they don't give you the proper tools to get the job done.
bad,"Absolutely hated working for Xerox. Would not recommend the job to anyone. Stressful, high demand and low pay is involved. Work somewhere else if at all possible."
bad,Xerox couldn't get out of it's way to save it's life...   When I have to chase the company to bill my customers for work done and they didn't bill 250K for almost a year  and after the customers books had closed for that project year.... Just stupid people doing stupid stuff... Not very business like.
bad,Poor management that always takes advantage of employees and shows poor leadership and execution capabilities. No bonuses were paid out and employees were furloughed and went weeks without pay to cover the mistakes of leadership
bad,Company does not care about employees. Company employs people who are not fit for their positions. Employees are unprofessional and very disrespectful.
bad,If you are applying for a call center position rethink your options. The culture might be a bit different because the advisor work from home but it still can be very stressful.
bad,what else can i say i had to put a star or else i wouldn't have the management is UN professional. the place is basically a call center in frost burg MD for Florida blue health insurance customers who are getting robbed by their insurance company
bad,"Management was poorly trained."
bad,"Very stressful my sup.. Was mean and if u did something wrong she let the whole staff know! The pay was good, not sure if it was good enough to be treated the way u are buy customers or the managers ... I never hated a job more"
bad,"Xerox is not the company for me, they don't pay their employees all the time, the building is not very sanitary. "
bad,"Indiana Family Social service Center located in Crown Point, Indiana is not a career oriented place! Wages are not worth the stress or workload. Company policy are inconsistent and management is very unprofessional. They hire temps and the turn over ratio is high because no one can stay at this job. They do not offer incentives,pay increases and the health coverage is horrible! Employees are very rude and unprofessional. I feel sorry for people who have wasted years to work for the State of Indiana and service clients. This is a dead end job with no opportunities for advancement. If you do get promoted it only changes your job title and not your pay!!! This is a decent job for a college person or someone just starting to gain work experience but not a career to retire from."
bad,Different name same BS. Mandatory overtime. Management does not care about its employees. Overall I have been working for the last 25 years and this was the worst place I have ever worked.
bad,They train you for a few weeks at a slow pace then you have to listen to people complain while they dangle unreachable goals at you. They have a weekly witch hunt as you lie to your customers every minute.
bad,"Stressful day, pressure is constant and not worth the aggrevation of dealing with a management team that does NOT have it together. Hardest part of the job was dealing with a management team that formed their own cliques. Most enjoyable part was helping the clients when they called in. Resolving their issues!"
bad,"This job was not created for a mother or someone to support their family with. They wages were just above minimum wages, and they did not provide detailed training either."
bad,Xerox whom later changed to Conduent is interested in making profits not their employees.  Conduent is reducing their US work force by 40% in 2018.  Jobs are being pushed overseas.
bad,do not recommend unless your looking for a stressful job that is cut throat . there is room for advancement but that too is cut throat. you are just stuck on the phones to tell the customers what they want to hear.
bad,Company thought poorly of employees and treated their Puertorrican employees like garbage. Made us feel different and our benefits began to be cut off as time went by.
bad,I was not happy there. Very noisy and disorganized.  If you had a question you needed to wait until the lead or supervisor could be bothered to look your way.  It was very stressful.
bad,"The building was filthy, management and employees that had been there 1 yr + were miserable and rude. Many of my colleagues I went through training with had items including food stolen from them. They had headsets that were not specific to one person you had to bring in your own sanitation wipes and look for a headphone. I was out of training for a week before my manager introduced himself to me he has no idea I came to his team."
bad,"there wasn't a typical day at Xerox. Their computers were always breaking down and sometimes had to wait hours before the system was up and running."
bad,"A lot of promises, little follow through and not somewhere to work long term. Site closings due to losing clients is common. You cannot apply or transfer once you are provided a WARN notice."
bad,Compensation is  bad otherwise . PAP  department Managers treat employees like kids  High School. Not professional at all. Fights on floor and in parking lots
bad,"Hired me than laid me off 1 month later, not professional at all, false promotion of position, over staffing should not be allowed in any corporation,"
bad,"I would not recommend that anyone applies to work for this company. Employees are under paid, over worked, and treated very unfairly (to  say the very least). If management is witnessed doing anything unprofessional or unlawful, employees are expected to remain closed lipped."
bad,Management says one thing and does another. mandatory overtime is a constant with no notice given. Supervisors unwilling to do their jobs and goof off.
bad,"management is terrible"
bad,This was by far one of the most stressful and hostile work environment. The amount of demands and numbers you had to meet where realistic and sometimes cruel. Couldn't use the bathroom outside of your break like an animal
bad,"The management was promoted on friendship, not qualifications. The OM was racist and unethical, he would cheat customers out of money owed to them due to the effects on his ""stats"".  The company does not care about their customers, they only care about making the numbers to impress the client. If you would call the ethics line for anything, you would be terminated."
bad,I was cheated out of winnings in a competition they had and I would be written up for things I had no control over. They blamed us for bad customer experience when we didn't even communicate with the customer.
bad,Harrassed several times by an operations manager who finally exploited my anxiety aftet learning of it and fired me for having an anxiety attack on site.
bad,please do not ever work for condent. if you do good for you and good luck.  they do not train you enough for how rude customers are to you over the phones and the management doest help when you ask for help your on your own.
bad,They had one month training which did nothing for me. By the time i went out to take lives calls i had no idea what i was doing.. managers wouldn't help.
bad,They did not train very well at all. The managers didn’t have any control over their classrooms. The trainees would hit the floor and have NO CLUE what they were doing. Very unorganized work environment.
bad,"The management bad and the company was all over the place, no room for growth. Reps never recieved any kind of raises. I would not recommend this place."
bad,stressful and unprofessional. Supervisors have there favorites and they are always loud and rude. Mondays are the worst days to work. Call volume is sad
bad,Hated this place. I would not recommend anybody work at this company. It was not professional. The management and training was horrible. They don't prepare you enough or pay you enough to do what you do at the company.
bad,awful very bad. The company often felt like fraud. No HR present called HR they were located in the Philipines. Training was awful. I saw three fights among employees while working there. Only plus was they could not stay staffed so it was unlimited amounts of optional overtime. So you had to ability to earn very well
bad,"This place had multiple class action lawsuits for not paying their employees."
bad,I really have no comment one way or the other about this company. I worked there for a short time before the contract with the state ended. I moved to my current job.
bad,"This job was posting Texas child support payments. It was a good job but you  could work 12 hours on Mondays; as week proceeded by Friday you could work or not even work; in this job I never worked 40 hours....not because I didnt want to. One had to work 40 hours to eventually get benefits. It was a job that paid low also and then if you  made errors, after a period  of time, they would deduct your hourly pay."
bad,"Customers were abusive with language. I was threatened and harassed on many occasions."
bad,"This job pays minimum wage with zero benefits, no sick days and no paid vacation. I got one week of unpaid vacation last year. I would be better off working at a grocery store. The only part of the job that I enjoy is that I work Monday to Friday."
bad,Xerox is a great place to get sales training but after that you are on your own. As an equal opportunity company you often find yourself working for a minority who is not qualified for the job. Most young people come to Xerox for the sales training and to put their Xerox employment on their resumes creating a revolving door for the sales force
bad,"in a whole i would not recommend my friend or family member to work there. i did not feel safe, no job security, and drama everyday, even if you try and stay to yourself."
bad,The company does not encourage a work and life balance.  It has not given raises to the employees for multiple years in a row.  The benefits are extremely poor.  It requires work on national holidays and weekends for staff that is M-F and normal business hours.
bad,"This place will work you to death. They do not give you a raise and expect you to work overtime. It is promise to be a team environment and family friendly, but that is not the truth."
bad,"A typical work day would consist of taken up to 20-30 calls per hour."
bad,"The pay was great, but the management and supervisors were not willing to help or overturn failed surveys. When you ask for help, the supervisors were not willing to come help, yet they want us to take ownership of the calls so if we failed a survey, it'll be on us and not on supervisors because they're not willing to offer the services that the customers need or even compromise on the situation"
bad,department was giving a 4 day notice that the contract was ending. ws told on a monday that come friday we will not have a job. no one communicated that it was a temp position when i accepted the job.
bad,"The management did not know what they were doing"
bad,"answering the phone for customers, assisting them with their medication , talking to them on the phone about their problems, trying to provide excellent customer service"
bad,typical day was helping customers that called in. I learned about the different aspects of Verizon. The management at Xerox was good. the workplace culture was friendly and helpfull.
bad,poor place to work !!! disorganized  too much pressure to do things exactly perfect per the Department of Health !!  too much focus on training !!! never went Live ! everyone pushed out contract was lost at Xerox !!!
bad,I wanted a better salary for myself. Met some really awesome people along the way.The commute was not bad at all for me on a daily basis. Nothing more to say.
bad,Horrible place to work.  Mean-spirited angry wannabe important Directors with egos that are a mile high.  They treat the managers and staff as if they are roadkill.
bad,I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone relative to the call center part of Xerox. Your time while there watches you to the second. Every second you are there.
bad,I do not or would not tell anyone to work at this stressful environment they only care about the money they and bring and do not care about there employees
bad,"One of the worst jobs I have ever had, the lack of team work, the lack of management, and the lack of professionalism.... I had never worked in a situation of such disarray."
bad,This is a great place for kids who need work right out of high school or retirees that are just trying to keep busy. No benefits or long term benefits.
bad,Never received supervisor salary and over worked with nothing to show fir manager was afraid that i would take her job due to my excellent performance rate with my team so she got me fired
bad,"worst company I have ever had the displeasure to work in, the management is a total joke, the reps can not do their jobs if the supervisors do not do theirs!"
bad,management had favorites which cause a lot of unnecessary stress and anxiety on others to work ten times harder to barely get noticed. management had a lack of communication.
bad,"it was fast paced and calls were back to back, management was awful they were very rude and discriminating when they brought in the new ops manager when I first started before the new ops manager came in it wasn't so bad. Hours were your basic 9 hours with an hour lunch but you had mandatory overtime that you had to do before or after your shift so you averaged 50+ hours a week but the Xerox I worked at is no longer in business"
bad,"Poor management, was falsely accused of something I didn't do and so I ended up getting fired and was denied for unemployment. I would not refer anyone to work there!"
bad,I would not  recommend working at  Xerox  due to  poor management  and   customer  abusive  calls  to  Xerox  for  below minimum wage   pay the  place is   always  cold
bad,"A typical day at work was loud, fast-paced and rude management."
bad,terrible place to work management sucks the environment is horrible and the is to many politics when it comes to advancement and raises the companies management team  doesn't treat their employees as they should
bad,If you are needing something quick to make money and not a permanent job Xerox is a good place. Managers are poorly trained. Employees are treated very poorly. Training is horrible. No pay raises.
bad,I did not like working there.  I could not wait to leave but got laid off instead.  They did me a favor laying me off.  I did not like working there.  Terrible!!
bad,Horrible management. Drama filled workplace. People are always getting into verbal and physical altercations. Pay is not enough for the work you do. Favoritism is shown among managers also.
bad,"Slums of all call centers. You're critiqued by angry people and if you can't make them happy, you get a pay DECREASE. You can spend a month getting great scores and may make past minimum wage, the second someone says they're mad and puts it into the survey database, you're down to minimum wage. Shift bids are a joke, with 500 other reps it's basically seniority, but no one is stupid enough to be there long enough to get seniority to actually get a decent shift. Never again."
bad,The Job is awful. Yu cant use the restroom without asking someone to go. The pay rate is very low and management sits back and mess with the calls allowing people to get more or less calls a day which hinders your pay.
bad,its a good place to get your feet wet into the industry but for everything else its just terrible. the management was just awful. they care about numbers more than anything and would keep pushing you
bad,"Here at Dominican Republic, Xerox is one of the worst places to work. They just don't care about their employees, the management talks to you like you are an animal."
bad,the managers at Xerox needs people skills the only great thing going for them is that they will let you take off as much as needed but as far as the managers go they really suck at what they do truth is the light of the world............letting it shine
bad,"I didn't get the chance to really see what the culture was about, as I was just temporarily placed there from college placement. I can't really accurately describe the work place, as it was about 12 years ago."
bad,poor and very stressful work environment.  The managers were messy and they gossip a lot. they run from work just as soon as you raise your hand for help.
bad,"The position of Customer Service Specialist was of a temporary nature, however, the company would hire individuals in as temporaries with the possibility of obtaining full-time employment. I applied for different positions (full-time) but none were offered to me. Thus I do not believe that the company was serious about offering full-time positions as it would have had to provide benefits and therefore would be costly."
bad,"This was the worse job ever for me, as I was struggling for work, was told temp to perm. They never gave us anything to work with but a binder and intense training. We had to bring our own office equipment."
bad,"Most of the people who were management here had little to no experience at how to be a manager.  Even though I worked there, I cannot fathom how there was never a performance review or a raise.The call center was outsourced to Manilla."
bad,I felt very uncomfortable being forced to sell phone lines to customers who called in to cancel a line because they couldn't afford it or a family member had just died. Most of the time our options were not good enough for them and I wanted to respect that but my work environment paid no attention to the realness of financial hardship
bad,I've worked in corporate most of my career and there is not a balance for all employees.  There are different rules for corporate employee and the employees working in other areas.
bad,It was awful. Did not thoroughly train employees & very poor management. I could go on and on but it's not worth the effort. I would never return to this place.
bad,"The call center is overloaded with people. The ""Lead's"" don't want to do their job and disobey the company's policy every chance they get. The pay is horrible. The environment is very stressful, unorganized and has no structure."
bad,"There was much lack of support from management.  Goals were set but the tools to meet those goals were not given.  First call resolution was expected but there were disciplinary actions taken for taking the time to achieve this resolution. Many customer service representatives would transfer calls to keep from taking care of the needs of the caller and/or just hang up on them.  Hold times for the clients was usually very long and by the time they would actually get a ""real person"" on the line they were very upset because they had called several times and their issue was still not resolved."
bad,"Between the bathrooms and everyone's lack of personal hygiene, it smelled awful. Hardly any support, wouldn't aline with supervisors, so would have days or hours with no support because other supervisors would hardly help. All they cared about was surveys. Management was horrid."
bad,They was very unprofessional. The management was not helpful. Barely trained. New supervisors how to be a better supervisor. There was alot of unprofessional help period
bad,"no employee retention, no growth opportunity, no leadership, very high employee turnover, politics, classic corporate america. low margins on projects, no work life balance"
bad,Terrible place to work period! Discrimination reports are retaliated to the person who reported. Their attendance policy is for ppl with no life! I would not recommend this company to anyone!
bad,"This place is sooooo very stressful, I worked on the Verizon account some time ago, management was not aligned and not supportive at all. This center was transitioned from USCC, transitioning from that culture to Xerox which at the time we were advised had similar cultures and values to such a mess....if your a seasoned professional please don't waste your time, that place is certainly for kids looking to make money for college."
bad,"The interview was a farce.  I was hired as a billing specialist for the Sprint project.  I was lied to from the get go.  It was not until the 3rd week of training, we were informed we would be required to sell products, fix telephones and deal with many other issues.  The job entailed NOTHING for which i interviewed."
bad,"A company in a declining market that manages by unrealistic expectations and changes of top executives annually. "
bad,"worst place I have ever worked... completely bias, if you are a woman or a minority they will love you here... If you are a hard worker be prepared to be completely screwed over and never get a thing you deserve."
bad,Training was great very extensive. But once thats over you may as well be working from home because there was no support. Managers were on there phones or outside. I have epilepsy and the lights were never maintained so i was having aeizures about everyday. Then i had to deal with insults such as people calling me twitchy.
bad,"Fast paced call center for Verizon. leads/managers are nice. But your employment, as well as your pay is based on surveys. you can work 12 hour shifts (mandatory) and still make only minimum wage. pro/con is that if you miss a day of work, you have to make it up. Say you went on vacation (if it is even approved) for 2 weeks. thats 80 hours. you have to add those hours to the end of your work day and only have a certain time to make them up (before the pay period is over)"
bad,"They entice you and say you can make your own salary, you are paid on abc, which was piece work, then they change it when to many people were make an decent salary. Management made it so that now instead of getting paid a specific amount per case you finish ($10), they tell you, you have to finish 2 cases and hour everyday for a month to make $14 an hour. This part of the company was contracted out for NJFC, and what the public dose not know is that the reason their stuff is done incorrectly is because the company is worried about production, production and scream accuracy , but you cant rush or you may do something wrong, and if you dont rush you wont make any money. These are the things they dont tell in training.. If you are lucky you make enough and move to a different position where you dont have to worry about your income changing, but the down fall is you dont get a raise .."
bad,Glad this place went out of business. That should say enough for the work environment.  It was horrible with minimal pay and huge job expectations.   NO
bad,Awful place its disgusting the supervisors are corrupted and chose favorite the customers are rude and you aren't trained properly so you never know how to do your job correctly and that can also cost you your job.
bad,"Answering phones, on one campaign I learned different software,the next one I learn all about why sometime they will not approve the medication you take."
bad,"It's a fast paced environment and can be fun at times. Some supervisors are micromanagers, we're undersupplied and undertrained. Some days are longer than others and the customers can be a bit aggressive."
bad,"Terrible, managers suck, pay suck, supervisors suck, and the upper management suck. They are inconsiderate, selfish, and expect CSR's, and tl's to do everything while they sent in their offices or desk all day doing nothing."
bad,"This job was terrible the training sucked!! and the supervisor only ever yelled at everyone for doing things wrong, but could never show anyone how to fix mistakes."
bad,Management are very unprofessional. I would never work there again. There is a lot of drama and changes going on at that place. People do and say what they want and very little authority.
bad,"There is not much of a work/life balance.  Even if you go above an beyond and exceed expectations, you do not get a pay increase.   They tend to have layoff and put employees on furloughs without warning or  give a decent severance package.   Not much of a job culture, you work 10-14 hours a day because they are under staffed and Management is out-of-touch with their employees."
bad,I was hired on for technical support on the overnight team. I never received my shift differential. We were doing our Prepaid for Verizon. The whole night it was people asking for credit's on their account. I had to find work very fast because of this place.
bad,Has horrible management. This job does not pay you for the hard work you will be completing. Management does not acknowledges your job well done. Job should have better professionalism.
bad,"Very busy, high volume call center for Sam's Club customers. Very stressful with the majority of unhappy Sam's Club members calling with complaints with the store and management."
bad,rood supervisors too much gossip going around and not professional at all work environment was hostile and people arguing all around. sat around during training with nothing to do
bad,i will not work here ever again . nothing was under control and to raise hand to use bathroom. never got proper training. ever rude customers and supervisors never helped out
bad,Not very people oriented. They have a huge turn around time and it is constant. It is hard to get to know anyone and very fast paced. If you like that it is for you.
bad,"	Customer Service representative for Aetna Health in a call center setting"
bad,"Commerciale sédentaire"
bad,They completely sold the cake the first few weeks before training. when you hit the floor management doesn't care about anything that happens on the floor. you only have so much time on the phone calls.
bad,Horrible Place to work. Management was not decent and could not express your opinions about anything in the workplace. Co-workers were very unprofessional at times.
bad,"terrible management"
bad,"When I worked for the company ""MY"" manager didn't even help the team to the point another manager had to step in. The company also wont pay for moves when they offer you a position that requires you to move."
bad,"I did not mind the paid training, on how to navigate the various systems. I was not a fan of the headsets that you had to ware all the time. You were only given two 15 minute breaks. I just thought it was stressful."
bad,"No consistency, with hoping you can keep your job. Job security is not there."
bad,Had very rude know it all supervisors who were young and didn't know anything about life or business. Know one to really help when systems went down. It's very difficult no structure.
bad,"Constant restructuring and lay-offs; little to no communications across divisions,or even departments, makes for a lack of cohesion and an often difficult work environment."
bad,No comment . Just know all administrative positions will be in Guatemala .  Positions have been moving there since 2015 many employees in the US have lost or are loosing their jobs
bad,my position was being down-graded and my manager wasn't interested in providing me career advancement. During my career I had 10 mangers so there was high turn-over.
bad,This is the most horrible job you will even encounter. I worked there for four years. Getting out of bed was a challenge. They fire good management and keep evil people.... like tink. If you work there.... beware of *ink. She's pure evil.. I fortunate never worked under *ink but holy Jesus she's evil... I was a supervisor. Trust me. I don't know why she still has a job... this job will suck your soul. If you're okay with that... the overtime is great!
bad,No team environment... Always hiring because everyone is mistreated and not giving enough or good training. I enjoyed it! Caught on and even got promoted because I worked overtime and participated in everything. I moved back to Dallas but they are not able to hold employees. Again always having to hire. Poor Management!
bad,"Xerox India is not good place to work, work environment is not good. Very unprofessional managers and senior management and HR policies. Think before joining xerox/conduent"
bad,Taking calls from members and medical providers. It paid the bills but the management wasn't so great. I  needed a full time job and they hired me on the spot
bad,"i do not feel like this should be required to complete this application "
bad,"I was not a fan of working here, it was just the easiest thing to do while pregnant with my first child. "
bad,Verbally abused by all the leads and managers there as well as continuos negative people. As well forced to work terrible hours that make it so you can't have a healthy personal life balance.
bad,"the place was non friendly, all white walls, the mgt was satanic."
bad,Xerox was not a good company to work for. They were very interested in their bottom line and were not concerned with the amount of employee turn over.
bad,"large  turnover, constant hour changes, supervisors changing, goals required to be met never the same, boss bragging about having a gun,  days always shifting"
bad,"lack of communication between management, supervisors, and employees. With NO chance of advancement within company, no acknowledgement of a good job done."
bad,"The work is very easy and easy to learn. However the work environment is stressful, very negative attitudes from workers and management as well. No room to grow pay could be better for the amount of work you do."
bad,"The job was unorganized and unfair and didn't pay their employees fairly. I worked benefits, claims, enrollment, and payments, and was a team lead and never received a raise or even a bonus. Then they grade their employees while training them new material."
bad,"When hiring me, promises were made verbally that I should have had in writing. In addition, the marketing manager went by the book in hours worked. If you had a doctor's appointment, you had to make up the time before the next payroll issue.  "
bad,"i wish i could give this less of a review, if you dont get it you get no support and get laughed at pretty much, management is a bunch of stuck up people thinking their all that and more"
bad,"Bezahlung sehrbescheiden....."
bad,"Es wird vom Arbeitnehmer sehr sehr viel abverlangt und es kommt definitiv zu wenig zurück. Man bekommt keine Zuschläge für Überstunden, keine Zuschläge für Sonn-oder Feiertagsarbeit. Jeder Tag im Jahr wird als ein Werktag gehandhabt. Gesetzliche deutsche Feiertage gelten nicht. Einzige Ausnahme ist Heiligabend und Neujahr. Würde am liebsten 0 Sterne vergeben"
bad,I Gave almost 11 years of my life to a company to get let go and find out I was not up for rehire. At Xerox I worked hard for the company and was never showed any respect and any care are concern. I will never tell any of my friends are family about this company
bad,I would never recommend this employer to anybody. They do not work with peoples schedules. They do not care if you are sick and cannot work. Overall horrible company.
bad,not good with employees didn't treat them fair at all. Unpaid and overworked honestly. Loved monday to friday work and off by 4:30 pm but the work was always whatever I tell you to do. Even if it is not in your job desciption.
bad,The job was slow and the training did not focus on anything relevant to the job itself. Most of the training was focused on legalities. We were graded and none of my calls reached the required grade for retention. I lost motivation and dreaded going to work each day.
bad,"Management is not supportive, performance metrics are not consistent the daily work culture is stressful along with the compensation being significantly below market rate. Many of the positions are on an outsource basis so there is very little room for advancement."
bad,Do not expect a raise. Unfortunately there is no room for growth here. The overall environment is negative. Everyone feel overworked and underpaid and it is obvious. It is very  dis hardening how unhappy the majority of the staff is that works there.
bad,"This was a in between job. I must say that I actually learned a lot but the overall culture of the organization was not very good. Management not friendly, hardly no interaction with staff. Most of the trainers were very good in teaching to make sure you had a good understanding of what was needed to perform your duties."
bad,This company hours are horrible required to work 730am to 530pm every day. They also micro manage their employees and the commission structure is terrible.
bad,"worst experience in my life. worst job I have ever worked, they promote how they are more then willingly there to help. but let me tell as soon as you are on the floor accepting those calls you are on your own"
bad,"This place expects you to train new employees who are then signed on to make more money than you for doing the same job. Full of managers and supervisors who lie to your face. Payroll issues that were never resolved. Recruiting will hire anyone with a pulse. Frequently smoking marijuana in the parking lot. Arguments and physical fights in the parking lots and restrooms. "
bad,Paid piece work for the work that I did. 19 cents a claim. I am not interested in helping anyone else find a job except for me. It is only paid by piece work. I do not want to help anyone else find a job but me.
bad,"do not work here, here, pay is terrible and  building is to gheto,"
bad,There are no windows so you're sitting in a giant box all day.  You have to also leave all your belongings in a locker outside of the actual call center.  This is because the people that have been hired there have been so unreliable and dishonest that there have been quite a few cases of theft.
bad,"Equipment never works, and center manager never cares. Come to work daily and chairs are broken, computers are broken. While the Waldo Canyon fire evacuation was active we were made to work through it, and the police had to actually come escort us off the premises---management did not care!"
bad,not job security is a call center and you have to deal with a lot of people who don't respect others and sometimes the managers are in relationship with employees and favoritism
bad,this company has a high turnover rate the environment mimics the environment of a high school. Qualified people are passed over for promotions and promotions are given to the most popular. This company hires a lot of people that bring drama to the job site. The upside to this job is that sometimes they do offer unlimited over time.
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"Arrive at work knowing what my whole day would be like."
bad,"The company treats you like dirt amongst more dirt. After working for Xerox, I understand what may have happened to cause one of the offices to burn down in Lacey, WA."
bad,Not client focused or employee focused.  Workplace culture is dog eat dog and the best ideas do not win out. Management was new and dis organized.  Lessons were not learned by management and they will make the same mistakes again.
bad,OK job but the people there aren't good to work with the supervisor doesn't really help not a good pay rate for what you do there the hours aren't fair and the benefits
bad,"Do not work here. Managers are rude and do not care about employees. They downsize once a month.  Very high turnaround."
bad,Xerox went from a great place to work to a terrible place to work. They do not have a clear direction as to where they are going and do not treat employers with respect anymore.
bad,this is the worse place to work . They tell you what you want  to hear just to get you in the door. They have all this mandortory OT only to put anyone on the chopping block without reason year after year
bad,"Doing my job & others job,not compensated for it.  Haven't had a raise in 2 years; Management shows favoritism; Health insurance is horrible; Improve."
bad,"Very stressful, not a lot of down time to assist current and new agents, This company it not something that I would recommend, the job has no support for agents or family"
bad,"Disrespectful, offensive, and unprofessional. Did not even provide chairs for new hires. Many had to sit on the floor and weren't given computers. Paychecks were always late."
bad,"I worked at Xerox full-time (Less than a year)"
bad,"They care nothing about they employees, they just change to Coduent, they keep changing your shift every 3 months, Ihad 5 different shift  in 5 months I finally left, this place makes you sick."
bad,"Management unprofessional,there was no foundation and you had to know somebody to move forward didn't matter about your attendance or performance.. the place has potential but in need of a makeover"
bad,It's a nice workplace very nice people. The pay is not great. the benefits are not bad. It's a very productive work environment. The onsite training is very nice.
bad,Working at Xerox provides a stressful work environment. The pay is not good enough for the situations you have to deal with. I would only recommend for somebody with a high stress tolerance.
bad,It was a learning experience. I don't think they had things in order there. Some of the department leaders were not trained correctly. They were so shorthanded from a layoff before I got there they let anyone become a management. No rules were enforced for everyone.
bad,"This company hires young aggressive non-whites then pushes whites out the door without second thought."
bad,Xerox was not a fun place to work at. You always wondered what extreme measure they were going to take in order to force you to take as many calls and not humanly possible. Everyday you walked in and wondered what Co-Worker you would never see again. They always had far to high expectation based on every situation.
bad,"Working for Xerox was at first not a bad job. the first day of training we found out that our supervisors was also training with us which did not make sense, how can a supervisor help if they themselves just got hired?"
bad,very childish managers and supervisors and many people who get to do things managers should be doing with out the credit. the pay rate varies and therefore not a steady pay.
bad,This was a temporary job (6 mo).  The supervisors were not very friendly nor were they helpful.  It was a stressful job because they wanted you to complete task that you had not been fully trained to do.
bad,"When asking for help, there was no one that was willing to take the time. It was a ""figure it out yourself"" environment. High stress work environment. Low pay. Benefits were extremely expensive."
bad,No room for growth and some Management need to take courses on how to deal with their employees and they DON'T do raises. In conclusion I wouldn't recommend that place at all.
bad,"Like Alorica, the work environment and stability is very unsecure, with few prospects for any career advancement.  This position was dedicated exclusively to handle customer problems, with almost a o% prospect of obtaining any additional sales for commission, and generally the few of losing a very unsatisfied customer with every call."
bad,I work making copy of original documents and putting paper in a book and looking over documents to check for mistake that's some people made on the papper
bad,"This is a company that has a very high negative environment.  If you want to be treated like a child, this place is for you.  This company does not offer much in career opportunities if you are not deemed a favorite.  The inside has very poor lighting as they cannot afford to replace the light bulbs.  No natural light from windows as they keep the blinds shut.  The bathrooms are filthy.  You are expected to just sit there in-between phone calls with nothing to do but stare at a computer screen."
bad,"Terrible please to work.You are never to get a raise, unless you get promoted, but don't expect to be promoted if you are not black. Racist towards white people!!!"
bad,"Could do better with compensation, hours, and the way staff is treated when they are going above and beyond for them. Unless you have a solid understanding of their culture just keep your head down and work don't go above and beyond it is not appreciated."
bad,"Job was alright, training was not that great and supervisors not knowledgable.  They were always on their phones and it always seemed like they were just guessing.  Says you can earn more but actually your forced to move into a different department with no pay raise.  My god supervisors were earning the same amount that i was they just had a title.  Most peope that worked there were hella ratchet, and the bathrooms do not work."
bad,I learn at this place that if you become a best friend of someone in upper management they will promote you up fast. No matter how many years you have with them they have preferences.
bad,"Low pay, unprofessional,  gossip. No room for pay raise, they lie and dont care. People dress as they Eagle up.  A lot of  jealousy and dirty looks and women dress like they are at a club with 10 inch heels and short dresses and skirts. Just a ghetto place all around"
bad,"Interview is not what you do. Mandatory overtime, they do not care if you have a family emergency, be prepared to keep to yourself. Everyone wants to be in your business. Good luck"
bad,worst work places would never rec. when getting hurt my superviser told me I should just quite and not come back only out for them selfs they never tried to help me grow with the work place
bad,"the company takes care of their customers but refuses to take care of their employees. never work here, it is the absolute worst"
bad,"Company is extremely strict, one late or absence can cost you your job. Having a cell phone will cost you your job, don't trust anyone, not even the managers, everyone is a snitch in this company and will do anything to keep their job/get promoted, training is useless and doesn't correlate to working on the phones. you'll be fired before you get promoted in this company. Training begins early in the morning at around 5am, if you manage to stay awake for the few weeks of training, take the pay and leave, this company doesn't care about it's employees and will replace you in a minute."
bad,"lousy compensation, horrible benefits, be prepared to have your paycheck messed with. management does not give a darn about you, once you are hired you are nothing more than a number."
bad,very pitiful this is a sad company to work for and i feel sorry for anybody who try and and get a job here!!! please dont work here
bad,Company is very unorganized and does not appreciate employees at all. Management team is not knowledgeable of products or policies
bad,"I loved my co workers at Xerox, but its a very unorganized workplace. The company was not concern about school schedules and the pay was always a problem such as incentives."
bad,"*A typical work day is busy with provider calls "
bad,"A typical day of work included taking at minimum 150 calls per day, making sure to keep your talk time low as well as not to fail any surveys because they effect you boss whom in turn will be very displeased should they lose it, Management was very unorganized and the turn over rate was so high, you may have had a new manager every month. The hardest part of the job was that the environment wasn't enjoyable, its easier to deal with a demanding job if the environment is nice and the people you work with are great; neither were found with this position. Overall they offered a lot of overtime, so this is a great place to work if you can keep up and need the money."
bad,"no chance for advancement; terrible management; too many people who just don't care... easy money, but daily pep talks just to convince myself to go back in!"
bad,"The company was new to Charlotte, NC and needless to say no one knew what they were doing. I asked specific questions prior to being hired about mandatory overtime, and was told there would be no mandatory overtime only voluntary. Well for 2 months there was mandatory overtime until 8 pm and I was told during interviewing that overtime would end at 5 pm when doctors offices closed. There were issues with shifts, call out procedures and management. They promoted their friends instead of people who were actually qualified and had the required experience. When I heard a member of Management say ""I'm just walking around to see who I can intimidate"" I knew my time was coming to an end there. I lasted their first year although my job was constantly being dangled over my head because we went from servicing clients to servicing providers. We had to undergo new training and pass or lose our jobs. How is that when this is not the job I applied for? I already passed the tests for the job I applied for. I just hope that location has gotten better."
bad,Worst company I ever worked for. Mangers are not very understanding  and  very mean to employees. The only good thing about the company is you get a paycheck .
bad,I have learned a lot working in this position for this employer. I learned to multitask and increase my typing and communication skills as well as active listening.etc. Very high call volume and short breaks. No opportunities to grow.
bad,this is not a good job. Do not pay enough. Treats employees poorly. The upper management has favorites with certain employees. The bonus decreased from five hundred to two hundred fifty dollars.
bad,"If you like drama, violence and harassment well then this is the place for you! If you like seeing law enforcement at your job well again this is definitely the place for you!"
bad,It was the worst job ever. One employee stalked me and threatened me did nothing. The place was so trashy and no raises ever. Also benefits after 6 months....My degree says I'm better than this.
bad,This company didnt pay me for about 40 hours of work as well as many other employees that were in my training group. I learned how to oprate phones in a call center and provide people with food stamps who had gone through a disaster.
bad,"The most casual badly run company in the history of Australian business."
bad,needs more training hours for incoming employees. my class was kind of rushed to the floor. I seen people go to break and never come back. IMPROVEMENTS need to be made
bad,Not what i am looking for. Not a good environment. Can move up if you work hard. Training process is not great...does not prepare you for the actual job
bad,"Xerox has such a high turnover it's obnoxious. If you love your sanity then do not work here. If you feel like torturing yourself, knock yourself out here."
bad,I worked there from April 22nd to 11/02/2015. Americans need work to.  My job was sent overseas to be done cheaper. 34 years working for Suntrust then symcor then xerox. And laid off. We need work to. Sorriest place to work for and management was no help what so ever. Picked on by team leaders and co workers. Never would I recommend someone to work there. Sorriest company on earth.
bad,"management does not care about their employees at all. If they do not like you for any reason they go out of their way to make your life hard, or if you are friends with a person they don't like. it is a state contract job and they only want you to do your job half way. favoritism is rampant throughout the workplace and management does not know how each location operates. employees are not trained to properly do the job. no advancement and they do not give raises."
bad,"good, nice people to work with but  not enough training, unable to upgrade customer with no knowledge of codeing and system"
bad,"I enjoy my leadership team and coaching and developing my agents. I don't care much for my upper management, they lack empathy towards their supervisor team and there is a lack of morale overall at the job."
bad,"They treat you horrible and don't care what you have to say. They never see what good you are doing at your job, only what you're not doing. I couldn't work there anymore."
bad,"I worked there for a year and a half very poor management You can ask a supervisor a question and they never know the answer. Stressful and drama environment all upper management talk about each other and complain about eacother to employees about work not getting done. They expect you to never ever  be a minute late ( like we can controle weather, highway crashes etc.) and never miss even if family emergencies."
bad,Company itself offers decent benefits. Hired us at a certain time as to not offer us holiday pay it was all a strategy they planned to hire tech support reps for the iPhone 7 release.
bad,This job is mainly for people just graduating from High School. They pay very little. The staff seems disconnected from their team and not enough training.
bad,All they care about is stats and if you are good at what you do but stats are not what they want then they fire you and lie about why and the pay is NOT competitive.
bad,I was a freshmen in college when I started at Xerox and they told me that they would work around my school hours and when it came to finals my supervisor pretty much gave me the option to choose work or school for which is more important.
bad,"very unprofessional, so much drama, more like being in high school rather than being at work. There was also a very turn around, during my training classes we went through 3 different teachers withing 3 months"
bad,"Nothing about this place was pleasant, from the lack of breaks off the phones, to pay scale, to the favoritism that was shown to very few.  Your skills and knowledge meant nothing to this company."
bad,"Very layed back easy work. Management has their days. Poor communication skills, and employee courtesy. Most employees are in their very early 20's and have a lack of work ethic. Hardest part of the job would probably be when the machine is not working correctly. They do not have many incentives. NO raises or any kind of employee appreciation except pizza delivered maybe once a month."
bad,"The work itself isn't bad, it's the management that makes this place unbearable. They promote people with no management skills, soft skills, or empathy.  They don't work to maintain associates, benefits are a joke, and it feels more like a clique rather than a work place. They randomly choose which rules to enforce  and with whom they will enforce them with. Sink or swim mentality with little to no support. If you can get a job anywhere else, I would highly suggest it."
bad,"Can't advance unless you kiss butt, only certain people who are best friends can move up. Never worked for a place like this and never again. Bad management. Benefits are horrible. High turnover."
bad,"It was the worst 10 months ever. I was mad everyday and it raised my blood pressure. I didnt enjoy working there. The management is a joke and turn around rate is outrageous. If they stop feeding the new hires pizza and donuts everyweek to cover up lies and deception that this place was a good place to work, maybe just maybe they could keep their other employees happy. Stop worrying about my starbucks cup on my desk and pay me more for the under appreciated work i am doing instead of worrying about petty things. Run a functional business and not this horrendous storm you call a business opportunity."
bad,I used to work here. It is horrible. The pay isn't worth the abuse the job takes on your mental health. Never again will I work for them. They pay you the minimum they think they can get away with and then kick you when your down.
bad,"Terrible company to work for. they offer you employment for up to six moth project base and you will be lucky if you are of the like of the employer and last a month. do not trust them when they offer you job, you will found out how shady they are when they hire you. they don't tell you that after the training if you did not do 90 or above in a test, but excel in  the customer service job and taking care of the customer for them is more important how you do on a test than actually performing you job."
bad,"I read the reviews, but I still took a chance that it would be different for me. The work is oppressive; your schedule is oppressive; the place is oppressive. The job wasn't hard, but it would have been a whole lot easier if the training had been worthwhile. The permanent employees, and the returning temps are unhappy, burnt out and paranoid. and they should be. They seem to be managed by people who have had no formal training. They, too, are burnt out, and it shows. I never heard one kind or encouraging word spoken about myself, or any other employee. Managers perceive their job is to break your spirit, catch you doing things wrong, and make you believe you aren't good enough to go anywhere else. The managers gossip about the employees and about each other, and worse, pit employees against each other. Tattle tailing is encouraged and rewarded. Apparently that's the only fast track to a promotion. Communication is guarded at all levels. It's more important that no one knows your department's business, than departments working together. There is constantly some lay-off, or reorganization, or shakedown in the works. Why bother? You cannot win here."
bad,"Not a good idea to work with if you are planning to retire from this company or to look for career advancement"
bad,"Not a company that cares about employee needs. Stressful and hostile work environment for entry level employee, pay and benefits also not competitive."
bad,this was not a good place to work as they were not willing to accomodate my needs to go to work and to complete school as well.  i approached them with my needs and was willing to work extra hours on other days to make up for the hours that i needed off and they told me to pick either work or school.
bad,"When I say 12 dollars, I mean it. That's all you will make. Unless you make friends with someone in management, then you can get some side deals where they add hours to your check. "
bad,mean clients and family member took advantage of you had you do thing that you arent suppose to do it was very yucky job wouldn't recommend it to anyone
bad,"A typical day at work is working until all of the work is completed, even if it is past the average 8 hour shift or less. You work at your own pace. The pay is based on your production. There is no way to keep track of your transactions, so you never know how much money you are making."
bad,"Managers and supervisors had very poor communication, breaks are very short. Agents are expected to take on going abuse from ungrateful customers who yell and curse at you when you cannot bring their bill down. Managment shows a likeing to sertain emolyess and alows them to get away with murder.."
bad,"Xerox is a fortune five hundred company that has great potential however working in the Madison, MS location does not live up to the corporations core values. Management are not properly trained and the hardest part of the job is not getting the same information communicated regardless of how many supervisors or senior agents that you contacty"
bad,"Pushy people, very negative in performance counseling  even if you were doing well in all areas you were told you needed to do better to make up for the rest of the team."
bad,"not a nice place or nice people very dirty and supervisors and management are extremely rude its a dirty environment very dusty and unsanitary, they have bed bugs and mice."
bad,They don't care about there employees what's so ever. I needed to go to the hospital one day while I was at work and they wouldn't let me go other wise I would have gotten fired. you were never allowed to take time off of work even if you had PTO.
bad,The worst part of my day is at Xerox. The management is very unprofessional and they pay is a guessing game each pay period.
bad,"The place is a joke!! Dirty , nasty dirty! Training is pointless and unorganized. Good luck finding equipment that will work consistently and properly. It's not uncommon to have to try 3 different stations just to find a working computer/headset just to start your shift. Dress code does not apply to "" the cool kids"". It's like high school but worse! Honestly can't believe the place is still open. Did I mention how filthy it is??!!"
bad,"Xerox since many years cant make up its mind about its business. the endless changes inside Xerox keep fueling discontent, cutting corners to save pennies, depending on job agencies, high employee turnover, long long working hours, making staff work from home even after full shift at workplace and even from hospital beds and paying literally peanuts!!! "
bad,"First you are paid based on productivity which they call an ""abc"" method.  What it actually means is if you make your quota it will continuously be raised so you just barely make over minimum wage.  There is unfair favoritism and the people who have worked the least amount of time do the most work and receive the least amount of pay. You work many hours but do not receive adequate pay for the time you work.  Be smart don't even waste your time and energy with Xerox.  It is a scam of a job to get tax breaks for keeping jobs here but cheat workers out of their rightful pay with a bully ""abc"" joke of a method."
bad,"sans commentaire"
bad,Bad place always watched and not giving the time you need to do a good job take to long on notes and they are calling you on your work phone telling you to hurry and you are wasting Time stressful and mind numbing
bad,"The work day is steady with filling customer orders, fixing paper jams, and stocking supplies. If you are a good worker who does above and beyond for customers, they will show more appreciation than my coworkers. I was an employee with Xerox a year and about to get a pay raise when they fired me for no reason. I learned later I got hired so a managers friend could work there. For this I can't recommend this company to anyone looking for job security or an advancement in their career."
bad,"The best part of the job is the coworkers, besides that the pay isn't nearly enough for the emotional abuse workers take from Sprint violated many, as well as America's over privileged. It's awful, or at least it is for many of us who do not have thick skin"
bad,"Company laid everyone off when we thought the meeting was about a raise in pay. 30 minute lunch was not enough time to eat, management was never available to the employees"
bad,Working here was the worst decision i ever made.  The supervisor i had was disrespectful to her employees.  She would constantly down put her team rather than give them encouragement.
bad,"In the area in which I was employed employees will not report any inconsistencies because no action will be taken.  If action is taken it is not enforced.  Also, management tend to show some employees better treatment over others."
bad,"Bad place to work"
bad,"Only if you're young and stupid  will you be fine..Operations manager is like 25-30 which seems to screw up a lot from what I can see, they only want the young(because they seem to think they can get over on them) or the busy bodies. YOU will never get more than 80 hours PTO(that is not granted is worked for 3.8 hours a pay period) which includes vacation, sick and personal day all wrapped  up into one. They come around twice a day with large handheld scanner, scanning everyone to see if they have a cell phone on them. Very Shady Company they can't be trusted so they trust no one. "
bad,"I worked there for 8 months. They knew from the day I was interviewed that I have Chronic Migraines. They ended up firing me because my ""voice wasn't peppy enough"" for Verizon Wireless customer service. I had been dealing with a week long migraine and had ER visit papers to show it."
bad,"By far, this was my least favorite place to work. I began to loathe coming to work. "
bad,"They don't work with your schedule it's strictly a 8-430."
bad,the manager is very unprofessional. He never communicates with with his team on how the projects are going and how much do we need to do to finish the daily quota also forget about having any plans after work they never tell you what time are you leaving until 5 minutes before they let you go. the opportunities of advancement are non-existent. the manager lied to me i was told i would work from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. and he would make us come at 5 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. overall i would never recommend this job to anyone unless they really need the money.
bad,"Xerox will hire anyone and they usually let the good ones walk. They do not give raises for any reason. They promise advancement in the company, yet can't make up their mind on what they are going to do. I've seen people go through training to get higher in the company and that training completely come to a halt. We get promised bonuses and commissions but never receive them. Management is usually of hiding in a bathroom or their vehicle or the break room and sometimes even in the back of the empty cubicles playing in their phones, of which aren't even allowed the floor. The stress caused by the company is far worse than that of what customers for Verizon could ever put us through."
bad,"Xerox company should be ashamed to call themselves a fortune 500 billion dollar company. The Tempe office hires anyone off the street to handle their call center. Xerox motto is ""Fake til you make it"""
bad,"no benefits, no paid holiday or sick leave. Basically there's no way to go. In order to make money there you have to work over 100 hours a week."
bad,When people work for your company they should look forward to come to work the following day. Working environment should be fun and enjoyable.
bad,"Worked there for almost 4 yrs did not get no raises they only offered incentives, They did work with me on my children's schedule."
bad,"Not a very stable or secure environment.  Glued to the phones.  Lots of fear of being laid off.  Very gossipy and cliquish.  You got on the phones and you had to get permission to use the bathroom,, there was no flexibility.  Very rigid."
bad,Very unorganized and unprofessional. This job changes work flow constantly and you never know what to expect. Communication is horrible. And the hardest thing to do is to come to work without knowing if you will still have a job or not.
bad,The location in which the call center was located. formerly ACS then bought out by Xerox was shut down. I had 3 supervisors quit in two weeks for a reason.
bad,"Rude, incompetent managers. Racial bias and is an EEOC claim going somewhere to happen."
bad,"I was not impressed. Their software and systems were low key. Verifying a customer steps were unnecessary. I don't expect them to be in business very long. Not a very good company to work for. Cheap pay for cheap workers."
bad,"The best part about this place was working with my coworkers. Management team was not friendly or helpful. It's a job not a career. No retirement plan, regardless of how long you was there."
bad,"Xerox purchased a small firm I worked for and were not set up to begin work in the Corporate Learning industry in my opinion."
bad,this workplace is a great workplace if you are not planning to stay in one job site to long.. xerox is constantly hiring many people to just fire them instantly. the workplace has a lot of requirements when assisting customers and you constantly work under pressure and you walk in to work everyday not sure if it will be your last day because they may just fire you over anything. yes they simply fire you without providing a warning for any action you took not knowing right or wrong....
bad,"I worked here for a year the leadership was clueless the whole job was a joke , the job stability was horrible they laid off 350 people and recalled a month later WOW !"
bad,Everything here is negative please avoid this place you will regret it. Worked there 4 years the worst ever. The only positive is the people you work with and if your lucky you might get a good manager.
bad,"Ghetto, Trash, Nasty, Unprofessional trash supervisors, and unrealistic demands regarding scheduling. The pay caps at 14.00 and you get yelled at on a daily basis by the GM. He is very loud and obnoxious."
bad,"Do not work for this call center! Xerox may be ok but the Fort Wayne office is not a good place to work for! It is worse than being back in high school. They make it impossible for anyone to be successful, the coaches are horrible! Trust me and listen to the reviews, everything that has been said is true, it is not worth it!"
bad,Needs better leadership training and communication skills. Company overall needs more highly professional leaders and training
bad,"Xerox is horrible or maybe it's just all call center, mentally coaches, teamleads, supervisors treat you like toddlers & infants, please don't accept any offers from this company."
bad,"Good company to work for. Salary isn't the best, but still not bad. I would recommend this employer to someone looking to become a CSR. Good atmosphere"
bad,"NO RAISES, Work load of 3 people. No benefits, No job security."
bad,"No growth or compensation! I enjoy the work I do, but company cares about quantity not quality. I have nothing to say about this place, the fact that Im job searching says enough."
bad,working at Bank of America I learned a lot they took in entry level workers and didn't discriminate they company also took great care of their employees.
bad,"This is the worst job ever!!!!! The pay is garbage. They sell you false hope in training, management doesn't do their job, and the customers are straight out nasty. 10.00 an hour is not worth the stress and headache"
bad,10$ hourly they want you to do too much for so little. Expect to see real fist fights and they steal so don't bring anything personal! If you want a job really bad I suggest you work here at your own risk.
bad,I would prefer the company culture to be very team oriented and focused on delivering real measurable results while still maintaining a friendly and respectful work environment.
bad,"this company is a joke, no raises, no advancement.. revolving door there, they want there employees to fail.. they actually set you up for failure"
bad,"This company needs NEW leadership. No cellphones no books no pens allowed. BEDBUGS infestation. No advancement opportunities. Employee morale is,very low."
bad,xerox is unorganized and not advocates for their employees. Management is unprofessional. Needs new management! Pay is ok but the things you have to put up with make it not worth it.
bad,"The job was satisfactory"
bad,"Don't do it to yourself. This place will suck the soul out of you. The bathrooms are horrible. I swear pre-k students can clean up after themselves better than ""grown adults""."
bad,I called members to get there permission to send there medications in the mail. Also answer any other questions the may have about there account.
bad,"I enjoyed this job at the beginning but as time went on and management change it became a place that I hated to see everyday."
bad,"The people I worked with are amazing here, but unfortunately, the company in itself is terrible. I understand as a company, you are looking at making profits at all times, but the way they treat their employees was out of this world."
bad,"This was the worst job i have ever had. People are not friendly at all specially management. They dont take there job seriously at all they have no time to spend time with there employees if there having an issue that needs attention. Training is horrible, all the clients' plan rules have a different interpretation depending on who you talk to. So pretty much your wrong all the time. They dont care oe have any compassion for there employees. No room for growth no raises at allllllll! A family member of mine has been there 20 yrs if not more and has not gotten a raise since 2006 ish. Before it was Xerox. There just horrible i hope people read before considering a job there"
bad,"This is a terrible business to work for just because the corporate management is really pretty incompetent. Employees at the bottom level are headed in and out and not given much in the way of a paycheck. The place is dirty and not well kept for the most part. It's a disciplinarian environment where the rules reign supreme and nobody seems to care about anything else. I attempted to move up the ladder, but everybody I talked to who had already moved up strongly advised me against it so I gave up. The promotion process isn't even fair because at one point a position opened up and nobody even held interviews but instead just moved someone into it. Afterward managers did say they would hold interviews but of course that never happened."
bad,"For 10 dollars an hour you can work in a sweatshop like call center taking calls from angry customers who will pin all of their personal problems on you when in reality a lot of their dumb issues arise from being sold something without being told all of the details. If you're looking for an easy job to get, this would be it. Their hiring process is extremely unprofessional, and they will sell you no the job without giving you the same courtesy the lack the skill to give to customers. Their business model isn't to provide high end support, it's just to push problems around until someone finally gives up on trying to fix their issue. If you enjoy upselling products, selling refurbished pieces of dung, and transferring customers without actually accomplishing anything, this might be the job for you."
bad,"If you enjoy being micromanaged, manipulated, and used, this is the place to work.  Some co-workers are great.  Upper management is out of touch with reality."
bad,"I was responsible for over 500 agents, checked payroll, coached and development my 13 agents on a daily basis, take payments, escalations, read and respond to emails, attend meetings etc. I enjoyed going to work just for my 13 agents plus the 500 I helped on a daily basis, they made my work day so much better because of the love that we have for one another, just as well as making sure that the succeed as a team and individuals. The hardest part of my job is management, meaning there is lack of care for their employees, not giving recognition when credit is due. I learned that you have to treat others with respect in order to receive it and even if you treat them with respect you may never get it in return. I also love and enjoy being a supervisor, because I'm able to help others"
bad,enjoy talking to the members assisting with their insurance problems great place to fill comfortable but know promotion opportunity learned great customer service skills and how to communicate
bad,"Typical day at work come in answer calls all day.  Learn how to answer phones, Management was from Juarez Mexico with very poor attitudes. Co workers where fun. Nothing was hard. Most enjoyable was weekends off."
bad,"Not a great place to work.  They put you in a big room that looks like a warehouse with a picnic table to work off of and you share that table with one other person, so you better like each other.  There was no management, no structure to the work day.  If you were off for a holiday they would make you work over the rest of the week to make up for that holiday time off, so what was the point of the holiday????  Really terrible place to work"
bad,This is one of the worst places I've worked. Management was horrible and there was no structure. People were fired for the smallest thing. Also there is no growth unless you're popular which is not a good thing.
bad,"They do not care about their employees at all. You have to provide all your own office supplies (even a mouse pad) and they do not give out any raises!! The salary you start at is the salary you will end at. The benefits are absolutely horrible! You only get 1 plan option, expensive premium and a $2800 deductible with 20% coinsurance after. Plus they constantly do lay offs. You can see on their site that they are hiring but on the same day they will lay off 200 people. They do not give a severance, just a supplemental unemployment benefit that you get for only a couple weeks that supplements your unemployment benefits. They recently started a clean desk policy and you can not even have pictures of your loved ones on your desk. There is zero company morale and everyone looks so depressed in the office. One of my hard-working co workers that should be getting promoted, actually got a pay decrease a few weeks ago!! This is the most honest review, you can ask anyone that works there. Plus, they just recently sold the company. They will have a new name shortly. No business is coming in, just leaving. Don't work here!"
bad,The management over there are corrupt and incite to consume drugs and the supervisor and operation manager shout bad words inside of the workplace and talk about drugs normally
bad,"Absolutely the worst company I have ever worked for. "
bad,"the experince at xerox is terrible!!!!!!! the supervisors are rude and disrespectful , they have lack of knowledge, no common skills of respect, talk to workers like kids , the OM ( original manager ) has no respect, they dont know how to talk to any one , worst job ever"
bad,"Worked for QBSI and my experience was awful. This company has a higher turn over ratio which is not surprising because management is very incompetent, especially mid level managers. "
bad,"Everything that has been written about Xerox in El Paso is true. Cons:"
bad,"Worst job i've ever had. They hire anybody, the pay is low, they treat their employees awful and the schedules are not accommodating. They REALLY don't care about employees, they just need a voice on the other end of that phone. They also hover over you if you're on a call too long."
bad,"Xerox hires warm bodies. If you want to feel stimulated intellectually and emotionally, do not work for this company in any of its call centers."
bad,"The company use to be wonderful to work for, but it is slowing falling apart. It is now being split into two companies and the future is uncertain. It is a scary situation."
bad,I enjoyed working for this company. However the company relocated and without warning began to let people go. I was one of those people. No care for the workers
bad,"Ghetto , unprofessional and uneducated management , turn over rate was high because they hired anyone that passed a hearing test and managed  to type a paragraph in a minute . Canceled lunches and made us eat while working . All we got was pizza everytime they canceled . I moved to different department in the company . And they had us sharing a small desk . So no personal shape what so ever I could not ever turn around in my sit that's how close I was to the other person . All the people wanted to do was gave pot lucks ! If you want to waste time apply here"
bad,The management was 2 faced as could be. As I was not part of their clique. You were treated like school children and talked about behind your back. Very unproffesional Management.Was told by supervisor that it was workforce reduction but people with less seniority than I were kept
bad,"There is no job security and advancement is set upon favor with certain people. Retaliation is excercised often and covered with policys that are not otherwise followed. Leadership fratenizes with the agents who work on the floor, Inadequate training and unprofessional standards set by the leadership. All in all the absolute worst place I have ever worked.,"
bad,Horrible place to work. Don't waste your time. There is no work to life balance. No room for advancement. Management does not care about employees. No raises. Does not pay a living wage.
bad,"The job in itself is easy if you are a real great customer service agent, coworkers can be really great people to work with. Where this company lacks is leadership and management. The average employee is just a number easily replaced no matter how long your carrier with them has been. "
bad,This job is very stressful and demanding for the amount of paycheck it is not worth it. The coworkers are always fighting and supervisors are always high off of weed.The management was terrible and the hardest part of the job was just being there everyday all day long.
bad,"It is a very strict place with no opportunity with long hours, low pay, and poor management. I learned enough to find another job opportunity somewhere else. Management is always unorganized, they don't appreciate the employees."
bad,One day i had to work a 24 hr shift straight because they were short handed. It was very frustrating. They didnt let me go home and felt very sleep deprived.
bad,"My objective :"
bad,"This place was just horrible, they don't treat their employees well at all the most depressing place i have ever worked in my life i would never go back to this place to be honest i would rather be a stripper than work back here again"
bad,the job closed and no longer is a contractor for where I was employed. wouldn't advise anyone to apply for any position with Xerox
bad,"It is a very sad, non-motivational, and depressing place to work. Management does whatever they want and will only implement policy if it is to their convenience. Because it is peace rate and not hourly rate, they say you can make up to $15.00 an hour, when the most you can make is $12.00 an hour the first month on the floor. But then they find loop holes to bring your pay down to minimum and blame the pay decrease on not enough work coming through, or servers are down, or a project is being fixed, or the famous training where all supervisors have there own set of rules and none of them are on the same page which affect your productivity when it comes to QA. Keep in mind time is money and for every second your on downtime your rate drops so therefore you are left being subsidized and in the end making minimum. There is no room for advancement in the company or a pay increase, you are lucky if you even get to $8.00. Good luck even trying to get a ""Thank you"" or any type of acknowledgement of the effort or extra time you put in to get the job done well to meet daily quota. Because, the project manager and main supervisor were brought over from the Xerox in Mexico they run the company the same way. They have no respect for the employees and will talk down to you and if there is anyone that try's to defend themselves they will be label as combative and uncooperative. There is no HR in the building and if you need to speak to them there is a 1-800 number to call but there will be nothing done because they just let the project manager know what's going on."
bad,Please dont think about working here. This company is one of the worst places to work for. The operations manager will literally not listen to you. There have been many agents that he has laughed in there face while trying to talk to him. Have you ever wondered why they are always Hiring? The turn over rate is horrible for this place bc of the way you get treated. There is nothing worth the 10.00/hr they are offering.
bad,"Don't work here! It isnt right the way you treated! Your treated as a disposal razor. Long commute, worked hard with little notice, did everything I could to help customers rated poorly then got fired. Don't train you well."
bad,"As any call center there is very little concern about the employees, but the co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is to set at a bare work station waiting for the next call."
bad,this job cares about no one and the call volume is too high for only 10.00 an hour and they will fire you for anything and this place will hire anyone so might i add its a lot of fresh out of high school employees and boy do they act like it
bad,"this was the lowest point in my working life. Many didnt make it out of training, some left on the first day on the phones, I last 16mos. By then only myself and one other woman remained of our class of 40 people. By then I had a bald spot because of the stress. "
bad,"I worked for Xerox all of 4 months before being ""laid off"" due to reduction in workforce. They laid off a host of employees without warning and we were left two weeks to find another job. Being an at-home position communication was detrimental to having success with the job. Communication with the supervisors through chat, phone and email was very hard especially when I needed authorization for something. While I enjoyed being at home, it was definitely a tough work experience. The supervisors lack patience and do not care to acknowledge the employees."
bad,"i worked here for four months and it was horrible.  u.s. cellular was double billing the people on auto pay and we couldnt even refund their money,  only give a $50 credit.  i could't do my job well due to their rules and bad service and billing twice."
bad,"Very first job , It was okay I got the hang of things pretty quickly... I learned ALOT of new things such as .. working at a very fast pace which was so bad after all ... I had the BEST cowokers at times ... During lunch hour they where a pain in the butt but it was ALL love .. The most enjoyable part of the job was lunch hour ... having a race with drive thru and front counter to see who could get the orders out quickly and of course drive thru did because I was operating it ."
bad,All we need is raise and more professionalism. This job can drain you mentally and make you want to get another job.Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
bad,WORST JOB EVER!!!!!! this is the most ghetto unorganized place in Orlando!. They give you a 2 week training and then thrrow you on the floor to do cases that come from doctors to see if a patience gets approved for their medicine. Its brutal and its not worth the 13 dollars per hour. Everyone who trains you is rude. It's like a big gossip house. Everyone talks about each other. and the building is very nasty. Seems like it was built in 1903.....oh and also to mention benefits are terrible.....401K match is 3 percent?....where they do that at??? lol smh...apply if you want to!!
bad,The job doesn't care about their employees. There isn't any opportunity to grow. There is a lot of favoritism in the workplace.
bad,"The bosses were rude, they didn't work with you on hours, made excuse after excuse about why your schedule was the opposite of what you said you could work. Smelt funny."
bad,The pay was good but the selection of hours i was given wasn't the best. It was easy advancement they didn't have any type of good bonuses.
bad,"I loved the work that I did because I knew that my biggest, most important thing that I was doing was helping people all across the state obtain health insurance for themselves & their families. The BIGGEST problem with this company is their managenent team. They're very unprofessional, not trustworthy at all, neither are skilled & needs professional training, they want you to work like you're a robot & keeps track your every move. No one likes to work under those conditions. Management have no idea how to treat their employees, which would explain the high turnover rate. They really & truly need an HR rep on-site in order to keep it professional; the current management team pretty much makes their own decisions & wants people to abide by them.... I feel bad for the younger employees coming in, they have not a clue....You are ONLY promoted if they like you, it doesn't matter if you're a great employee. Things can change from day to day, even hour by hour. If management REALLY cared, they'd pay attention to how they're being rated & should want to make some changes...afterall, it IS their reputation that's being rated for the next potential employee to be aware of. If you want your employees happy, compensate them for the work that they do; treat them like they're actual PEOPLE & not just a number.  There's so much more to say about this company, especially the less than professional director & managers. They're one of the main reasons why most people leave. You only retain good employees wherever you have good management."
bad,I didn't enjoy going to work everyday. I wanted to expand my knowledge and learn different tasks and they just wouldn't do it. Rude customer service ever.
bad,"Management had no skills, this job was horrible.  I was a supervisor for 15 years, and I have never nor will I ever treat employees this bad.  If you don't care about yourself, and want to make 10.00 an hour while getting screamed at for what they taught you, then.this place is for you. Oh, and if it snows and you travel far for them and practically kill yourself in snow storms, DO NOT be 5 MINUTES LATE. They don't get as much snow there, so you will get points!! Horrible, I cry every time I think about the year I wasted at this place.  Its a nightmare."
bad,"The company gave you a pay check, and let you know if you was going to get one in the next two weeks. Managment stole company money."
bad,"not really an organized work environment, have a high rate turn over and can do better with upper management, don't really like the job, want something more as a career, not a company were you would want to advance and be happy with"
bad,"I have never done so much to try to help customers so much to only have that bit me in the backside. Almost had to file an age discrimination suit and probably would if I hadn't found something much better. Management is so clueless and or entirely inept to who actually cares for their customers and he brand the best. Worst money and environment I have ever worked for, I would go on food stamps before going to work there again!!!!"
bad,"It's like being in high school again and if that's the case I hope you were one of the popular kids....you will fit in."
bad,"Without going into too much detail, I'll say that I've never worked with a group of people as less helpful as my supervisors at this job.  The pay was simply not worth the aggravation."
bad,"I didn't like working for the company, terrible management, compensation was horrible. Only thing enjoyable was the potluck dinners. We were able to eat at our desk and that's it"
bad,"I loved talking to new people on the phone, just didn't like the way the system was run. no support to ask a question was like  talking to a wall. I wasn't valued, did come to work to work no problems with anyone. did my job"
bad,"Managed wide variety of customer service and administrative tasks to resolve customer issues quickly and"
bad,"All the work given is easy, the company offers no pay raises. Over time is only given out to the managers picks. I Would not suggest this company as a place of regular employment only as a supplement"
bad,I worked here its not what you want to do they say all the good things in training class but once you get to the production floor it's nothing like they said it would be. They don't want to pay for holiday pay at all when they over hire they lay off people
bad,Working for this company is a real and very hard challenge.  Xerox has been charged with the responsibility of managing public healthcare in this state.  They have taken current employees and converted them over as Xerox employees.  Their positions and those of incoming individuals were poorly formed and training is seriously lacking/inadequate.  I would not recommend employment with this company unless you are just desparate for a place to work.  The work is hard and confusing and changes frequently.
bad,"I'm grateful for the opportunity but there is no room to grow here. No real benefits, no incentives, but I loved the hours."
bad,"The constantly changing pay structure can only be described as haphazard. I was mortified to see the 'benefits package'. It is not a health plan, it is a way to get $1300 in debt plan. Overall, not managed well, no concern for employee satisfaction whatsoever. I would be accepting of the IT issues at a company half this size and not in the technology industry, but their IT management is atrocious, and its your problem to fix the issues. In short, don't work here."
bad,The job was not a good place to work Whenever you needed assistance form a supervisor they where never there. The company did not care about there employees they only cared about themselves. Worst company I have every work for.
bad,They hire anyone that speaks the language.  The management kept having private meetings that looked like parties.  I was never recognized.  The schedule changed too much. The facility had bugs literally . The reps were penalized more than coached. People were doing whatever they wanted.  There was no fun at all.
bad,"Was a long and boring three weeks of training...I had a training with 22 people only 8left and the 8 left will quit soon.We were told n sign an agreement of $9.50 of training and $10 after training. Training is done two weeks ago and we still getting paid $9.50.  Mean supervisor and rude, when a customer ask for supervisor she will nt take the call n give u an attitude, u can't even ask her so nothing. Some customers are mean they yell at you like u r their children, I dnt blame them for yelling because xerox ripe them off and the agent hv to face the consequences. SAD. Short breaks and they change yr schedule without giving u a notice."
bad,"I have never worked in a place that was more intent on the harassment and attempted theft from the employees."
bad,"I would file appeals, answer questions about transactions, go over the customers funds on their debit cards. The pay scale depending on the quality of your work, which was not ideal."
bad,"Xerox ITO is now owned by ATOS. Do not assume they care two tweets about you. Upper management is only concerned about themselves and their bonuses. Unless you are applying for an upper management job, do not work here."
bad,Very difficult to have an outside life with this company. REQUIRES overtime even everyday as needed. Leads ARE NOT helpful in any sense. job culture was terrible! all in all a terrifying experience!
bad,This is honestly not a good place to work at all i had to quit they would not even try to help me with my schedule. everything just sucked the get you to come with the offer of all the over time you want and the money but they dont tell you the that 10 of the over time hours are required you have top do it or get in trouble. If you work here you will basically have to tell your home life goodbye.
bad,"The management needs more training before taking other companies contracts."
bad,"Management was terrible, employees are terrible, hateful and rude, and the Verizon people seem to do what they want on the floor just because its their contract. A typical day at work was hearing people (who are not supposed to use bad language, be allowed food, beverages or electronic cigarettes on the premises) using foul language that ruins the good mood required to make it in this notorious call center job, eating food at their desks, drinking drinks from any number of fast food proprietors, and smoking their electronic cigarettes at their desk. The management had a tendency to tell people not to do these things, but would turn around and do these same things themselves. I learned to never work here again, and that people will always be able to find a way around the rules in their favor. The only enjoyable part of this job was the training classes, which gave potential employees the illusion of grandeur that is completely contradictory to how this company actually functions. Also, they tend to schedule last minute ""mandatory overtime,"" which for any human being who knows the labor laws, knows that overtime is at not only employers' discretion, but at employees' discretion as well. They do not care about people's outside problems, even parents with children in daycare, or pregnant women, they only care about their mission to take as much money from the customer base and not return it. If you expect to work here, expect to be told no a lot when trying to give customers their money back, even when its the company's fault."
bad,"It is poorly managed, and very non-supportive work environment. I have learned that members have a rough time with insurance companies and that cronyism is still alive. The management is very poor and degrading to employees."
bad,"Quality assurance, assist agents on calls, supervisor calls, no job security, upper management does not value its employees"
bad,"worked there almost 5 years. Treated us horrible, like children. Monitoring when we go to the bathroom and having their little pets(aka coaches) walking up and down the aisles making sure we don't talk. We're adults but we weren't treated like adults. Inconsistent pay"
bad,this company does not work well with the employees. I had surgery and had to resign when they refused to give me enough leave to fully recover from my surgery
bad,"You get promises of advancement, pay raises and all you get is belittled by management NONSTOP. Mandatory overtime, more work on top of more work, no more pay, no perks, no incentive, management doest support or stand up for their staff to the client. Demeaning and oppressive atmosphere and I met employess in other states who experienced the exact same thing. CANDIDATE BEWARE!!"
bad,"This is by far the worst job that I have ever had. The angry customers aren't really the problem, it is the management style. "
bad,"I worked at the call center, Colorado Springs, CO,  in 2012."
bad,"no annual increase, ot scheduled without notice, hours changed without notice, supervisors change faster than the weather, additional steps added to process without any changes in pay, and they want you ready to work at your start time without any time to set up the system so you have to get the screens up before your start time or else you get points for being late."
bad,"This is the only company that I have worked for where they micromanage all the time.  They will walk around with a cell phone scanner and if it picks up that your phone is on they will walk you out the door.  They will clock you out if you go to the bathroom outside of your break time, and then ask where you been when you return."
bad,I did not like the job or hours. the worst work experience I have ever had. I did no like the job...... he place was very unprofessional and dirty
bad,the management of this company will not work with the employees in any form concerning medical accommodations. the employment opportunity's are there but the training is very stringent and strict. there is no room for trying different avenues to get the job done.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of logging into your e-mail, opening necessary applications to fulfill the day's work load, policy change, and disrespect from management and co-workers. Management is completely irrational and inexperienced. The appointed operations manager is young and has no idea how to operate in a professional setting. Favoritism towards her friends and those who are genuinely trying to make a honest living- she can careless about. Promotions are given to those who are friendly with her and Work force has no direction. Requested days off are granted to their friends. Any changes in schedule will have to be specifically indicated due to a medical concern with proper documentation. This company does NOT honor college students. The co workers are extremely unprofessional and rude. I do not recommend this job to anyone seeking a career for the long haul. Several complaints have been filed through human resources and unfortunately nothing is being done. When the client comes to visit management tries to paint this picture that the employee's are crazy and quitting for no reason. Several NCNS and job abandonment. This is a disgusting company to work for."
bad,"This place is unprofessional,  the bathrooms are filthy. Management sucks. They only care about their numbers. They want us to be robotic on the phones..  if every little thing we say on the phone is not up to par they write us up. We have pto but we can't use them if we don't want to get a point. I can't stand these rude snotty verizon customers they have no respect!!! Once again this job sucks"
bad,"Management thinks they are Gods, they walk past you without speaking, spend most of their day gossiping or online shopping. You are paid a specific rate for everything that you do but if you're good at something and make what they consider to be too much, they lower the rate or give the work to temps so that no one makes that rate. They assign ""special projects"" at a rate, lower than it's actual value to keep you from making too much also.  They make the job much harder than it is and they will give you lateral promotions, no more money, just titles. Very clique-ish place to work."
bad,"Xerox is a great start for a person that's never worked in a call center.  The only good thing about Xerox are the my co-workers.  The pay is terrible, they changed my schedule without notice, I have switch job titles several times.  It's awful!"
bad,"Worst place with the worst management possible. Where do I begin? Lets start at the bed bugs...yes bed bugs. Instead of securing the building and letting everyone go home the minute they found out they continued to let employees work which only spread it turning one case into 8 then they finally decided to get someone in to spray the building.Next they swear that they can work with you and are flexible but the moment you really need a shift change it can't be done. And shift bids forget about it no such thing so your pretty stuck depending on who your om is. Work environment disgusting  from the bathrooms to the equipment just disgusting. The refrigerators in the break rooms most horrible thing you will ever smell."
bad,"The review about  Xerox,  unpleasant!  The only benefit gained was working in a high demand call center. Extreme unprofessionalism!  Hostile work environment!"
bad,Good for On Roll Employees but what about Off Roll Employees?. Realy in Mumbai situation is worst like volcano. Some people are making it more than worst.
bad,I enjoyed working with friends but Xerox could work on their management skills. It was fun talking to 50-60 random Verizon customers a day.
bad,"Could not take working there. Supervisor were rude and yelled at you while on the phone with customers, or they would pull you in the middle of the floor and yell at you over something you had no control over. Training was not worth even going to. Never knew the truth about the product because it was always changing. Customers would call in and inform me of new promotions and most of the time they were not provide to us. Management didn't even have answers for you and would make you stand there for 20 to 30 min to get help and then get upset on your handle time."
bad,"they are very unorganized they treat the reps as if they work means nothing and applaud the managers for the reps work while he reps get talked down to and treated like garbage when they do all the work .you work 10 hr shifts  with 30 minute and lunch and only three 10 minute breaks"
bad,"Pharmacy Help desk"
bad,The compensation of this employer is very poor  if your trying to build a career; it gives you false hope to obtain a goal. $10 hourly isn't great compensation for a someone  living in these inflationary times
bad,Very little support from team leads or management. constantly being yelled at by angry customers.  Always short staffed
bad,The management is not the best they don't care about you or anyone else for that matter you can get fired for anything even if you did your job correctly the building is not very clean and very well taken care of the systems do not work very well and there is not enough room for all the agents there trying to hire and advancement is the hardest thing to get with the company
bad,"The work was intense, very busy and I enjoyed working there. I was able to operate 3 to 4 high speed printers and also send packages to outgoing locations, which had to be labeled and sent to the appropriate location."
bad,"Working with this company is not very gratifying, if an individual just wants call center experience and to make a little bit of change this would be okay provided your not attempting to support yourself and have no plans of doing anything else in life. The company doesn't give raises and they feel any move (if available unless you become a Supervisor) is a transitional move."
bad,I was lied to from the beginning. Relocated my life with a promise of different position within Xerox.....moved and the position was not what I was told it would be. Horrible to employees. Bullies.
bad,I worked there for 3 wks. the training sucked. it was all games and nothing to learn on the computer. the girl I sat next to in class was an ahole. I walked out. I drove for an hr to get there for 10.00 hr. not worth it and they lie to you about everything.
bad,Good Job Placement for college students who are still trying to afford living on there own while getting degree. Very easy job and stressful.
bad,"Typical day consists of clocking in loading up programs and assisting customers who call in. I learned how to Process customers requests either placing orders, canceling orders, or giving information based on their status. Management was very unethical where they would put people into positions that they didn't apply for or want. Where they give positions agents want and applied for to someone else. Co-workers are great to work. Hardest part of the job was making sure you assist the customer and find the main reason they called in. When I was a supervisor I loved having the team and we made the job a lot more enjoyable and I was able to make sure people who excelled were looked at by the higher management for possible promotions into positions they were interested in."
bad,"VERY UNPROFESSIONAL AND UNORGANIZED. ""BOLINGBROOK AREA "" I've worked for xerox for about 6 months and that was the worst 6 months ever. I worked for the Verizon side they changed peoples schedule within a few days of the new start and i asked the high manager to see if there was anything they could do due to the fact i have a child and they told me that ""They don't work around child care needs and I need to show up on that Saturday for work."" word for word. I was in complete disgust ! They treat their workers like slaves, you can't get up to go to the bat room without getting pointed. When I first started they didn't even have a supervisor to lead our pod."
bad,"I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy. They have forgotten why they do the business that they do. They treat employees as replaceable and no retention of good quality individuals. People are used and abused and then let go, when not accommodating to their needs any longer."
bad,"This company has no foresight.  Every day I find old duck tape that is peeling off and am instructed to apply a fresh patch."
bad,"Work Place is less than desirable. Cubicle space changes daily and are always nasty. "
bad,"The line of business was new, and the start up did not run smooth at all. I don't feel like I was prepared with the necessary training for the job."
bad,"I learned that a professional attitude and a positive outlook on life can get you far in the work place, mostly that starts with the mindset of the individual. If the initial foundation of the company your working for does not have those qualities its going to be hard for you as an employee to have a positive influence. As an employee, even if the environment is not suitable you are to remain professional at all times because you never know who's life you may influence on an average day."
bad,"A typical day consisted of talking to about 30 customers via telephone. The phone calls themselves weren't bad at all. It was the supervisor that I had that made it miserable, and was a huge factor in why I left. I did however learn many new things about different software and systems, how to properly handle upset customers, etc. My co-workers were amazing. They were always so willing to help, and some became close friends. The hardest part of working at Xerox would have to be the way I was treated by my supervisor. I could never do anything right, I was ""bad at my job,"" and I was constantly talked down to, and like I was an idiot. On the bright side, the most enjoyable part was being able to make friends. The employees were amazing and accepting."
bad,Its a work from home job and they have split shift schedules. You cannot have a balanced life with the hours given. They do provide the equipment but you have to find the right internet and phone line out your expenses.
bad,Xerox is Cadillac-type product whose price point is NOT  justified based on their quality. Color products produce superior quality. High end products deliver unprecedented reliability/uptime.
bad,Xerox in Raleigh don't care about YOU period. They tell you that indirectly and directly sometime depends on who you ask.When they came up with the rule that they NO LONGER ACCEPT DOCTORS NOTES. That's basically saying we don't care if your dieing you better have your spirit come answer the phone for you. But out of all fun and joke there is NO job security at that place. the management team don't even know the material. they basically are just trying a thing like a scientist in a lab with lab rats.
bad,Typical day is your stuck to your chair with hardly any leeway time 1 fifteen minute break and a thirty minute lunch and your watched very badly if your not liked
bad,Its the worse place to work for. No opportunity to advance to make or learn new skills . the worse experience with working with this company
bad,"Everything was great about this company."
bad,Xerox not a good company to work for. Company don't care if your kids in hospital or yourself. Stressful job that don't pay anything.
bad,"The work itself is decent. However, management is disorganized and the work culture is awkward and unprofessional. They claimed the hours were from 6am to 3pm, but after being hired they said it was from 5am to 3pm. The facility could use some upkeep."
bad,"At the Bolingbrook location, it is very unstructured, and very unstable. They lack the leadership skills and only focus on placing bodies in seats. The work itself is manageable there training does provide you with necessary skills to perform your job."
bad,Xerox is the worst place I have ever worked in my life!!!! The management is ridiculous and the training horrible.  Everything you are told in training is a lie!!! There is no support and you get yelled at by customers and swore at!! Your pay is determined by Verizon customers so if they are unhappy with their bill or couldnt talk you into giving them free services or phones they can affect your pay
bad,Contract work for 10.50 hr.  Not worth the headache to deal with unhappy bank customers who scream and yell because they've overdrawn their accounts.  This base of customers you deal with are the absolutely unhappy.  Don't dare work overtime for an incentive. ...The company does not make good on (gift cards) promised.  Xerox is supposed to be this big company but it is nothing like a big company offering low wages to deal with all the mess you train to know and do.  Oh yeah benefits are not good at all too.
bad,Xerox is a great company to work for. The training I received gave me the capabilities to do my job efficiently. Each work day ended as fast as it came.
bad,"I am not doing this because I want to.  It was a job when I needed a job.  It helped me put food on the table and roof over my children's heads.  I didn't care for the place, but again it was money"
bad,staying busy helping customers and learning new things each day . enteracting with coworkers making new friends .i get my own space to myself
bad,"The company is so up tight , if your late 1 minute you docked for a 30 minutes of your pay. If there is a emergency and you need to you your phone or is seen with your phone in your hand leaving the floor , you will be written up or termed it depend on which manager see you. They do not care for you or your family."
bad,"saai werk wat niet mij ding is geweest in het verleden."
bad,"The work is demanding but that's ok. The problem is the management. The rules change all the time--four times in one day once--and you are expected to know about each change even if no one has told you. You can be fired for just about anything. The only discipline they have is firing--no fines, no suspensions. You broke a rule so you're fired--even if you didn't know about the rule. "
bad,"This is call center operation. They expect the world of its employees while at the same time treating them with little respect and encouragement. Unfortunately, its the company culture and the only one to blame is the top management. It has a 1950 sweat shop mentality."
bad,"Worked as a Customer Service Rep at the Colorado location and it is beyond a waste of time other than a temporary job. Growth is nonexistent unless you happen to be close with the management, I've seen other reps on my team put on hold for advancement solely because our supervisor didn't like them too much. Training is a joke and hardly prepares you for actually taking calls and the equipment is a joke. The software to work with customer accounts crashes several times a day without fail, the computers are beyond slow and inhibit your ability to efficiently get the tasks done. If you get sick often or have kids, don't bother. Even though they have hundreds of reps working, a day missed here or there puts you up for termination. Breaks are a joke, you can't hardly run to the cafeteria and grab breakfast or a snack and be back on time. They don't care about your personal performance whatsoever. Surveys as how the customer feels about the company and the rep they worked with. If they rate the company anything lower than a 9 out of 10, the survey is failed regardless of how they rated you personally, and you have to get coached on the call as if it was your fault the products and services are priced too high or the company has shafted the customer before."
bad,"Company environment is not very professional. No benefits and no incentives. Management has its pros and cons, but not a good place to work for."
bad,there were very last minute and always changing things without a heads up. overall I enjoyed my team members that I was in training class and my supervisor was great
bad,"My first impression upon entering training in this place is it is extremely dirty. All of the chairs are stained, the tables they use as desks aren't even level, the floor is disgusting. My training class addressed this with the GM of the location and she said the training rooms aren't cleaned until they're very bad. I didn't know having garbage, candy, plastic forks, bottle caps all over the floor was considered a clean environment. We also brought up to her that the chairs in the lunch room were filthy and she said she didn't know that because she never goes in there. By the way it's been 3 weeks and nothing has been cleaned. She didn't seem to phased by what we said anyway.  Never you mind the bed bug issue, shared desks (you can't have personal affects up) and shared headsets. I am completely shocked that xerox has their name on this dump. I have also found out that there are zero raises here. Needless to say I am looking for a new job... I wonder if they care why there is such a high turnover rate here. If you are a professional I would suggest looking elsewhere, this place is only good for first time job seekers or someone who is desperate for a job.."
bad,"Hires temp employees with promise of 2-3 months to hire and pay raise, keeps all employees as temp over 1 year.  Runs a government call center, but operates to make a profit, not caring about employees. Don't get comfortable in your desk, you'll be moved often, and if you're late, someone else sits at your desk contaminating it with germs."
bad,Call center environment taking front line calls. Very unprofessional as a company. End contracts with no warnings. Typical day is sitting at a desk taking front line calls.
bad,"ABC pay sucks and when you have abc rates if you make an error they charge you for those errors and your pay goes down. When this started they promised us a big pay check and when we started making the money they found any way they could to take that money away. "
bad,The day would be difficult and very unorganized. I would be struggling to walk in there everyday. The company is unorganized and the way they do business is not appropriate. I couldn't deal with the mistreatment and the disrespect from authorities so that's why I left.
bad,Very negative work environment.  Low salaries and declining benefits. Constant lay offs and pay cuts.  Little chance for advancement or pay increase.
bad,"major micro managers, they treat their employee's like high school children, they issue a company car but charge the employee 300 per month for the lease payment. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy"
bad,"This place is all about policy and does not really care about their employees. When people are sick, even with a doctors note, they get wrote up and usually end up getting fired."
bad,"I enjoy interacting with most of my co-workers and my supervisor, even though there is little time for this as there are many, many incoming calls every day and not enough people trained in all levels to handle them.  Clients often complain about the long wait times to get to a customer service agent and that their issues are not resolved in a timely manner.   There is a very high personnel turnover, the emphasis on meeting requirements for quality control seems to make that more important than the client calling, there is usually no way to actually talk to a person in a another department.  I feel the company could benefit from welcoming input from their employees to identify and resolve issues that interfere with customer service."
bad,"Runnnn do not apply here. However, depending on your title abd location I guess its not too bad. All tthis company care about are numbers. Management has no experience and creates an atmosphere of unprofessional disaster within the workplace."
bad,"This company should be shut down. I feel sorry for VZ customers having to talk to all these idiots! Management are ran but kids fresh out of high school upper management act like ""Agents"" issues are none of there concern. If you like to work for a high turn over rate job ran by punk high school kids this is the perfect place."
bad,"After transfer to outsource company (Xerox) they proceeded to cut 75% of department, only one salary raise in 9 years, moral very low, forced to move out of State for better career."
bad,"The coldstone creamery's in Tallahassee, Fl, has horrible management and that is a set up for failure in itself."
bad,Took phone calls and assistanced members best way possible had to use all resources to fully serve each person that contacted department. Schedules were subject to change every 3 months and you had the option to switch. The job is 24hrs it never closes which can be a plus and a negative at times. This could be a great long term oppourtunity for the right person.
bad,"I enjoyed working from home, but the base pay was minimal, and the projected bonus pay was unrealistic. The computer software (Apple) was constantly experiencing issues."
bad,Not a very good company to work for. I have learned beneficial skills to help contribute to my success with customer service. I believe that the company would be a lot better if it offered more support to its employees.
bad,"I worked there for almost 5 years which is accent due to their high turn over and I have never worked in an environment setting as this. Equipment was always broken. So much favoritism that employees would be afraid to speak up and if you did, you'd be sure that your job was at risk. They care more about hitting numbers and are easy to get rid of someone then putting in a little bit of effort to keep a good agent. The place is very dirty. I would only recommend this job if you are desperate."
bad,"The worst unorganized, most unprofessional company you could EVER work for. There were moments I didn't think I would even get a paycheck they were so unorganized. We never got paid on the week we were supposed to. If you ever considering working for this job, it better be your LAST resort."
bad,"go in for a paycheck then leave. basic call center good starter job. need to be able to type . Go in take calls, do team meetings og home"
bad,"this place is the worst, dont waste your ime the people here are total meanies"
bad,"Unless you have nothing to do with your life.  Don't do it. This is the worst place I have ever worked for in my life. Unorganized.  Poor pay. Unprofessional. Training was a joke. Sometimes I wasn't sure if I had come to work or showed up at a hair weaving, eyelashes night club contest. There aren't enough synonyms for the word horrible to express my true feelings about this place.  Just know you were warned. And no I am not an angry employee. If I could have rated this place a 0 star I would have. 1 star is too much."
bad,"The pay here was based on how many calls you took.. not on a rate of pay based on hours. That made this job very hard to determine what your paycheck would be at the end of the month. Some calls could last you 5 minutes, some calls can last you an hour.. based on the customer needs and most times you have no control over it, especially if the customers issue is a difficult one to resolve.. or you needed supervisor assistance.. after training, you're pretty much on your own.. there will be no one to answer additional question no matter how much you request it, call supervisor desks to receive an answer or you raise your hand for assistance there will never be anyone there to help you."
bad,"I worked here for a year and a couple of months, During this time there were numerous bomb threats, Bedbug infestations, and fires."
bad,"Don't waste your time. Go to or Comcast or Progressive, Terrible hours, will promise holiday pay you will never get. Payroll always screwed up. Harassment and discrimination very common in the workplace. You will not advance in the company as it is a quid pro quo style management. Pay sucks no annual pay reviews. Will not approve any requested time off. If you are sick forget you get points against you for taking off. You will be penalized for taking kids to doctor appointments. They will shave hours off your check. There is nothing good about this company..."
bad,"I don't advice anyone to work there. Their expectations are way to high for the amount of pay. They never give you a raise and may  cheat you. The management is poor. Constant threat of terminating your employment for small things or things that are not your fault. They expect you to work as fast as you can and never, never make a mistake. They treat you like you work in a factory without factory pay, or may be worse than factory work. They show no appreciation for anything you do well, but you will receive a lot of criticism for one small mistake, whether  its yours or not. The hours are terrible, as you have no set hours to get off, therefore if you need to work a second job, it is impossible because you may need to spend 12 hours a day there to finish the work. They  may send you home early some days and you have no overtime, which makes working long hours useless. You never know what your paycheck will be or can depend on it, as you may have a lot of hours or a lot less . They are too strict of an environment to work in. They show too much favoritism. If I had read some employee reviews I would never went there. It is not a secure job."
bad,a inbound call center for Verizon wireless. They treat their employees like garbage and pay as little as possible. I started as a agent on the floor and I was promoted within about 3 months on the floor and was thrown on a senior agent position and then was promoted about a month later. They don't treat their employees right and the pay is always sooooooo low and the managers are bias like crazy
bad,"I would never recommend this job to anyone. this place is the worst."
bad,Very unprofessional management makes difference in employees. Not a nice place to work. If you are looking for job security please do not go there.
bad,"Previously known as ACS. The management is all corrupt meaning they all best friends/sleeping with each other.  Managers who are poorly trained, and lack the enthusiasm to show up for work or even help their team when they are there. And will talk about you behind and in front of you, will talk to your crazy. Professionalism has never been taken into consideration. Very Ghetto. Im black and even for me ACS is to much. The pay is structured for you to be making the minimum $9, no matter how hard you try. We work as Sprint agents, so if you cant turn a customers service back on due to them not paying for 3mnths no matter how nicely put or customer service you provided when they get that servery and are asked was your problem solved you get a no. their goes your bonus. I would get no's on perfect calls and when I would review them with my manager, they would say oh well sorry no way we can dispute this so you dont lose your bonus for the month. It came to a point that I cave up on any type of bonus, and settled for the $9 until i Found a new job. I was constantly getting into it with my Manger due tot to fact that he wanted us to only her Yes's on surveys but wouldnt due his job for us to do so IE sign off on account credits or take supervisor calls. so no I wouldnt suggest anybody working for ACS unless they are in dyer need of a job and to just be aware that acs is always hiring because they are ALWAYS looking to fire. if you are hitting goal and getting a bonus every month they are looking for you to mess up simply because they can always hire somebody new who is going to take"
bad,Poor initial training - no opportunity to advance - long hours and no incentive pay for trainers
bad,they will mis-pay you and not have any concern at all they react as if a messed up check is the normal. recommend for kids 24 and under
bad,"A typical day at work consist of getting on the phones in a small cubical taking phone call after phone call, handling high rate customers, and When you need help you raise your hand but nobody comes to help you, all the sups are to busy flirting, hugging and talking to each other and were a burden if we have a question, The sups dont take escalation calls at all and there is no support. We have goals were suppose to reach to get bonus due to there is no raises, but they never give you the bonus if you met it. The management SUCKS!!! The bonus are a JOKE!!!! They dont invest in you at all... NEVER WORKING HERE AGAIN IF YOU PAID ME A MILLION DOLLARS!!"
bad,"Terrible management; uses favoritism, splitting people, harrassment."
bad,A typical day is answering inbound calls and enrolling callers into the affordable care act. Or answering any questions that they had about their tax credit and their annual income.
bad,This is probably the most unprofessional call center I have every worked at in my life! Management is young and uneducated ! One of the supovisers got into a fight with a agent ! Smelly bathrooms! Canceled lunch for call volume! Never heard of that in my life ! Very messy people at the work place ! Had to share a small cubical with a person ! Two people can not fit comfortably in that small space ! Small break room! Just ghetto ! If they ask you to go to customer relations DONT do it stay in md or extra care !!
bad,Xerox was a terrible first job. You were a number and got treated that way. You barely had time for breaks and your lunches were almost always cut short. I learned a little bit of customer service at this job but i wouldn't recommend it for anyone.
bad,"Sweat shop, no benefits to speak of, Management is in reactive mode"
bad,"Xerox employees are great.  What Xerox lacks, is the stability of growth and the personal identity of what it does to its employees, overworking them 12-15 hours.  Continually furloughing employees or laying off and then rehiring offshore replacements is not a good means of a stable company."
bad,"Extremely relaxed atmosphere, extremely fast paced training that leaves your head spinning & only a hand full of people that seem to really know what's going on & management does not seem to care. Hardest part of the job was trying to hear due to faulty headsets & very loud environment, the best part of the job was that there are some very special and unique individuals that work there that I was very glad I met..."
bad,Listen DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!! This job is for the sprint call center ! Your schedule is NEVER set you sign up for a mandatory shift bid and you don't get the schedule you sign up for ! Typical schedule is from 2-11 on weekends also! The company don't care bout you supervisors do nothing but eat and walk around gossiping all day! Sprint customers call and complain to the reps because sprints coverage sucks and all they care about is making money ! Not to mention the $10.00 a hour they pay you to work on weekends and holidays listening to customers complain and cuss all day ! And mandatory overtime so don't make any plans period.please don't apply here I was at the call center in charlotte and the supervisors / managers are the worst ! They don't care bout there employees the job turnover rate is high for a reason !
bad,"na, information already entered. The job sucked . The service is terrible. The job isn't hard but it is more of the people you deal with."
bad,This place is terrible at management. If only corporate knew what went on in the work place.
bad,"In the beginning it was a great place to work, since some of the upper  management left the few that stayed have created a very poor work environment and the new SBU has done the same by bringing their friends in (no experience) and putting them in positions that others deserve.  Also not consistent with processes.  They have great agents/supervisors in place and it could be a very successful business but for the leadership."
bad,"I worked at Xerox three times. Each time it was worse. This last time they hired me as an hourly employee, then after not getting paid for six weeks, my boss told me the only way to get paid was to go to salary! Since it was the week before Christmas I said yes and agreed. That was before I realized they required me to be available from 5am to 8PM and argue with everyone about what my job was or wasn't! I'm the kind of person who wants to help out. My manager told me not to help anyone.... My manager asked me what infrastructure was!?!? I made it almost two years because I was at home this time. Bad environment, bad management, dishonest to the customer, the place is a security nightmare! Hope this helps."
bad,"xerox has very bad business. they always choose their favorite people to work with and the rest your on your own. their unorganized. the young supervisors talk to the older workers that's older then them like children. they have no respect for you. they talk to you rude. most of the time, the supervisors are not around so your forced to work on your own, even when you need help. they play around a lot when you should take your job serious. i do not have an enjoyable part of the job, except for when its time to leave."
bad,"This is the most depressing place I have ever worked. Management doesn't care about employees at all. No training, cut throat place to work"
bad,TERRIBLE company to work for. Hire anyone managaement is terrible and so are empolyees. too little pay for loads of work.
bad,Worst job ever. No respectable person should spend any consideration on this company or ever think of staying beyond training. Take the $ and run!!!
bad,great place to work for first time job seekers or for college students or maybe for extra income
bad,"Limited potential for advancement"
bad,"I would never work for xerox. They make promises they cant keep. They lead you on and pretend like change is happening and its not. They take advantage of people that are loyal. They are selfish horrible company to work for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Management??? Ha ha ha thats pretty much a joke. Theres no such thing as management. They dick around and do whatever they want. I worked in eagan at xerox, the job is posted, I'm fairly warning everyone if you work there, you will get screwed over. Plain and simple."
bad,"I learned raw 834 files, how to order ID cards, and prepare reports"
bad,"I am asking you to look at my remarks for the review I did on ACS ACS is Xerox...I worked for them two different times.  My first experience with Live Bridge/ACS was ok.  I did billing for VZW and also Voice Wing Projects.  My managers at that time were good, we had a good management team.  Co-works were good, hardest part of job was dealing with irrate customers.  The most enjoyable part was working on the Transition Review Team and Voice Wing Projects. When I came back to Xerox in 11/2011 the company changed.  It was ok the first year, but they changed how we got paid.  Instead of 2.00 per call with base of 9.00 hr, it was raised to 10.00 an hour but the calls dropped to .60 cents per call/.30 cents per call and .15 cents per call.  They added surveys...You get paid .60 cents a call if you have positive surveys...If you get a failed survey they drop you to .30 cents per call and if another failed survey you get .15 cents a call after 3 you don't get any extra per call.  These failed surveys don't drop off unless you get 30 positive surveys.  So your income is based on a customer giving you a good survey.  Majority of the time, the customer is upset with a policy and so we get judged not necessarily and how well we did with the customer but rather because they are not happy with a policy or procedure."
bad,"management changed a lot."
bad,"Casi pierdo a mi bebe, a causa del estres laboral. Tenia una jefe terrible."
bad,Just don't apply save yourself the misery!! I cant believe I had to do a 9 month bid in that place....
bad,There is no Job Security Xerox is constantly hiring people therefore they are also always firing or laying off current employees. I was looking into advancing then they fired me. The employees and customers where the only part I could look forward too everyday.
bad,"Not enough pay for what is asked for, Horrible management, terrible supervisors, outlandish expectations and horrible pay. Too much favoritism!!! Promised so much yet laid off very soon. lack of work. changed departments many times due to supervisors not knowing what they were doing. Lied to MANY times."
bad,"This company that I was employeed with for almost a year and half was the hardest most displeasing company I have ever had. Dealing with the customers on a daily bases was not the hard part, it was the management. They only looked out for themselves and not the company as a whole. They look great on paper, but you can expect something completely different when you walk through those front doors. The job security was non exisitant, you had more disgruntle employees than happy ones, the policies were never consistant. They did not inform you when they changed the policies; they let you know less than a weeks notice before they changed your schedules, managers, or the location of your desks. The best part of the job was the satifaction of helping the customers."
bad,"where do I begin.... Forced Over time.(ya I know) mandatory 10 hours per 2 weeks.  reps written up without even being informed of it, supervisors forge signatures. In all honesty, I'm surprised they haven't been federally indited for all the labor laws and payroll laws they break on a day to day basis. there commission structure though sounds appealing, is set up to fail. Even if you some how become the top 10, you wont get recognized or compensated. what you'll get instead is a yell from the ""pit boss"" to get back on the phones, because if you don't, you'll get pointed and if you get to many points then you can get termed, and the only way to get points off, is to do guess what? more overtime! its a system that is built to exploit the desperate and demand the job performance of a company who pays there direct employees 14.00 start while at xerox doing the exact same work through intimidation and exploitation can get it done some what efficiently by paying only 9.00 ph. looking back at it, i'm not sure why i stayed so long, I guess because i have a family to take care of and they forced me to sign a non compete form stating i cant work for our client directly until 6 months of no longer working for xerox."
bad,Management was unethical. We were asked to do things we should not have because I believe in the customer first. They were not customer oriented.
bad,"Constant pay freezes, people not doing their job. Management structure constantly changing due to them being terminated for various inappropriate actions."
bad,"I am a former employee. The culture of the company is horrific. They require mandatory overtime. The management, especially in the Operations level are kids that micro manage, treat you without respect and honestly are not good at their job. If you are looking to work in a call center, there are many others that are MUCH better."
bad,"This was by far the worse place I have ever worked. I didn't expect call center work to be very glamorous to begin with, but management and company policies were absolutely horrible. No tolerance policies were allowed to be broken by supervisors and managers. You were expected to be treated like absolute crud and not have any rights to stand up for yourself. They do not care about their employees at all."
bad,"You do not want to work for this company! My interview and everyone else's was a LIE...they told us we would be making 15.00 hour plus, that's a lie, one day you will make 13.00 an hour, the next you will be maiking 4.00 so they can just pay you what they have to...MINIMUM WAGE...this is the worst mistake I have ever made in my career history...the Management cannot and will not answer any questions regarding the pay range...they treat you like a slave!!"
bad,"I guess AT&T spoiled me because I wasn't happy working for this company.  I enjoyed  my co-workers and the customers, but that's about it.  I did learn that it don't matter what you do, there is just some people that don't like you.  That's very hard for me because I am a people pleaser."
bad,"No career path.  You can be promoted and then sent back to an agent position for no reason at all.  Promotions are based on who you know and not what you know, how well you perform or your perfect attendance."
bad,"Worst place to work. Pay is never correct, management is unprofessional and liars."

bad,"Unorganized managers and supervisors, high school drama, new rules and requirements everyday and you wouldn't even know about it."
bad,"It's a job but get ready for being treated like you don't matter. Management is horrible, Boss burps, passes gas and is an ignorant pig. Employees quit as fast as they hire  more....and the pay is just above min... You would think working for xerox would be a good job... Not in Frostburg MD"
bad,Horrible micromanaging management and disgusting facilities.  What a nightmare and low class  company.  So happy to be away from the worst company I ever worked for.  So many layers of incompetent management it's hard to believe.
bad,One of the worst place's I have ever worked for the equipment is all broken. The supervisors are all friends of the higher up people so it does not matter how much or how hard you work or how well you do. One guy got supervisor above way more qualified people while he was on a final written notice because his friend was a Operations Manager.  Its like high school so if you are a kiss but type person this would be the job for you.
bad,the job wasn't hard itself the systems were very easy to learn. the supervisors had favoritism and they were very unorganized and extremely unprofessional.
bad,"Run Fast, Run Hard,Run Far Far Far.... DON'T look back!"
bad,This a horrible place to work. Leadership is incompetent and abusive
bad,If you are looking for short term work that really doesn't pay the bills then you have come to the right company. It is difficult to find the pro's that I had from this place except for the training staff who seemed to be interesting and helpful. Management was based on nepotism rather than ability. Pay was based on customer surveys and calculated to make sure that you will make around 10 and hour if you do really well.
bad,"Xerox was the worst place I have ever been employed. I will not recommend anybody to work there. Thank God I got hired somewhere else. Being a CCR was not so bad, but the environment, managers, and others that worked there were terrible and cruel. Please whatever you do... THINK BEFORE YOU APPLY FOR THIS TERRIBLE JOB!"
bad,"Extremely lire managers"
bad,"I did not like this job. The company is not organized."
bad,"Did not like this job at all and the pay was terrible"
bad,"go to work sign into phone and start talking calls end of shift theyd have a meeting my schedule was changed three times in a week without prior notice. we were all told to choose between work, school, and kids."
bad,"Training was great but it went down hill after that. No one said a thing till your in nesting that there is mandatory ot. I love ot but not if it is a every day thing. I should have the choice to work the ot if I want. I was told when hired 40 hours. Then told i have to work the it or I get fired.  Most of my day is fixing other reps mistakes lies or making up for them being lazy. They ride you on everything and never stand behind you even when they agree your right.There is no such things as support. Instead your told change your voice or look it up in doorways. The best one is you should know how to do your job. Well not all answers are in doorways!!!! Plus if our support would take the time to read the chat instead of being rude and lazy things would be faster and better all around. There is no respect for employees or care for them they are just a number. Oh and the like to mess with your pay I have pics of my iex and feps showing where the changed my hours so I did not get my overtime bonus. Thieves liar's and scammers not a company I would wish on anyone. Oh and the insurance they give us is bs 2,500 has to come out of pocket before I get help with the bills and I spend almost 400 a month for 3 people. Rip off much. The building is in bad repair 3 people last week cut their hands on bathroom doors. Only 2 sinks out of 6 work in women's bathroom. They make us all share head sets. So let's add cheap as well. Some people have been working there for 2 years and get paid only 8 an hour while new employees are getting paid 10.50 an hour just starting off."
bad,"would not recommend to a soul.. avoid avoid avoid"
bad,I dont advise anyone to go out there and work because there are no job security
bad,"I worked for the Medical Bill Review department at the Xerox on Yorkshire and I advise anyone to stay away and to not apply for a job here. The management is horrible. The boss has no knowledge of what to do when running a unit she depends on other people to do the work for her instead. The pay sucks. You start a low pay during training and then it turns over to piece rate and your pretty much making $9.50/hour on average. They change the piece rate rates at any given time without very much warning. The co-workers are dramafied and like to stir up mess everyday. The job is very hard to do since it consist of researching bills and debating whether to make payment on those bills. One wrong mistake and the internal QA hits you hard with errors which in the end will affect your paycheck. If you can put up with horrible pay, no room for advancement, a horrible boss then you should apply for this job. lol. I am glad to say I no longer work there."
bad,"Poor management, lack of information is the norm.  You're expected to know what you don't know.  NO raises in over 2 years. Point system for tardines. Maximum points are 4. No consideration/exception given regarding points even during multiple system issues reported.  No weather delay exceptions given.   Works as 3rd party vendor representing other companies and what the client wants is what they get. Schedule changes with only 1 week advance notice given. Mandatory Holiday schedule drafts with only 2 weeks notice given. Advancement only available via the buddy system. Improper/unprofessional behavior by management. Dirty work space, trash not emptied nightly and carpet not vacumed unless you bring your own which some associates have and were repremanded for doing so."
bad,"this was an awful place to work.  compensation was based on recorded calls weekly.  if there was one work that was excluded from the call or too much said on the call, then there was a mark down.  I dont miss that awful place."
bad,awful and just obnoxious people were rude with no structure or anything a free for all
bad,You will not progress at this company unless you have the right connections.
bad,"high turnover problem but nothing being done to solve the issue, if you do not fit in they find any way to terminate you. Supervisors not supportive. mandatory overtime that gets assigned with no advance warning to plan a head. terrible company."
bad,"Ghetto, unprofessional, another area for montrose. It's like a fashion show and dating career."
bad,"Management is the issue. It also depends on what contract they have you working under. I represented their Apple iTunes account. Any concerns I brought to management were never addressed. They would tell me they would get back to me and never would. They will switch your schedule with no notice. I went to my supervisor, general manager, work solutions, and human resources about concerns and received no help. Shift bids are a joke. Rate of pay advertised is deceitful and not consistent. The Bolingbrook, IL location has an EXTREMELY HIGH turnover rate due to the treatment we receive. They treat you like you have no common sense. There is no sure place to sit and even do your job. There were many days I clocked in late simply because I could not find an available and working computer to sign in on and take calls. I am praying for a call from another job so that I can leave this terrible place of employment."
bad,"they treat their agents like slaves with no pay. •a typical day at work"
bad,Not very happy with company. Management not very friendly nor helpful.
bad,worst place to work management sucks no support wouldnt recommend
bad,"Hire as many as possible see what happens. Workers are expendable. It is in the personality of everyone in management in the company. They don't care about families, your life besides the company, or your health and welfare."
bad,"Temporary job. Hardest part of this job was being laid off once I was told I would not be, and left with no job trying to figure out what to do next."
bad,"Lack of training before being put on production two days of training in Hardware and Networking, 3 days in accounts and retention. The work was not hard, could have done better with more training. In the 6 months I was there, the company went through 3 Operation Managers, my direct supervisor changed 8 times, my schedule changed 5 times and my time was never recorded properly. Never received a paycheck on time and if I did it was shorted and I had to wait for it to be corrected. There is no HR on the floor to help you. As for the pay I was told by recruiting that it was $9.50 while in training once you hit production its $10. The pay stayed at $9.50, the bonus pay changed and was not put into effect until the 4th month and changed again a month after."
bad,Worked here over 3 years and this is by far the worst call center I have ever seen
bad,"A typical day required complete awareness of continued changing of  responsibilities with very limited help for representatives whether they were new to call center environment or not.  Some management personnel very limited in willingness to help representatives satisfy customers. Horrible job security and advancement potential.  Job was never enjoyable, although co-workers were polite, hard working, and assisted one another as much as possible."
bad,"Management is horrible, whether your doing well or not you will not be recognized for your efforts. Coworkers are very lazy ignorant no one pulls their weight. Turnover is pretty high at the location I worked. I will never in my life want to work here again even if I were desperate."
bad,"This place had the worst, unprofessional environment of all time. Everyone could do basically whatever they wanted with absolutely no structure whatsoever. "
bad,"managers overbearing "

bad,"I worked for Ryder in Nashville TN and it was HORRIBLE!!! They don't care if you have a life outside of work like school, kids and etc. If you cant come in prepared to be given a point on a already horrible point system. When I signed up for my benefits I was pre-warned that what they offered didn't meet the basic requirements and wasn't an approved health plan based on regulations. Unless you brown nose and kiss tail then you can cancel any type of advancement. Management doesn't know a thing about the job and sets all these crazy expectations for the already pain the tush customers that I had to deal with on a regular basis. Not to mention when I was hired I was promised 12.00 an hour, but wasn't advised that I would only make that after I got out of training. NOT to mention the conditions of the work place was crazy! Poor excuse for security!( People were constantly robbed not only in the parking lot, but inside the building.) Sprint works in the same building and the T- Rash that came through those doors looked like residents of CWA off of Shelby Ave."
bad,"My first job at printing. It was very low key, so I was able to learn a great deal about the 6180 machines."
bad,"Xerox is a call center. In order to work in a call center you must have the personality to be 1 in 1400 employees. You will not receive personal attention or care in any way. You will be expected to stay on the phone for the majority of the day with only a couple of breaks. A typical day would look like this: arrive at work, you have 5 minutes before you are expected to start taking calls, depending on the time of day those calls could be back-to-back or have a couple of minutes in between, you will receive two 10 minutes breaks and a 30 minute lunch, during the rest of the time you will be expected to be taking calls unless you are previously scheduled for a meeting or other time off the phones. "
bad,"A typical day at work was assisting insurance customers with processing annual enrollment for participants and their families, for retirees as well and their dependants. Also processed pensions for survivors as well. I learned how to process government pensions and if I am blessed this is how it will be for me when I reach my golden years, moving a little slower, growing old gracefully. I saw just how challenging it can be managing 150 employees, dealing with so many different personalities, My manager did it with a smile. Some of my co-workers were like my family. The hardest part was getting laid off. The most enjoyable part of the job was waking up every morning thanking GOD for my good health and strength to go to work and assist the retirees with thier annual enrollment insurance with lots of care, patience, and understanding."
bad,I really enjoy working any type of job just as long as when I leave I feel good about what I did. I like to leave my members happy and knowing that there issues was solved
bad,"Too many Chiefs...not enough Indians..."
bad,"My time at Xerox was amusing, to say the least. The revolving door of employees, the unpaid benefits, the lack of support, it all gave a nice 'circus feel' to the place."
bad,If you are looking for temporary employment then this is a good place to do so.
bad,"Working for Xerox was not a good experience. Business not setup to gain the confidence of the clients or the workers. "
bad,"You will not be properly trained, you will be expected to do too much, you will not be looked at with human decency. I worked for this company for one and a half years. It was by far the worst job I've ever had. The management is never on the same page in an always changing environment. They let corrosive events like sexual harassment and bomb threats go unnoticed. Without the support of your management team you will receive unlimited amount of customer phone calls being called the worst things in existence, and then you have to follow the charade of caring about their phony needs. In my time there I saw the turn over of about one hundred employees. Do not expect a career working here. The only positive thing I can say is that if you can stand to be there they offer lots of overtime. I could never find the resilience to do so. This is where dreams go to die."
bad,This place was the most stressful place I have ever worked! You are constantly being threatened with your job and you have to deal with angry customers over their drug insurance.
bad,"I had worked for a Xerox center in another state and loved it. When I went to this project, it was terrible. We were making so much less then those on a different project in the same center. Our leadership was terrible. We had such terrible training that we literally went to Google to find the troubleshooting steps as our systems were so insanely difficult to use. Our bonus checks were never on time, and the people who got promoted were literally just friends with management, or in some cases, slept with management. I was truly disgusted with how this center was run. Before I left, they literally had us doing 15 hours of mandatory overtime a week."
bad,Work environment was undesirable. I was brought in from outside and the current employees were so hungry to be promoted that they did anything they could to make me leave - as if it were my fault they weren't promoted. This place was always receiving bad press during my tenure. Glad to leave.
bad,I am a very upbeat and outgoing worker. I have done cusotmer servcies for about 10 years. This job is bottom of the barrel. NOt famly friendly. Not employee friendly. Just not happy place to work.
bad,"A typical day involved sitting down at a work station and answering inbound calls for the client.  I learned a lot about wireless technologies, contracts, and services.  Upper management and HR were completely inaccessible; lower mgmt rarely went to bat for a rep when a bad survey rolled in.  Training is focused on how to do the job from a technical standpoint--no training as to how to deal effectively with rude, ignorant, belligerent callers.  No adequate explanation of pay (which can be $12/hr one day and $9/hr for the next ten days).  Basically, your pay is determined by how well callers ""like"" you.  Sounds easy enough until someone curses you out over a bill they owe but can't pay.  No mention of mandatory overtime.  Cheap, gimmicky ""incentives"" like  hotdogs and ""the chance to win"" a $20 gift card from Walmart if you take 70 calls in a shift (which is very hard to do unless you sit for 12 hours or so).  Basically, you get hired to be used to the max for a little while but soon get fired for reasons beyond your control (like a customer fails a survey because you couldn't given them some outrageous credit on a bill) or quit out of pure disgust.  The ONLY good things were that hours were plentiful for those who wanted to work over 40 and, as I said, you can learn a lot about the wireless industry.  Coworkers seemed okay but the overall environment is absolutely toxic. My training class had 30+ people in it, and after 6 months only 4 of us remained.  Good for a paycheck but talk to people who work there before committing.  The trainers will NOT give you an accurate, realistic"
bad,"Very little to No training.  Fights broke out in training room, Manager fired for sexual harrasment of a new employee week 3!  Lied about time of work project and then lied the day they let most people go saying project ended in a week.  Everyone talked about everyone,  Managers RELATIVES worked in new hires and then where retained even with terrible to low performance!  VERY VERY VERY bad company!  good luck trying to get someone to speak to you in English regarding benefits or payroll!  You are a number not a person!  Local HR is a joke...when you take any problems to them NOTHING gets done.  BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE"
bad,"They will hire hundreds of people at once then start to fire them little by little until there are not enough people to handle the work load. When you are hired you will be a part time worker, but when you are hired to full time time they cut your pay. They say it is to pay for your benefits. I never saw any benefits. They do not train you well enough to handle the customers who do call."
bad,"A typical day at work for a Customer Care Associate would be taking back to back calls for the client. Dealing with system issues 80% of the time. Having to deal with angry customers and team members because of these system issues that have been happening for almost half a year."
bad,"No chance for advancement, no raises, hard to work your way up, you have to kiss up to advance. Didn't like it a bit."
bad,"Leadership team lacks professionalism, ethics, trust and is not accountable for anything! Operations Managers are clueless and or place their responsibilities on their supervisors and or team leads. "
bad,"No reviews, no culture, no HR accountability, no continuous improvement or training, autocratic management, filthy computer key boards, very superficial and uncaring place, no heart, no soul, very low pay, high turn over.  Management have no people skills and are disrespectful to the underlings...don't be fooled by superficial behavior that they care...it's them selling themselves that they are doing the right thing...delusional."
bad,"you dont wanna know."
bad,"If you need customer service experience it is a good place to get that experience.  If you start working there, get your 6 months to 1 year experience and move on.  Management is poor and job security is poor."
bad,they do not know how to run their company they have poor management skills and the pay is inconsistant
bad,"A typical Day at work, consist of assisting print customers with any account issues or questins"
bad,"This is by far the worst place I have ever worked! I worked here for two years. I was promoted by i did not get a rasise they dont give those,  I was giving a shift differental(which is taxed). Anyone is hired, this is a VERY stressful call center. Management talks to you any kind of way, the rules only apply to certain people. they force you to work OT. everyone works on saturdays ALL DAY. Customers that call in are rude, no floor support, supervisors and managers and messy. No time off, some holidays are NOT paid. New call center manager that does not have expericance, Operation manager uses VERY unprofessional language when talking to agents. If you need a job for a few months just to get by Xerox is perfect.... BUT DONT THINK YOU ARE GOING TO ADVANCE MUCH AND DONT EXCEPT THE WORK AND TIME THAT YOU PUT IN TO REFLECT IN PAY."
bad,"Xerox is a busy job its always on a queue, I learned to be much more quicker especially at typing and solving problems. The management their was pretty good but when it came to communication it was very bad they always changed schedule and not let me know until I would come in to my regular shift and I would always get a warning for it? The hardest part of the job was probably that it took a lot of your energy so you needed to take breaks frequently and I don't really like to do that but it helped a lot! I like to be focused on my job not take frequent 10 min breaks. The most enjoyable part was maybe my pay that's it because I would put in the hours I needed and I would get paid good for It and I loved it!"
bad,"1. The day starts with planning with my fellow team members."
bad,"Given my job, Xerox doesn't offer any training that's applicable. Only Xerox created, online training for unrelated topics. Everything else is on your own time. I recently heard of some FREE training that was happening locally. The short answer about whether I could attend was no."
bad,"Currently in training for my position as a telephone-banker for Xerox. I have 4 weeks left of it, and I may say that I want out of this company already! I'm unhappy here. The environment sucks! No cell phones, purses etc. Management is bossy, and cares about themselves, the people that work there are ignorant and act like children--the majority of them are children and the pay is stupidly low! "
bad,Its a mess no one is EVER on the same page and if you have a problem OH WELL it will never get solved
bad,"Xerox is like a college campus, i worked at the Cary NC location, no job security, your job is based on pretty much how the customer feels about sprint, you can not control how the customer feels about sprint or what they put on a survey. i would not recomend trying to make that place a permanent place of empoyment. maybe some temp money but not stable at all"
bad,"Very unprofessional, shift hours vary and operation managers do not follow chain of command"
bad,"I work for Xerox, who is a vendor site for Apple."
bad,"I accepted this job under great duress. They only hire on a ""project"" basis which is a nice way of saying temporary to avoid providing employees with benefits of any kind. I and a group were hired and told that although this was ""project based"" that it was very likely we would be kept on full time provided we performed adequately. This was definitely not the case and management was obviously trained to maintain this illusion. Up until the last week of our ""project"", employees were kept in the dark. This isnt a unique process, this is how the entire company is structured and there is NO job security unless you're lucky enough to know someone and make it to management and even then, you're still expendable. If you are terribly desperate for work, they run call centers for Boost mobile and the compensation is ENTIRELY performance based, meaning that its based on the amount of calls. The company is wicked, the work is unrewarding and the employees are treated like livestock."
bad,"If you like low wages, high stress, unfair standards, and long hours this job is for you."
bad,"Training was a joke, it was as if you were back in junior high . Huge gaps in knowledge needed to do the job. Two systems and only training on one was given. Instructors push trainees through to meet quota, not to have fully trained employees. No training on new processes or devices, Really the worst training I have ever received."
bad,"The systems only work half of the time, I am in the sales department and the system never keeps adequent count of my sales therefore I never recieve the correct payment for sales that I make. The cosistantly perform updates the the system without providing proper training or notification. The building is filthy, the microwaves are so dirty that you cant heat up your lunch and they canceled the lunch program so the only option you have to eat is to order takeout."
bad,"If i had been working for Xerox, I think things may have been different.  But Xerox was contracting customer service reps to Verizon Wireless for one of their call centers, and after working there for one year I could not drag myself into work for another second.  No one cared at all how difficult the job was, how demanding the conditions were, or that no one could make enough to survive, even with overtime.  It was the second worst working experience of my life.  The Navy still takes the cake."
bad,"Avoid this place at all costs unless no other employer will take you due to the teardrop tattoo or the fact that you wear a Dragonball flame shirt to job interviews.The hours are long, the work is incredibly stressful, and the management consists almost entirely of childish imbeciles. If you want to be yelled at by racist elderly people over the phone over a $2 service charge while management breathes down your neck for taking an 11 minute break, this is the career for you. There is very little opportunity for advancement, despite what the recruiting material says, and a horrific workplace culture that has spawned the motto ""fake it until you make it"". This attitude is so widespread that I have even overheard supervisors and administrators espouse this awful slogan, which seems to embody the entirety of the questionable business practices employed by this company. The one thing which has kept me as an employee here is the fact that some of the senior staff such as my own supervisor and other senior agents are actually caring people with decent work ethic, a trait not found in many of the motley idiots that replace these experienced and skilled team members and leaders as they move on to other more worthwhile employment with companies that actually value seniority and experience. The entire goal seems to be to squeeze as much profit out of employees as they can by placing as much pressure on them as humanly possible with before they inevitably burn out, quit, or get fired over a variety of petty and innumerable rules and policies. The company hires new employees continuously"
bad,"A typical day at work is answering calls from mean, nasty, awful customers who have been waiting on hold for a very long time because there is not enough people to answer the calls that come in and then they don't get answers to their questions because nobody has been trained by the horrible management. The only thing I have learned is DO NOT WORK FOR XEROX! The Management is awful. They manage by threatening you with ""write ups"" instead of trying to help and every day I have to go to work there is one step closer to hell. Do yourself a favor and stay away. The hardest part of the job is just going there and there is really nothing good about it. It's dirty, there are bugs all over, one restroom for 100 people. 10 minute breaks and the building smells."
bad,"I personally do not like xerox, I think the management at xerox was horrible, I learned how easy it is to work on the phones but the protection of your job is slim to none."
bad,I don't really want to write a review on my current employer. I have learned one lesson working here. I now know how I would like to be treated in a work environment now and not to say its a bad environment i just would like more communication.
bad,Its not the best place to work pay is very confusing. Hours are good if you need them theres always an hour of mandatory overtime that you have to do which last i checked is not legal in Washington but they find ways of making little things that are not legal legal like breaks and lunches.
bad,This is a non oraginze company.Ther is no job security in the company itself.It was a toatal wate of my time.
bad,Xerox should be ashamed and embarrassed.  Talk about taking advantage.  At least I don't have to travel to a third world country to feel the affects discrimination and banishment.  I thought I lived in the United States of America with SOME rights but according to TMS Health and Xerox I have NO rights!!!
bad,"Handling lots of calls, requests and technical lingo. I learned a ton about multiple softwares. The management was inconsistent and so was the information passed down to employees. The hardest part was meeting unrealistic metrics. The most enjoyable part of the job was fixing peoples problems."
bad,"The call center/ business solutions side has a very high turnover rate. Employees are given goals and objectives that are changed on what appears to be a daily basis. The mismanagement of projects and lack of communication to employees is the worst I have experienced. Managers are expected to work extreme hours, up to 70 a week on a salary that equates to less than minimum wage. The facilities are not well kept and dirty most days."
bad,"While working there, I had no family life. I worked 10-12 hour days 5-6 days a week.  You are not valued there at all, no matter how hard you work, unless you have friends in management, you will not advance. If you do work there, don't get sick as they do not care how sick you are, they will write you up if you miss work at all. The management sends mixed signals to all the employees."
bad,"If I could rate Xerox less than one star I would. The pay structure they call ABC pay is dumb. If a customer fails your survey it tanks your pay and you have to wait 30 DAYS for it to fall off to get back to ""top tier"" pay which is 13.00. Management plays favorites and they don't follow the rules like no eating on the floor or no cell phones on the floor; but if your a suck up you can get away with this. Constantly saw sexual harassment that was reported to HR and nothing was done about it. If you have a customer escalating the supervisors have you transfer to the sup line and take over an hour to answer the call which gives the customer time to click over to the call coming in from the survey line and fail you which 99.9% of the time is none disputable. Good luck getting a survey disputed. I did a experiment to see who makes more money myself or my 16 yr. old niece working at McDonald's and she made more than me. Overall if Verizon was smart they would take this contract away from Xerox and get a better company to handle their customers. I would not wish this place on my worst enemy."
bad,"This company management teams are not equipped to actually know about the benefits, and many of the manager target certain employees."
bad,"This was one of the worst company's I have ever worked for. This company has u work mandatory over time each day, your pay changes daily and you never know what your paycheck will be. The management is very rude and has high expectations. Yet is sleeping with agents and exploits employees business to others.  you don't get no where in that company.  You get written up for things you have no control over . You get your shifts changed monthly and get in trouble to use the restroom. I have seen so many faces come in and out of that business its crazy , its like a sweat shop. I have seen girls have there monthly period and bleed all over themselves and have management question about sending them home.  I have never felt so uncomfortable in an work environment.  "
bad,Complete idiots with the highest turnover rate I have ever seen.  I was management and could not believe how upper management conducted business.  People are treated like dogs and slaves.  You will never get a red cent for a raise even though you will be led to believe you are.  No room for advancement.  Watch out. Beware. I was fired and did absolutely nothing wrong.  Drama.  Do not waste your time.  You will get more satisfaction and gratification working at wawa or walmart. 
bad,"they are very unorganized, systems always not working, one person will tell you one thing and another person tells you another. AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY TRY TO ACT LIKE THE PLACE IS A JAIL! You never get the truth until it's too late. just don't even apply!!"
bad,"The management team of the company I work for ""sucks"". Everyone of them is ghetto(I'm not sure if I spelled it correctly)!   Hard work with little pay."
bad,"This company is terribly unorganized and unprofessional. They do a great job at selling the company to you, but once you get through training, they treat you awful. "
bad,"very unorganized and bad leadership, rules change by the hour and nothing is consistent. employees are unhappy and under paid "
bad,biggest mistake i ever did was apply here.  the entire ghetto of anderson works there.  
bad,working here is most bad days in my life. no values . poor management. very stressful work. first you hear customer complain all days. then if your call hit ten . supervisor will be yelling on you. company is hire more people than first week in production floor . people get fired. 
bad,This job was less than desirable. Basically a bunch of children (including management) running the place. The pay was a extremely low seeing that in six months I had been uptrained three times to new positions with no pay increase. Would not recommend this job! 
bad,"This company is not very well organized, at all. They do not do a good job of pre-screening employees or training them to conduct themselves professionally while on phone calls."
bad,"A typical day is a minimum of 10 hours for exempt employees.  Benefits are pathetic.  As far as culture & values, management needs to practice what they preach more so than anyone.  There is no work/life balance.  Expect to have no life, a ton of stress, no job security and pathetic benefits.  Be sure to use your PTO (paid time off) before leaving employment here - they will not give it to you in NY."
bad,"Management is disorganized. Duties change every 10 minutes. "
bad,"HR (Brenda Medina) does not listen to any complaints that we bring forward including harassment and bullying. They pretty much imply that the company does not care about you because you are replaceable since new people are applying every day. The management has no idea how to run the company and pick and chose who is allowed to break the rules and who does not. Save yourself the time and do not apply at Xerox, unless you want a glimpse of what hell on earth is like. "
bad,"I worked here for six months as an in between job (like most other people here). I dreaded going into work every single day. Management here is really hard to tolerate and so are the customers. The first three months working here is all training then learning lab (two weeks), then production. Consider other options with this company such as working as a recruiter. They are always hiring new people so they always need a recruiter who can find lots of new people."
bad,"I learned how to help members with their Medicare part D plan, and how to place prescription orders and refills and how to help member resolve their issues. I learned how to use Avaya Phone system and people safe software."
bad,"You arrive at work and better clock into the phone system within 60 seconds of your start time or you have earned 1/4 of a point towards disciplinary action. As you take calls during the beginning of the day you are nervous because a failed survey will lower your pay for a month. There is an appeal process but it is weighted against you because they can always say the problem was your tone even though none of the supervisors or Ops. Mgrs. I spoke with were ever trained in paralinguistics. A failed survey also earns you a disciplinary action. You were paid for every second that you were on an inbound call, so if there are few calls then you are earning few dollars (as low as minimum wage). Your pay changes daily and at the location where I worked the maximum you could earn if you were on the phone every second of your shift was $13.80. You could not even enjoy the company of your co-workers because you could not get to know them as you tried to stay available all the time to take calls. On occasion management would buy cheeseburgers from McDonalds (and you could have only 1) or breakfast sandwiches (and you could have only 1). Benefits may as well have been non-existent because of the amount of the premium that had to be paid by the employee."
bad,"Our training was 3 months and started with 30 people. I quit after a month and half while in tbay..... heard only 3 people graduated from our class. the training was was 5 weeks in the classroom, 4 weeks in T-bay, and 4-weeks in production. After classroom training, everyone in our class didnt know what to do on the phone since they never taught us before.On First week of tbay we were getting survey. if customer gives you 7 or below, they will automatically give you a white slip ( 3 slip and you're fired). each day someone quit since 10 per hour isn't worth it with the frustration coming from the supervisor, customer and the job itself. All my calls were 10 except for 2 calls . On my 2nd slip i decided to quit . since it's better to quit than to get fired. It was the best feeling ever and now i work in downtown Seattle with stress free environment and pays more :)"
bad,I applied to Xerox thinking I could make a career out and advance in the company. Boy I was wrong. Xerox does not value its employee in any way shape or form. I could be wrong but I always thought employers was suppose to contribute to an employees professional and personal growth. Not the case with Xerox. Xerox is what I call Disability Bigots.
bad,"Do not work for this company for it will be the worst mistake of your life. They do not care about you as a person, they just care about getting bodies in seats. They don't care about the customer, they just care about the money they are bringing in. The environment is stale and boring, and management does not know their foot from their, well you know. on the Tech Support side, half the supervisors don't even know how to troubleshoot complex issues, they just tell you to check the Knowledge Base (KB) even when the KB says to escalate to a supervisor. If you want to be treated like a robot and as if all you are is a drone in a mighty collective then join WDS, but if you want to be treated like a person then go anywhere else. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!"
bad,"Management is by far the worst. They do not care about employees, they just want to fill a desk and have anyone take a phone call. Training is poor because they have people training who does not have any knowledge of the product. They believe that a company can be ran without managers and supervisors knowing the product."
bad,"I worked for these cheap b.s.a.r.s for two years before my job went overseas. Management doesn't care about anyone but themselves. They lied to us constantly about the amount of work we would get and our pay. Went to piece rate pay and no one could tell us how a complicated excel spreadsheet broke down our pay. Was hired for a full-time 40 hour a week job, but you were sent home when we ran out of work."
bad,Xerox abuses their employees. There were times where they would make you work through you lunch and breaks. It was a very hostile environment due to management constantly hassling employees. Supervisors would avoid taking calls from customers who would request to speak to a supervisor. Work force would chase you down to yell at you if your call with a customer would last more than 8 minutes. I would never work for this company again.
bad,Pay is measly. Managers are salaried and expected to work 50+ hours a week and take on call. There are way too many layers of management. I managed a team of RN Case Managers (Health ServicesConsultants). All of them hated the company and culture. We were so under-staffed that I had to take up my own caseload in addition to my management duties and filling in the for the director (she quit because it was awful). Upper management was not receptive to new ideas and did not like change. Micromanagement all the way.
bad,It was a job selling Xerox gear and services in a defined territory.
bad,"pay is terrible and they offer no raises, not even after training."
bad,Deeded Development
bad,This jobs sucks
bad,no room to advance anywhere. no one gives a hoot about anything. i am not even sure why i work there. everyone is just miserable.
bad,"This place is a joke. The people are ghetto, the management is unprofessional and they do not care about the team members at all."
bad,"Do not work for this company, not only do they lie about the pay, it is very unprofessional, management is unprofessional, hardly any floor support, when you ask for help managemnt doesnt want to do their job,, ""learning lab."" And training is a joke."
bad,"I was fired for not having the proper registration on my Texas vehicle?? Go figure, it was proper, and in date?? So be careful.No one ever informed me about having proper registration on my vehicle would get me fired. There are possibly better companies to work for like Arby's or Taco Bell. Not kidding, This was a disappointing job I highly suggest you move on to better things.There is no job security and its all about the numbers. There is no real support for your job. Good Luck"
bad,Managers discourage you from advancing within the company. Its rare that anyone is promoted within the company. Very low pay and no raises.
bad,The pay is very low. It's very difficult to hit all the metrics they require unless you've been there a long time.
bad,"If I could give zero stars I would. A 15 year employee and the last 6 without a merit increase. Always looking behind you for the axe, layoffs every 6 months, no one is safe. I'd accept a position at McDonalds before working at ACS/Xerox"
bad,"I was lied to about the position. It isn't data entry, you hve to use function keys to manuever through the dociuments. In documents, the rates are so high that you can't even make unemployment, so they ""graciously"" compensate up to minimum wage. Management threatens you daily. Mandatory overtime."
bad,"I have been with this company for over three years and although I love my supv and peers. The work enviorment, benefits, and pay is not good at all."
bad,WDS is the by far the worst company I have ever worked for in my life. They pay the least of any call center in the Boise area. Then on top of that they offer the worst benefits package. They do offer a better benefits package if you are in management. They have the highest attrition rate of any call center that I have been evolved in. That is because they don't treat there employees well. The work environment is poor. The desks are the smallest desk I have ever seen in a call center. They are stacked right next to each other so they can fit as many desks in there as they can. The customers complain all the time that they cannot hear you because it is too loud. The only positive thing about that place is some of the people are cool. That and as long as you have a pulse they will hire you. That is why I say it is a good stop gap. They will try to accomedate a schedule for you because they try everything they can to keep an employee. Hence why there Attendance policy is lax.
bad,"The supervisors don't care about anyone but themselves, The pay is not nearly enough, not a good company."
bad,These companies that Xerox have required from other companies will soon definitely affect the overall business practices that Xerox have worked so hard for through the years.
bad,"If I could give it no stars on all fronts, I would. I like my coworkers and customers, but have nothing good to say about the company."
bad,I worked there for 4 years and they just don't value there employees
bad,"This place is ran by kids, who are hungover riding on scooters running around like kids on crack. Supervisors don't even know how to work or answer questions you ask, they say ask someone else. I am not sure if Xerox knows what is going on, but they should look into who is running their business. Not professional at all. I will never work in a call center again. Please think twice, not worth it. No chance to advance, lied to and never promoted."
bad,"They lie about the pay, the supportive organization, and do not care at all about employees or their family's safety. Xerox operates like a sweat shop - the call centers are the dirty little secret where the employees are numbers."
bad,"Terrible environment. Terrible management. Everyone is very correct in saying that Xerox management is really bad. They care nothing about you. They are all cold, heartless beings. And the whole work environment is bad. They don't give you the resources to do your job. The compensation was only good for me because I was a temp employee. But, I didn't have paid time off and right before I quit, they wanted to start everyone on th infamous ABC compensation program which has had some lawsuits over. I can't believe that it's not illegal. But, I avoided that disaster."
bad,"Sweat shop. Intend to just run people in and out of there. Weak management and human resources. Unfriendly environment, poorly lighted facilities. Work center approximately 3 feet wide by 2 feet deep. Poor training."
bad,"A miserable place, with miserable people, and miserable pay. Do not work here if you are prone to suicidal tendencies."
bad,"A typical day consists of incoming calls from people who needs help making a hotel,car or flight reservation. Other callers need help with existing reserations such as their hotel is overbooked, or the car rental agency won't accept their debit card as form payment for deposit."
bad,"They have a high termination rate , they like to pay you by call instead of hourly their respect for their employee's is beyond not satisfying and their managment is terrible I truthfully don't even see why they even still have that site up anyway bottom line it was just a terrible experience dealing with that company ."
bad,this place is horrible death in the family they fired me on top i broke my rib at work they put me back on the phones bleeding for two hours or told me id loose my job management is horrid most of the sups have a clique and are sitting listening to music on there iphones etc ignoring employees hands pay is horrible benefit has a cap on it gossip drama backstabbing head hunting company with no morals...plus if u get a customer sexually assaulting u on the phone u cant hang up !!!!
bad,I love my trainers the very fun and entertaining as well as my co workers in my training class.The job is truely stressful. You get fussed at if you are a couple minutes late from your lunch or break. The pay is only good if there is alot of calls coming and if you pass all your surveys. It's not very motivating to come to work everyday and work a 9hr shift and only make $60-$80 a day. Supervisors stand around and talk having a good ole time while the agents put in all the work... You are forced to do mandatory overtime...This is most definitaly a starter job being that i am new to the area and all. I would recommend anyone to work here unless they were truly desperate.
bad,"If you like having your creativity stifled, enjoy worrying about job security, being paid under market value and not being valued as an individual, then the Breakaway Group is for you!"
bad,It's a call center job that requires a personal to have little none issue resolutions. Your job depends on whether some ignorant customers find your performance to be helpful despite the fact that they are unable to see or properly evaluate your performance. Stay far away from this company
bad,Dont work here unless you are desperate for a job and mean reslly desperate
bad,"After starting a 7 day training class, our trainer was hardly ever in the classroom and when she was, her recent class graduates would ""stop in"" and interrupt class on a daily basis. We were rushed through a training program to only take basic calls for Medicare customers but instead we were put out on the floor after our training and started taking calls outside our training knowledge. Along with other recently graduated classes, we were sat at computers to take live calls without ever listening to more than a couple of hours of calls TOTAL! I found myself fighting with my trainer/supervisor about my schedule, my hours in which she (and management supporting her) was trying to short me out of hours and say I wasn't working all my hours. After trying to prove my case, multiple times, I finally decided this was not the place for me and decided I'd much rather be at home with my daughter than waste anymore of my time at this deadend, ridiculous place! I wasn't the only one in my training class who felt this way, but not everyone was lucky enough to be able to stay at home when a job gets this ridiculous."
bad,Typical day log into phone answer customer questions using your knowledge or try to search for addition info with poor search engine.
bad,I worked here for almost a year. I have nothing good to say about this company other than it was a job. The environment was so unprofessional and unethical!!! They hire anyone as long as you don't have a felony it seemed like. The supervisors are lazy and don't want to do anything except get money from their agents stats and gossip. Nothing is set in stone here. The rules and regulations change like the weather. The management in general sucks and they don't know how to speak to or treat the employees. The site in Cary is dirty and had bed bugs at one point. The pay constantly changes. They care more about getting positive surveys than spending time with each customer to resolve their issues. Worst job I ever had! It's not worth the stress or little money.
bad,"The traing is great, the management leadership, pay and benifits leave EVERYTHING to be desired. Most startup have better organizational skills and leadership then they do"
bad,"I worked in a call center providing technical support for Sprint. More than 50% of our training class quit before training was over. The compensation structure was convoluted and customers suffered. A customer who needed to be transferred to be helped would often not be because 'transfers' negatively impact your pay. The rules and policies constantly changed. The trainers were excellent, but the transition to the floor was poorly managed--and the correct procedure to help a customer is far different from what you need to do to hit your numbers. Every move is monitored--you may or may not get a 30 minute lunch break and you WILL be treated like a child--you have to ask to get up and go to the bathroom. Every directive from management includes a threat that failure to follow whatever rule is cause for termination. I would rate every employer I have worked for in 25 years with 4 or 5 stars--except this place. Truly a horrible experience."
bad,"Xerox or ACS, a rose by any other name still stinks. Changing the name will not make their reputation any better. They still pay $9 to $9.50 an hour and want to work you like a slave. Of course you can have all the overtime you can handle, that way they don't have to give you a raise. By the way, there is no such thing as ""mandatory overtime"". No organization, always a revolving door with employees, it's a mess!"
bad,Typical workday began (7:30 am) with reviewing emails to ensure;
bad,A typical day at work would be going to your desk and answering phones. its very hard to find help in the buliding.
bad,Typical day - work 10-12 hours
bad,"Working at Xerox was mostly stressful. It was a very demanding job with no place for advancement. My co-workers were the best part of the job. People were friendly and very helpful in time of need. Now as far as management, they did not know exactly how to do or know the job of their employees. That was very annoying to me because if you had a problem with your work you could not go to them to get answers. The hardest part about the job was coming to work and not knowing if you were going to have a job."
bad,*A day for work for me is to make sure I provide customers with out of this world service on every call
bad,"A typical day at xerox is like going to a high school. The supervisors are Kids that are only 18, 19, maybe 20 years old that have never been a supervisor or know how to manage people. These kid supervisors have only experience working at the hamburger places. There is no good management for people working there to support you. The stress of the job is not so much on the customers calling in....it is from supervisors....the customers want the Verizon prepaid phones for Free...but the supervisors tells you that you can not tell them that it is Verizon Policy not to give out credits on their bills....so you have to lie or hope that the customers don't get mad at you or just yells at you and hangs up ...because they will tell you at Xerox the only thing that matters is that you pass your surveys with a 8,9,10 ....these customers that cant pay their bills are the ones that decide if you get to keep your job or not....even though they don't want or cant pay their bills....This place will not last long....this was the worst call center I have ever worked at ....It is poorly managed and poorly ran. Beware of this place...if you go to work there...don't expect any support and keep looking for a job...because the kid supervisors will tell you one day that they just don't need you any more... the only pay is the 10 per hour is all you will see and the bonus for the surveys....never happens...they change the rules ever other day....and supervisor only make 12 per hour with no overtime...so don't waste your time with them....no body lasts with them...."
bad,"I started working for ACS in 2010 as a call center rep, from my first day on the production floor it has been disorganized chaos!!!! The management at this site is awful, since I started there have been several changes in Gen Mgrs as well as Asst Gen Mgrs, Supervisors etc.... The pay is horrible, you are not advised in training that overtime is mandatory, management saves that information until you arrive on the production floor. The site in Anderson, IN is not clean!! agents are constantly sick, there is a foul odor eminating from the building and several agents with terrible hygiene. Since Xerox purchased ACS I thought the work environment would get better, well it has not if anything it has continued to decline. Constant misdirection from management , they fail to recognize and retain the best employees, instead choosing to was time and resources on ineffective training. I dreaded the drive to work everyday. The site is a cesspool Management having inappropriate relationships with agents. I would not recommend this job to anyone with a brain!!! I learned there are greater things in store for me, and I did met several great co-workers who I can and do consider friends"
bad,"A typical business day consisted of cold calling new and potential customers to promote products and services. Generating proposals through ValueQuix, internal company software, and presenting to new and existing customers. Renewing previously established leases to develop and maintain business relationships. Setting up appointments with decision makers for demos or to gather information on business needs."
bad,I was a Xerox employee assigned to work the mail room in an international engineering company. The company expectations were unrealistic and they tried to manage us with people who had no idea how a mail room works.
bad,I was told that the position would be for 18 months but after 6 I got a phone call while I was leaving work telling me that that was my last day of work.
bad,"This is a terrible job. You will be paid barely above minimum wage. You have a trillion rules to follow, and you get in trouble for taking more than 3 minutes for a restroom break. The client that sets the rules has never had any experience taking calls, and they set unrealistic expectations. You have to get 95% QA score on calls, but you get marked down for EVERYTHING-typos, giving too much information to a person (as you are not allowed to tell them the truth), trying to help a student with a fafsa, not giving a 5 minute closing at the end of the call in which you have to verify every peice of demographic information all over again (most people just hang up). You are not allowed to transfer a call to a supervisor. Also, the supervisors are not promoted based on seniority, but upon how much the manager likes them. I knew more than my supervisor did but they dont post jobs openinings for supervisor positions so you can even apply for a management position. Its done under the table. You will get written up for taking more than 15 minutes for a break (I miscalculated and took 17 minutes and got written up). Lunches and breaks are auto generated by the computer and so if you come to work at 8, one day your lunch may be at 12:45, next day its at 10, next day its at 11. Many employees cry in their car before work, or in the bathroom at work. Leaving that place was the happiest day of my life. There are multiple contracts to work for (verizon, boost mobile, direct loans, multiple colleges financial aid) but they are ALL horrible and I would not wish working there on my worst enemy."
bad,The company management team is very unorganized and self oriented. They only care about if something will ultimately benefit them and not the team in a whole.
bad,"Dealing with high levels of complaints and high call volume coupled with pathetic pay and benefits, at one point I was literally doing twice the work of some of my coworkers and getting paid the same amount. Unpredictable shift changes that made it difficult to get a routine in place and there is no extra compensation for the nightshift even though the day shift was so heavily contended. The favoritism shown by managers not based on performance but by some arbitrary system of whomever complained the most left me to walk out on that nightmare of a job. A cramped cubicle under which i had to sit at an angle because the space was so small, bed bugs in the office, having to get to work 15-20 minutes before your shift began just to show up on time because the only parking was across new circle road and it could take 15-20 minutes wait on the shuttle OR risk walking over a bridge with a narrow footpath and low railing. The building itself is an eyesore."
bad,Not a good company to work for at all. They have Achievement-. Based Compensation (ABC) which is not at all a fair program. The benefits are not reachable for a family. The advancement is slow.
bad,A friend just got fired from this place she was a moldel empolyee great stats never missed a day.. she got fired cause she did her job correctly on a threating call one head person stood up foe her but vzw let her go she was the only one i knew that like her job an was a top employee
bad,"Many many meetings here but, nothing ever gets acted on since the whole place is in transition; Only safe place to be might be in services but, that remains to be seen. It was a good place to work with a bunch of smart and fun people, but management has taken care of that."
bad,alot more to the job than informed of when interviewing for the position. pay rate never the same.
bad,"Inbound calls from NJ EZ Pass customers on billing inquiries,service availability,product use,updating accouts,web assistance,toll inquires and placing toll disputes for investigations."
bad,"The pay here was horrible. They want employees to work for $9/hr when the job is worth around $13/hr. The policies change like the wind. I've noticed that the company tries to find ways to make employees not reach the bonuses. One of the worst things is that they cut everybody's hours and promised to give them back; four months passed and no one has seen those hours. On a positive note, if you do not have any work experience or just need a job to hold you off until the one you want comes up, then by all means seek employment here. Xerox is just a good way to beef up your resume. In summation, I would not recommend working here."
bad,While working at Xerox (a printer company) our printer for our badges was down for a month and a half...lol. the management is a joke they do not follow up on any work related issues and they make financial promises and do not follow through with them. Paychecks are never rite and it takes weeks if not months to correct the issue. The requirements to meet goals change several times a day. Supervisors and Support staff are unwilling to help the agents without giving attitude and being degrading to the individual. the computers crash constantly and the Sprint and Nextel customers are always angry as they are paying for the worst cell service that exists. For an example if a customer is upset about an outage in their area we are not allowed to compensate them until the issue has been resolved by support staff that sometimes does not get done for months at a time and you can not contain the call...you get a no survey and your pay gets cut up to 2.50 an hour because of it.
bad,"I would never recommend anyone work for ACS/Xerox. For Xerox to be such a large company you'd think they'd do better overall (awesome culture, good pay, etc). However, this is not the case at all. This is a terrible, terrible, terrible place to work. The pay sucked and management was a joke. ABC pay is a gimmick to lure you in and set your expectations really high that you may one day make a higher salary, but truth be told their matrix-like pay system (which nobody really understands) is designed to put more money in the company pockets and less into yours. Run from this compnay! The only good thing about this place was the awesome co-workers and friends I made...other than that...nothing really good to say. I learned nothing of value, even the training was bad (crash course to say the least). Oh! And you have to wait 6 months for your benefits to kick in! So if you or your family needs to see a doctor you're out of luck."
bad,"Respond to, handle and resolve customer inquiries"
bad,trainers treat you like you are stupid and don't help.
bad,"I started out there when the company was just ACS before the Xerox buy out and it was a terrible place to work then and then Xerox bought ACS and then made a bunch of promises that they were going to make the placed a better place to work, and that they were going to show appreciation for their employees, but instead things became worse they renegotiated the contract with our client in such a manner that it made our bonuses unattainable. Our General Manager tampered with employees pay directly telling the admin dept to only correct the pay for the people who notice the mistakes in theor paychecks and to not correcct the other ones that go unmentioned despite the fact that he and the admin dept knew about the pay error and this continued on for over 3 months before the head of the admin dept was replaced by a guy who had morales and turned the GM in to the ethics commitee and then he stated that the mistake was just caused by payroll being turned in late, The insurance benefits sucks as well as the dental sucks as well. and they have zero concern for their employees well fare DO NOT WORK THERE UNLESS YOU ARE ON THE VERGE OF BEING HOMELESS OR STARVING TO DEATH"
bad,"I worked for Xerox for 12 years until they bought ACS. Acs started to run xerox like there company(ACS). Acs lowered all associates pay by 50% and then told the associates in order to get back upto your pay scale you have to do more production jobs, if you do not you will be suspended and then fired if it is not up to ACS. I worked for xerox in minnesota. Xerox does not care about associates and they do get rid of people if you stick up for your self. I worked with a lot of great associates at xerox but because the way xerox is going down hill all the great associates have left the company. The CEO of xerox does not care about her employees"
bad,I work and have worked 100+ hours every paycheck for mandatory OT
bad,This was ACS at first then bought out by Xerox. It didn't get any better. This is customer phone support center. Nextel then Sprint was the account. The pre employment drug test is a joke. Dopers and felons were hired just to fill the seats. They bragged about being high and skating through the test. Qualifications were lowered as a way to be able to hire more unqualified people.
bad,Xerox is in the process of right sizing the corportion globally and thus is taking out cost primarily through strategic reductions in people. This right sizing has replaced the long term growth culture with a tactical survive at all costs culture.
bad,Too many rules with each transaction. ACS was always changing the rules or adding more rules. Very unorganized mess. Good people kept leaving while the bullies stayed. Negative workplace thanks to the bullies.
bad,"Don""t plan on making a career with this company, they are not to kind with long term employees."
bad,This company doesn't like to pay there employees maybe thats why they have the highest turn over rate in Houston.
bad,No recommendation whatsoever. Very stressful the department is run like a gulag. I was fortunate that i did contacting work but wasn't a favorable experience.
bad,"After working for Xerox, in many capacities, and for 39 years, I was moved to a company called HCL. This was done via an email, which they didn’t even get my name right. The reason I was moved, without any choice, was so that I could be laid off by HCL, most of the people who were moved there have gotten lay off emails. Xerox didn’t have the courage to do it themselves they even outsourced that. The last 5 years have been he worst, all we do is chase numbers so my manager looked good. He was so detached from the day to day business that he became totally irrelevant. Xerox cut our training, employees and support systems so they could look good on paper. I used to say I was proud to work there and felt like I was part of a family. But greed took over the company and people who spent their lives working there lost to making management look good. I think it may be to late for them and I will mourn their demise, but this was a self inflicted wound."
bad,"Poor compensation, employees have worked at the company for over 5 years without a raise or bonus.  High turnover rate with poor management.  The company has had several mergers that has contributed to the down hill rating of the company."
bad,"Pros - Good pay, some nice people."
bad,"This was a fast  paced, extremely competitive work environment.  The supervisors were generally poorly trained in management skills. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the daily changes. Also difficult was the almost mandatory overtime daily and weekends during inclement weather, illness or understaffing.Highly toxic work environment."
bad,"The environment was dirty, the air conditioning was broken. Management was horrendous as well as with sight location there was a lot of theft happening on site with nothing being done about it."
bad,Company is about stock prices not about product any longer.. Benefits were cut to below social services levels.. Knowledgeable employees were over looked and allowed to leave with valuable knowledge. Little to no compensation was set up to entice people to stay.
bad,"CEO was installed by the majority shareholder.  His loyalty is to him and NOT the company.  The current regime along with the past 2 CEO's have been miserable failures. They continued to cut new and innovative product development, instead relying solely on cutting resources to balance the P/L sheet."
bad,they could improve on everything they are immature they let people start drama and just was not for me. i chose better employment with a better pay that fit me
bad,"Typical day was taking calls for customers and setting them up with prepaid cell phone service accounts, taking payments and general customer service."
bad,"Xerox did place lots of value on their employees but now only takes care of the senior managers of the company.  They hire those who are not smart but know the art of brown noising.  Not a nice place to work.  If you like not having a family life, like working for low pay, like working long hours, like waiting for your turn to be laid off, then Xerox is the company for you."
bad,"management didn't seem to care about employees, all on site managers were directed from head office as to what the day would bring, also the head office management did not allow on site management to manage, each daily call was essentially a shouting match with jobs being threatened every day"
bad,"Horrible ! "
bad,They will constantly over bid the number of people on the phone then force people to work overtime to make up for their mistakes. They also show major favoritism. One person will get written up for something stupid and another will blatantly break the rules over and over with no repercussions.
bad,You were not paid enough to do the job and also never got your reviews for pay raises. Not many people from management understood the job enough to assist their employees with the actual job
bad,"Sadly, the culture is no longer a collaborative workplace where I feel empowered and trusted.  Due to a shift in the board room and CEO position, the structure of the company is in flux and that leaves the overwhelming majority of employees worried about loosing their jobs."
bad,Horrible place to work. They hire just about anyone who applies. This place is super ghetto. Not to mention they are located off Bissonnet so you afraid going to and leaving work.
bad,Training is not done well.The tools xerox proved is unacceptable.Communication is terrible.Told to break uncomfortable rules. Management cant help you.
bad,"Will fire people multiple times a year as that is the only way the can grow profit.  Sales reps cant sell and managers cant manage.  They offer no job security, the smallest of pay raises and have terrible benefits over all."
bad,This company is only interested in making a buck. Upper management does not care at all about the employees or what would help them complete their work better.
bad,"This place is where deeams go to quickly die. Xerox is also known as 'Conduent', so don't apply there either. I was hired as a permanent employee during open enrollment. Well, permanents earn less money than temps!!! Everyone knows this information. On top of that, we were required to do additional HR functions with no bump in pay. The managers are scary and lazy. They do nothing and are so lazy that they'll yell from their seat as opposed to getting up to talk to you. The business environment is very prison-like. No cell phones, no notes, no paperwork, no fun!!! Training was horrific. The trainer crossed out half of the training guides because the information was out of date or totally incorrect. So, the team was set up to fail. I was the last man standing. The other teammates quit on the spot!!!! My first week another employee said 'you don't know what you got yourself into working here.' She was right!"
bad,"It was a good company and i spent my 5years with xerox, but salary part it is not so good, and you can't enjoy at work place because there is no fun or any other activities like entertainments."
bad,They do not value their employees and they don't do regular reviews for pay increases! I worked there for 4-5 years before receiving a raise. They don't believe in giving chances either.
bad,Temporary contract work that sucked. Management did not have any experience and definitely did not care about customers but wanted staff working under them to care.
bad,The management is inconsistent. The calls is completely stressfull. Not enough information about the clients plans. No structure on how to handle calls.
bad,I did not like it at all. Calls were none stop and the sups were violent also didnt care about their job or us as agents. Hours constanly changed month after month.
bad,"Most people who start this job wither quit during training or dont last more than a few months. If they do make if past 6 months, then they are extremely stressed out about their work."
bad,My work include to answer call from our client when they will complaining about a machine broken which needed service or when they be requesting consumebles
bad,"Sorry, but not a good workplace. When the management wants to keep you in the building during a mandatory evacuation order and the police have to come by to threaten management with arrest to get you out, and they literally call people in on the day a fire comes behind the building knowing it's on the way.....it's not worth risking your life over this place. On top of that, the management is consistently corrupt. They play favorites and supervisors are typically power hungry. All the good ones get fired because they actually work for the agents instead of going out drinking with upper management. Would you also want to work at a place where all the OMs and supervisors leave the agents on their own without any support except one supervisor one of your busiest days? Holidays can be like that."
bad,"I would not recommend it.  It started of well, but the end was bad.  Management offered no mentorship, merit raises are not an option and favoritism runs the show.  If you are not one of the chosen, it does not matter how hard you work, it will never be enough."
bad,"When I worked here, they forced you into trainings because you had the best scores and yet had absolutely no intention of paying you for knowing more than individuals who were at a basic level."
bad,"Management isn't the best, Company doesn't care about the employees at this location. Job is stressful. Customers give more gratitude than employers do. Relies on a broken system when it comes to unsatisfied surveys."
bad,they will use you then throw you away. they are a a horrible place to work. several of my friends hated that place as well good for a place to get a quick job.
bad,"Constant verbal or physical fights"
bad,"This business has zero business ethics and their new policy allows them to treat you as if your job is solitary confinement or a concentration camp! Everyone talks about each other behind their backs and the management will speak down to you and degrade you, and make you feel stupid/worthless!!!"
bad,"Low pay, lots of stress, rich yet incompetent upper management, company profits on employee misery so if you have another job option, take it instead."
bad,"I felt used as an employee and obviously exploited for profit. There was no managerial structure that was sensible or functional. You are told of opportunity for advancement to entice you, when in actuality your department is known as the un-hireable around the rest of the campus."
bad,"Xerox adjusts your pay until you cannot make anything over minimum wage. They claim you can make more if you work more, but that is not the case. Management is also unprofessional and unskilled."
bad,"I got hired by Xerox for a third company, So all my tasks where for the third company but I worked at the xerox location. I would recommend it for when you need money fast. But this is not a job for the long term"
bad,"I resigned due to workplace violent.  The police were called on numerous occasions to this location (and I had only been there for 1 month).  There were fights, threats, and an employee who worked there was murdered (not on company grounds), and it made the news. The instructors did not enforce the dress code (preventing hoodies, leggings, short dresses) nor did they address constant disruptions in the classroom wherein employees used profanity, walked out of class, cheated on exams, and threatened the  instructor/supervisor.  Managers were not supportive of each other.  Complaints fell on death ears.  I resigned for fear of my life."
bad,"Good experience, and generally the work environment is very team orientated and helpful. Pay is pretty low, annual increases are below inflation most of the time, and majority of workers are now permanent contractors (including some very high skilled jobs). High turn over in a lot of departments, not much being done to retain quality workers. The better employees end up finding a better job a couple years in."
bad,"I've learned a lot from the health care perspective and pension background. I'm versed on specifics about how health care works and its information I'm able to store. The pension information is extremely knowledgeable since the core of the information is black and white. The most enjoyable part of my job is resolving problems and making sure that it won't happen again. The hardest part of my job is listening to the problem, then conveying that issue to the next party in lay-mans terms, so its resolved and the core of the issue is resolved."
bad,There was only 2 weeks of training. The work environment was very loud and ghetto. The people who were hired did not look professional or behave professionally. The training was not conducted in a professional manner. The only thing that I liked is the fact that I became friends with people that I am still friends with today.
bad,Not a good company to work for you feel like you are in jail not relaxed too stressful no moral have not gotten a raise in 2 years the way that they grade calls is not fair
bad,"I worked for Xerox for 6 years processing applications for public assistance in Indiana. The office I was in was rampant with favoritism and idiotic rules. They wanted doctor notes if you needed to go to the restroom. They pushed people in to getting FMLA for all sorts of issues. The only good issue was the hours, no weekends.  You could listen to music or audiobooks at your desk.."
bad,"I'll give two pluses to this job; I learned to stick something out regardless of how much it stunk, and I was able to learn from two very good managers."
bad,This was by far the most unorganized job I've ever had. I will say that it was a reflection of Xerox so much as it was a reflection on who held the contract (Kynect).
bad,At Xerox I was over worked and not taken care of. They could care less about their employees. The only benefit was the knowledge I learned during my 10+ years.
bad,They randomly RIF employees 2-3 times per month. Everyone is on edge and unsettled in a fearful and volatile environment. It was fun and energized in the past but not lately.
bad,"I relocated to a new city to be employed by Xerox. I was told one thing, then when I made the move and started working for them, It was extra things added.  I was told I was to assist Sprint Customers. But, then I later learned even if the customer is calling in to complain, they still wanted me to sell them another item. Even the elder people. It doesn't matter. What a waste."
bad,Do not work here. I was let go for missing work due to health issues. They claim...we don't take drs notes...its ridiculous. There rule is only allowed one missed day if you miss 3 your fired
bad,Not a good place to work. Their was no teamwork. No pay raise in four years. No guidance. They treat people like a number not a person. My supervisor was a great person.
bad,"This isn't a company that values you as a person, values your expertise, values your drive for success or values anything besides the bottom line.  They have hired many fresh from college ""kids"" and just beat them down to a breaking point and discarded them.  They will use you and then discard you as soon as you don't fit into what they need.  This is even the case when workers express and clearly demonstrate that they are ""Pro-Xerox"".  You will never be able to give enough, do enough, say enough to earn anything.  You will get what you get based on a random set of circumstances rather than structured development or earning it."
bad,"Its full of a bunch of 18, 19 and 20 year olds most of whom did not have prior management and were put into it by someone they know. It is more like a college dorm then an actual work place with long hours and unrealistic expectations."
bad,"Absolutely astonishingly terrible job. The management is constantly changing, constantly running around like a chicken with it's head cut with no idea what they're doing. They then take that lack of information out on you the agent. Openly racist/sexist team leads that no one does anything about. They don't care about the agents at all. They once made a poor woman sit on a trash bag covered in her own blood because they wouldn't allow her to go to the hospital. Plus bed bugs!"
bad,Hired on a co tract basis. Started at 13$/hour then dropped pay to 11$/hour. Management is in complete disarray. The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. Avoid this.company at all costs and only go as a last resort.
bad,"Paid under market value, expected to regularly work ten hours and over weekends with no overtime pay. About five managers for every employee. So much manglement."
bad,this company is very unprofessional. management is a joke ad only depends on how friendly you are and how willing you are to kiss up and tell on others. the company makes mistakes by allowing management to praise those who harm the company vs uplifting those who gets the jobs done. this place is full of drama and unprofessionalism. the sad part is that the people who are really doing their jobs are the ones who lose them.
bad,"Everything about this job leaves you feeling like a number. The jobs change and end without any notice, everyone is on edge and the feeling in the building is one of constant instability and overhanging doom. "
bad,Xerox is terrible managed. They never give bonus or raises. They do not offer professional development courses to better prepare you for the position or future positions.
bad,"The only thing worse than Sprint customers are Sprint employees.  If you think sales is full of broken promises.  The call center is worse.  Management is hostile, ignorant and unhelpful.  Some claim to have been there for 10yrs.  If you ask me the only things that churns more than the customers are the employees. Management comes to work high after smoking in the parking lot.  Was written up and the writeup was full of mispellings."
bad,"Xerox use to be one of the best companies in the world to work for. Its sad that they went down so fast, customer satisfaction is no longer a priority, management is only worried about numbers and who cheats the best, performance means nothing."
bad,"Habe bei dieser Firma vor ca. einem halben Jahr gekündigt."
bad,"The supervision needs to be better.  The employees should be paid more. The breaks are too short and by the time you get a chance to use the restroom, your break is over. You have to raise your hand just to go to the restroom. It's like being treated like a child."
bad,"Does not give raises.  "
bad,"Xerox has a supervisor that proudly expresses his dislike for women. Supervisor in this case wasn't trained to coach the agents but inappropriately calls them a derogatory name or labels them as stupid."
bad,"Poor Management from Operation Manager to the SBU Manager, needs new management. This call center needs to visit a real call center to see how it's ran."
bad,There is very little positive I can say about the working experience. The Process to get hired is overly long with mediocre training. Hired Beware!!
bad,"Colleagues are nice"
bad,"Project based position on the med D side. Got the job on the spot. Mediocre interview and the employee helping with the new hire work had a nasty attitude. Trained for nearly six weeks just to be clueless on the floor and it was extremely difficult to get help! The company did not provide enough hands on training material to be dealing with peoples Medicare benefits and prescriptions. Limited supervisors, childish floor environment, and it just felt like prison with all the high school rules. The pay rate was not worth all that the job required. No amount of money is worth dreading going to work everyday. If you value having a peace of mind, don't do it!"
bad,a typical day at the office nothing special..promotions and bonuses were hard to come by. I even waited 5 years for a salary increase.  Not a bad place to work but the salary made it hard to survive.
bad,A typical everyday was answering phone calls back to back. You got to keep a good time management and positive attitude if you want to excel in this business. Policies were a little strict. I was not to thrill about getting stuck on a call needing to go to the bathroom and not being able too. Breaks were short and hardly ever on time.
bad,This place is a joke! They tell you that you give yourself your own raise. . Wrong! Once you start making money they cut cut cut. You never get a pay raise. The company cut out holiday dinners. They pay for nothing! Even took out $15 gift cards away. Management doesn't care! This company does not care about their employees. They want to pay you bottom dollar for everything.
bad,"No tac or tecorum     the  tranning is poor    it's   not  job equipmenpt   there is no advancement,  there  the  systems  go offline  all the time  poor management they tell ypu one thing and do something  totally  different  , the state if indiana  needs to step.in and  shut them down for  waiting 180 days  to deny  claims  and not paying"
bad,"This is the worst place to work for. The pay sucks, the work environment is childish and they encourage ignorance.  VERY NON PROFESSTIONAL PLACE. I have worked there and I will pick up aluminum cans before going back.  They have a thousand phone numbers for everything and you still don't get who you needs when it comes down to getting information about your check or benefits. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE....GREEN ROAD, RALEIGH, N.C."
bad,Work there for 9 months never had so much stress in my life. Supervisors would never take sup calls we had to try to make things right with the customers. and we had to not forget to sell them something also so that the sup could get there bonus. that is all the sups cared about was to make sure you sold stuff so there bonus looked good.
bad,when i started working for Itunes the salary was 10.00 per hour with the opportunity to make additional monies by getting great reviews from clients you help. This was kind of difficult since the callers where always upset about charges being placed on there credit cards.
bad,"The place was very poorly managed.  Complete chaos.  Pay scale changed on a semi-annual basis. My hourly wage was frozen at a certain rate for nearly a year because I was getting bounced from team to team and hadn't worked with any manager long enough to get a proper evaluation and raise. It wasn't until the issue was forced with lots of long-time employees complaining that newer workers were making more per hour despite not having been there as long."
bad,Too many disenfranchised employees to be successful at any level. The lower levels of the organization are significantly underpaid and employees who are not invested do not perform well. No management training at any level of the organization which only compounds issues.
bad,"This position, to put it bluntly, entails being screamed and sworn at all day by customers who will continue calling until a representative gives in to their demands. However, if you're the one to do it; you're breaking policy and get reprimanded. Further, if you do follow the policy and the customer receives a survey and says you didn't resolve their issue, your pay is docked for doing the right thing."
bad,"Job security is very poor. Company does not supply adequate training, management needs more training-does not understand how to communicate with the different types of employees and situations that arise."
bad,"I worked here for three months, and they NEVER got my email up and running. Your email runs ALL of your programs that you need to do your job."
bad,"This company has so many cons that it would take too long to mention them all.  Most notably is the compensation, as Xerox does not believe in providing any sort of pay increases ever, even if you advance within the company.  It should also be noted that the company will never give you a raise but hire someone outside the company and pay them considerably more.  There is no opportunity for advancement save for lateral moves.  The benefits do not cover much and are expensive.  The work is always increasing.  The general climate among employees is to find work somewhere else.  Corporate executives (including the president of the company) have no problem treating employees as if they are less than people are lucky just to be there.  On one occasion we were told that we did not deserve even a cost of living adjustment and that we should take our work ethic from people overseas who do more and work for much less.  The company clearly does not want to be in the benefits administration outsourcing business and will do whatever it takes to keep money coming in from the clients while taking no steps to give any incentive to its employees.  There is no on sight hr and no real way to address issues.  Even if a call is made to the offshore hr number, nothing ever will come of it.  I would never recommend working there and neither would anyone who has in the past. The building is also filthy with thick dust constantly raining down on staff, causing many people to be sick, especially those with allergies."
bad,"Xerox has proven to be on of the worst places I have ever worked. The environment is similar to a guarded prison with walkie-talkies and intercom blast that takes away a persons right to privacy."
bad,"With Xerox you dont get a chance to grow in the business, duties were very simple on a day to day basis, no one respected management and at times it was very frustrating to deal with employees."
bad,"THey promote the people they like; There is no structure, no growth potential, and no job security;  it doesn't matter if you do your job well, if you are not part of the social paradigm you can be removed at will"
bad,"The hardest part of the job is to carry paper boxes from the loading dock to the storage without any tools to help. "
bad,"Management is lax, no interest in listening to complaints. It is impossible to meet the quotas, job starts at $10.00 hourly which drops to $9.00 after training. Recruiter will not divulge that pay will reduce to $8.00, then to $7.25 after 6 weeks. It is piece work and you will have to endure piranhas and sharks who will attempt to take as much work from you with devious intent. You will work 7 am - 5 pm on Mondays, the rest of the week is a crapshoot. Many mornings you will be sent home after working for 1 1/2 hours because there is no work to be done. There is no enjoyable part of this job. If you have any self respect, you will avoid applying for this position"
bad,"They are by far the least underpaid call center in Western WA, they do not have an option to sign out of your phone panel to use the bathroom so they make you do it on one of your two 10 minute breaks but then they ream you if you are over on said breaks at the end of the month. They severely underpay their employees, similar call center's in the area make at least $12-13 an hour, and they constantly spread rumors through production of raises that never come. I lost my voice one time because I had been sick (and they don't offer any sick days there and you're really not allowed to miss work) and literally had to scream into the phone for callers to hear me and my supervisor went to ask our ""Operations Manager"" if I could be sent home because I clearly could not do my job and he was told that I would have it count against me if I was to go home that day despite it being their fault I had no voice because I wasn't able to stay home and rest. You are expected to sit on the phone and if a customer is yelling and cursing and screaming at you, you have to take it, only a supervisor can end a call on a rude customer. People literally are just crying all the time on the floor is customer service. I knew it was bad before I went in but I had no idea. I had planned to stay a year and I've barely made it 6 months and already am desperate for other employment. Its a job if you desperately need one but just don't expect to be treated like a human being once you're out of training."
bad,"I have nothing good to say about the place.  Management is unprofessional and incompetent, pay is low, the facilities looks like a deserted industrial warehouse,  and the job responsibilities are monotonous and uninspiring."
bad,Xerox overall under pays their staff. They expect exemplary results with minimal pay. This job would be good for high school graduates.
bad,"This occupation never works on a Schedule that could possibly benefit you. The Management is absolutely horrid, they try to fire anyone for little things if they don't want them on their pod. Considering this, it puts your job security on an extreme low. If you work on advancing in the career or advance quickly others feel threatened. Which leads into them lying about anything possible to get you fired and no one investigates they just terminate people, I'm sure because they can replace anyone. Maybe not all Xerox areas aren't as bad. But I do know the Xerox in Anderson,IN is absolutely horrid."
bad,they are so unorganized. I don't recommend anyone to work there. My experience was just not the best and the people are even worse.
bad,Dead end end job with no chances for advancement. Spent a 18 months as temp without any benefits or paid time off. No raises or chance for a raise. Poor training. Much file/machine tampering and job sabotage.
bad,"I worked in the call center in Tallahassee 2073 Lake Summit East and I would never work for this company again, you are underpaid and treated like slaves. The sups care nothing about your personal life and its all business. I understand that this is a business, but you have to treat your employees with respect. They change your hours when they like and forces you to work overtime at a drop of a dime. IF YOU ARE IN TALLAHASSEE DO NOT WORK FOR THEM, PLEASE RUN!! They sound real good at first, butu after that it goes down hill. There are other Xerox's in Tallahassee that I heard was great to work at, but I will never work for this company again."
bad,"They cheat your pay you have to call HR 2 x a month to get pay fixed.  Management more concerned with throwing around balls, playing with toys,flirting and smoking all day than doing their job.  Discrimination and harassment is a daily work life here.  Bed bug infestations more than once.  The 10 commitments posted on the walls are all lies too!    Hard work will go unnoticed!"
bad,"The company culture is typical of most large national corporations.  While there is a genuine feeling of community and teamwork within divisions and facilities, it does not translate to the larger corporate entity."
bad,it was ok I answered calls talk to insurance mbrs enjoyed working and making customers happy
bad,"Xerox gets a government contract and rushed to hire and poorly train new hires. Over 100 new hires in a room with the worst trainers. Unorganized and unprepared and add unprofessional and you have Xerox training. "
bad,Site and Corporate had two different directives (right hand vs. left hand). So much was wrong with this picture that I will refrain from writing more because I think I've said enough. Nothing redeeming.
bad,A typical day at Xerox Recovery: answering calls from Attorney's and Medicaid clients.
bad,I was in a first class in SA for Sams Club project. This is the lowest paying call center In SA.  Also if your not a boss favorite you will never move around. I had a racist as a manager and people that started way after me were getting promoted. I'm glad I left and as I can still see they anymore begging for works for immediate hire still the same wack pay. Smh sad
bad,"I started out as a call center agent, advanced to Supervisor.  Management was horrible!! Supervisors and Operations Managers were sleeping with lower level employees, members of management were using and selling drugs in the workplace.  This is the worst company I ever had the misfortune to work for!"
bad,I had been with the company for over 2 years didn't get hired was still with  manpower agency.and worked really hard all customers we're happy at sait before taking my vacation for my wedding they let me go with out giving me a notice they used me till they got a person then got the agency to call me to tell me they don't need me anymore it was a really upseting experience.
bad,"Entered in daily invoices, scan and review each invoice to make sure correct and accurate."
bad,meant great people there but would never refer anyone to this company
bad,"The only people who care in my building is the GM, Tbay sups, and trainers(excluding the training managers who dont care at all). All CMS does is sit and watch people on phones, watching you by the minute, and screaming across the floor to ""check on your customer"" and eating up a storm watching you on your calls, and there are ALOT of lazy supervisors I see them sitting at their computers, eating on the production floor, ignoring the raised hands of their team chatting with the management. All they care about is someone being there to answer the phones. They are just to strict for a call center, its ridiculous. Work attire is dress down but their is so many dress code rules but no one follows them. They focus on the wrong things. They act like they are oh so professional but once you go into that building you see people who dont comb their hair, smell like they havent showered, and the break rooms smells horrid of old food. They give you this fantasy of a job when you go into the recruiters office. Agents are at the bottom of the food chain, yes they claim advancement within the work place but honestly once you get promoted you forget where you came from and act like your too good to be on the phones all day getting yelled at by customers. Allthey care about is keeping customers happy no matter how escalated they get. I was told to try and save a customers line who recently died and their family came into alot of bill and need to disconnect their line. And a SUPERVISOR told me to try and convince them to keep the line acttive because Im a smart person. word for word they told"
bad,Supervisor for Tms health. Account specialist too busy socializing with younger staff.to xare about the hard working employees. Too much favoritism with supervisor.  Very unprofessional and lacking in people skills. Would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"1. I give it a 1 star review in Job Work/Life Balance."
bad,"work days were horrible , never enough help on the floor to be able to help the agents,"
bad,Extremely stress full and management tends to not be too sympathetic with employees
bad,"this place is the worst place in Lexington Ky to work!!! this has to be ones only option. the management has no idea how to manage, promotions are given based on popularity. the professionalism is the worst I've ever seen.. This Company seems to be OK with the very high turnover, It seem the company gets great joy out of making the current employees recognize that you can be here today and gone tomorrow.. And Omg! the  work pay ratio can be compared to slavery, the calls never never stop coming and if your in after call for more than 30 secs your getting a call from ""work force"" asking you what your doing get back on the phones"" this place works for those that had never had better or don't want better."
bad,It's a job with no advance nor salary increase.  I love what I do but xerox is not what it use to be.
bad,"No salary increases since 2008. It's not about what you know but who you know. The only thing that's changed since the former ACS, is the name. Benefits have become worse, not better, bonuses taken away, and unreasonable work load. Over worked, underpaid and, extremely unappreciated. Disabled? They're going to find a ""reasonable-cause"" to terminate you. Diverse culture? Joke! Unequal pay and unequal treatment, harassing, AND, last but certainly not least, a hostile work environment."
bad,"typical day of work was non-stop calls of people who needed their cell phones fixed. lunches where spread out across teams so only two people could go at once while incoming calls where often non-stop leaving very little time for any social interaction with co-workers. as a result i hardly knew anyone when i left. "
bad,"typical day at work"
bad,"Xerox does not believe in a mutual benefit of worker and employer. Stagnant pay, Zero benefits, no upward mobility, and no raises...ever."
bad,"You miss two days, even for a funeral or for breaking an arm. Goodbye. It's sad. You can be the hardest worker there, and they will never give you a raise, they say you get holidays off, and told me I had to work Christmas day, EVEN WALMART IS OFF FOR CHRISTMAS. I was done with the job when they told me that."
bad,"No reviews of any kind, no coaching or corrective action procedures; autocratic command and control mgt., definitely not leadership.  Managers cater to clients only, not employees.  No clue about people skills.  Over promised growth opportunities and greatly under-delivered.  Very disrespectful.  "
bad,It did not take long for me to figure out that management did not know what they were doing but employees tried hard to make a difference.
bad,"I was a day one Xbox project employee.  I was so pumped about this new endevour in my life, and I even put school on hold for training.  I was told we would start at $9.50/hr for the 5 week training, then bump up to $10 with a chance of bonus.  I was also told this would be a flexible job once we ""Got more people"" because originally they hired on 100 applicants.  This led me to believe that I had the perfect job for school.  I couldn't have been more wrong!"
bad,"Can not recommend. You will never get a raise, even if you advance your position. They will tell you ""but you will gain experience"" Experience does not pay the bills in this economy. Supervisors are walking code of conduct violations and the behavior I witnessed would never be tolerated in the real working world. Perhaps the core Xerox company is better to work for but Xerox Services(formerly ACS) should be avoided at all costs. Did I mention you will never get a raise? Poor benefits that are pricey too."
bad,"This job was very low pay and very high stress. Every other customer is screaming at you because their Sprint service is horrible, their phone quit working, their bill was too high......the list goes on and on and on and on. Part of the stress was that they didn't give much training on how to explain the bill to customers so it makes sense. I think in the week of training they covered it for a whole hour. They throw you out on the floor when you don't even understand the bill yourself and expect you to explain it to an angry customer. Me and several other employees fresh out of training asked for more help and was told that we will get it as we go along. I rarely talked to a customer that was in a halfway good mood. If you are thinking of working here I would call Little Ceasars instead and see if you can hold a sign for them."
bad,"I'd have to begin by stating my account was not a standard account. That being said, I loved my job. Absolutely hated who I worked for. "
bad,"A typical work day at Xerox is like being in High school all over again. The majority of the people that work here are uneducated high school graduates. Since I have been at xerox I have learned to lie to customers. The management is terrible. Our head office manager has absolutely no idea what our job is and she continues to lie to the employees about receiving our ""ABC"" pay. The supervisors take their jobs to serious and all act like dictators. The employees were promised to receive abc pay once they got out of training. No one has received ABC pay and the project has been up and running for about a year now. The base pay for agents on phone is $9.50 which is ridiculous since they do all of the work. You get two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch. Which will be shortened if there are calls in the Que. Overall the worst experience in jobs I've ever dealt with."
bad,The Company Overall Is An Great Company But The Call Center Is Need Of Mandatory Improvement.
bad,I learned mostly about the insurance side of pharmacy and the process of which medications are approved that are not on the formulary or are of high risk to the patient. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with other professionals in the same field.
bad,"I was a project manager at this sweat shop and am so glad to be free. The parent company Xerox/ACS is doing very poorly. They expect you to work 90 hours per week for average wages. The senior ""leadership"", especially the GM is non existent. They have no communication, no vision, no nothing. They put in hiring freeze, travel freeze--just don't go work here if you want to enjoy your life. On the other hand if you are a masochist--you may have find your nirvana."
bad,Too many calls in the queue without management/supervisors assistance. Supervisors were never to be found to answer questions. Co-workers were fabulous. Nothing enjoyable about the job. The hours were terrible 12p-9p.
bad,but i am not happy with the company.
bad,Not flexible with shifts. Management does not do their job. I do not recommend this employer.
bad,Going to work was wondering if you would have a job that day. Supervisors are scared everyday if they will get fired because their team isn't performing the best. I liked helping people. However when you go above and beyond your position to help someone frustrated with the company you get in trouble expressing how the tools you have to help the customer is not sufficient.
bad,"The management staff doesn't have a clue about managing people. There isnt a set time to get off. They have been sold out to other companies several times, and things keep getting worst. No job security. Its hard to have a family working there. The mangement team doesn't like to listen to new ideas."
bad,This is a job you take if you can find absolutely nothing else. They make you fill out a welfare-to-work credit. They receive that credit from the govt after you've worked for 400 hours. Expect that they will find a reason to fire you as soon as that 400 hours is up.
bad,THe VP level management needs to be evaluated at Xerox. They have poor performing VPs making top decisions. I was very close to a SBU manager in Houston who was poorly and unfairly treated by the DVP. No one did anything about it. The President and CEO should be more activley involved with the mistreatment of employees.
bad,"A typical day consists of taking inbound calls for decent to poorly behaved customers. You have two 10 minute breaks and a thirty minute lunch which is never enough. You learn the things you need to know to throw a bandaid on the customer's problems. You'll come to find most people will just want free service that you cannot provide and your pay will be based on how happy the customer is, a recipe for diaster. Management is among some of the worst that could be hired and concerned only with not doing any work. The people in charge are some of the most hypocritical people I have ever had the displeasure of knowing. They will not facilities even the most simple of accomadations. Co-workers are mostly college kids who NEED the job and sometimes even give up going to college because they are stuck in the position Xerox puts them in. The hardest part of the job was getting anyone to help you if calls go beyond your expertise. Most enjoyable part of the job was leaving it."
bad,"I transfered with the contract from IBM to ACS (now Xerox) when IBM lost it . I was forced to take a 30% cut in pay, and went from 5 weeks of vacation time to 2. All non negotiable if I wanted the job. In all fairness the company I now work for is Xerox as ACS was purchased by Xerox so the jury is still out with them. The two years I have worked here I only now have a manager and he is TDY. He is there for show until they can find someone to take the job."
bad,"What was in 1980 a good job turned in to disaster. Started with great managers then replaced by poor ones. Petty and cheap was the rule. Check out there stock price, it reflects how they run their company."
bad,"Unprofessional, selling services that we can’t deliver on then management takes it out on employees that’s tried to help out. Then when the business fails they lay off people."
bad,"The company used to be the best to work for and now they just use their employees. People leave because the management staff only put people forward if they are part of their click. Then, whoever is left gets that person's work piled onto them. They dont refill the position that was lost because they can get away with not paying for an extra  body and work their employees to the bone. They are going u Der."
bad,I had to give refunds for google play games. People called globally with old phones that i had to repair. I had to take phone calls until midnight. If someone  called at 12:00 pm i had to take the call even if it tood 20 minutes.
bad,Drug use during works hours. Dirty environment.  Training did not prepare for the job but not the trainers fault. Boiler plate training for xerox. Not the outsourced company. Stayed almost 2 years.
bad,Binnen verschillende afdelingen is het heel hard werken en wordt je aan je lot overgelaten. Regelmatig personeelsstops en travelbans... Weinig rekening met medewerkers.
bad,entreprise instable ils te mettent a la porte a n'importe quel moment ils sont toujours en restructuration
bad,"Rhey paid you little fir what you did.  They made you work overtime without any warning.  Bonuses were lousy.  I would never work or tell anyone about this company, for a fortune 500 place they pay you slave wages."
bad,Was let go by a manager who I worked for two years yet never met. My contract had just been resigned by the customer. The customer never had a complaint against me. My Xerox manager never met with the client. In the 14 years I was with xerox only received $3.00 total in raises over the 14 years. Was let go while my husband was dying in a nursing home.
bad,"The reprographics department in a law firm was outsourced to Xerox in 2018. Through this experience I learnt that Xerox places a lot of resources into its sales teams and not enough into onboarding and change management. "
bad,"This company makes you close or open 21 cases a day meaning you need to be at a 💯%, if they don't like you they will write you up and push you to the end. I was at 103%, not good enough, keep working harder. No praises, no raises. No meetings. No one on ones. The ONLY thing good about this company is the WAH choice. Which they don't allow anymore. The literally made me go into a nervous breakdown."
bad,"Xerox has had a lot of turnover in the last decade-maybe overseas the company has a better following but in the US, not so much. I wouldn't recommend this company."
bad,"Poor management at every level.Contractors are treated very poorly and strung along by managers and released without any explanation."
bad,"I worked on several project and some were better than others."
bad,Working working with various clients provided a great opportunities to hone current skills and develop new skills. Most difficult part of the job was working in a 24/7 work environment. The best part of the job is meeting new people and developing long term relationships.
bad,"I worked here for a three month period. My trainer was childish and only cared about her appearance. The questions in the training class tests are worded in a way that will make you choose the incorrect answers. Our training class was supposed to be about a month we were only in training for a week and a half. Once you got on the floor you got yelled at if you needed a restroom break. I was let go from my position and talked down to as to why i was being let go and threatened with they would fight me if I tried to pursue unemployment benefits. To quote the manager who let me go ""if you file for unemployment Ive fought many cases and will make sure you dont win"". So in short find somewhere else to work who actually values their employees."
bad,During training you're threatened that if you dont pass tests you'll lose your job making training more stressful than it already is. Once out of training your supervisor will cuss you out for little things such as needing to use the restroom or being on a call for to long. If you're sick you are still required to work. If throwing up they give you a bucket which you have to figure out how to throw up into while not muting a call. If you call out the supervisor will call you and cuss you out again. There are weekly team meetings where the supervisor plays one of your calls and has your co workers judge how you did and tell you what they think of your calls. Must ask a year in advance for time off and still not a guarantee!  There was an ambulance at the site every day from someone who go so stressed they dropped. Never again for this company and would recommend you run far away.
bad,Xerox (fastrak) was a horrible place to work for.  I never knew who my manager was for the entire 10 months employeed by xerox.  I actually had to call texas human resources just to ask questions
bad,"I have worked for this company for over two years, and they have been miserable. The management is terrible, the job itself is terrible, and there is absolutely no support. Only good benefit is the insurance plans."
bad,"I was offered a job in xerox in Leeds ( Bldg, 3 The Blvd, Gelderd Rd, Leeds LS12 6LX) the first day I did not get a warm welcoming, and the training was horrible, as no one would help me not even the manager, they left me to sit alone and to just look at others whiles everyone got on with their own job. So I was sat there for 8.5 hour a day and I left after the 3rd day so, therefore it was like as if I had sat in one place looking at others for one day 8.5x3= 25.5 hours and I felt really uncomfortable it was like a jungle you was on your own no one is there for you. Also the wage is very low they employ people who don't know anything about IT. I was not aloud mini breaks but mangers were aloud to go for cig breaks."
bad,"Data Entry information for BlueCross/Blue Shield in an accurately manner."
bad,"Workers take 2-hour lunches usually, endless amount of breaks and have very minimal expectations. No training, it is a learn at your own pace environment."
bad,"bad pay, bad benefits, management is ok.  but the computer system needs to be seriously updated.  office is dirty and bathrooms are discusting. only nice thing was the cafetirea"
bad,"When I worked at Xerox, It was Okay. I was there for a little over a year, just a bout a year and a half and in that time i had at least 10 different supervisors. We had a ""Shift Bid"" once every 90 days and they would do a clean sweep at this time based on what your metrics were. If you had gotten too many surveys that the customer stated they hated their wireless company, you would be fired without notice. "
bad,It was a stressful job with the amount of production required. Calls were recorded and QA's were done. Clients were not always nice. I decided to move on.
bad,"Good Training. "
bad,"I would have given this a 0 if I could have. This place is one of the worst companies that I have ever worked for. I really have nothing good to say about this place at all. The training was poor, the company structure was poor, and it was a total mess."
bad,was under staffed  there was weeks that we worked every day of the week 12 hour days and not many breaks .But the people i worked with were great and the management tried their best
bad,The managers persistently drove people to mental breakdowns and several workers actually had to go to therapy for it. People were asked to sleep with supervisors for advancement.
bad,"Xerox was a very bad work environment for me. Technical support jobs are usually not too sought after, but this place was bad even considering that. Don't suggest working here"
bad,"leadership and vision are lacking for any innovation advantage. This is a data center, cheap outsourcer.  service reflects the lack of any innovation or improvements. "
bad,"The typical day was longer than 8 hours with mandatory overtime nearly every day. Christmas day was mandatory and a very busy day. Very difficult to get holidays off. Management was the worst I have ever seen in my life. All inexperienced, going against the rules set for the production floor all the time. Operations managers having relations in the parking lot with each other. There was no enjoyable part to this job."
bad,"Upper management has too high expectations, lack of respect for employees on the front lines. Immediate supervisor has atrocious people skills, fails to communicate essential information to employees that is freely given to providers and state of California, promotion of unqualified employees to supervisory positions."
bad,"It's a really poor call center job that requires overtime unless the whole site is doing poorly in which case they try to get you to leave early so they don't have to pay everyone as much, which is actually a relief because no one wants to be there unless they're supporting a family and have no choice."
bad,"Direct supervisors are for the most part nice with some exceptions. The upper management is corrupt and the work standards are obscene. The amount of stress, anxiety, and anger has sent more than one person to the hospital."
bad,"Xerox has crazy hours from the last day until the 8th of the month. This was non-negotiable and caused a lot of stress on the employees. The management team was all fairly new, and not many of them knew what to do."
bad,"Would not recommend anyone to work at this company. Does not provide the essentials to effectively perform job.  No supplies.  Employees have to buy their own pens, paper, Clorox wipes, note pads, notebooks, staples, stapler, etc.  No working printer or supply of copy paper.  Break rooms have one refrigerator and two microwaves to accommodate over 200 employees on a floor.  No additional perks, such as coffee or tea in break rooms.  Nothing to motivate employees.  Management is rude and highly unprofessional.  Company located in unsuitable working areas of the city."
bad,"I would first address the fact that every training I have attended has been completely unorganized, all over the place and quickly becomes a place you will not like to come in to (this is at ALL locations in KY) whether you LOVE working or not. If you address the issues, you will then be treated like a burden. There is no room to grow or improve in this company nor do they treat their employees like they care about them. DO NOT WORK HERE!!!!"
bad,"Instant job for people in need, but at a cost. Started on a Windstream project for 12.80 an hour on a 6 month contract with no benefits remotely available. Hours here are done on a whim based on your ranking of everyone in the project, but are actually not. Fellow agent was ranked at 33 of 177 and got her last pick in hours. Great coworkers who equally hate being treated poorly, supervisors are great but management always rides you for the wrong reason. Come up with innovative ways to get customers to do surveys and you are reprimanded for it. Does not follow ADAAA very well, does not do time off requests at all it seems. I requested a day off 3 months in advance and followed up the request 3 separate times and I had to call off on the day since no one in management even bothered to approve or deny the request. People in non-management positions are what make it barely manageable, everything else is pretty awful. At the end of the 6 month contract they can choose to keep you on, but you get dropped down to 10.50 an hour regardless of previous experience or outstanding team stats."
bad,"No matter how hard you work or how well you perform, this company won't offer an advancement path nor career plan. No training, no performance reviews, no advancement and always on a salary freeze."
bad,Managers are not understanding of employees with pre-existing conditions as well as employees who become ill. Rules are super strict and consequences are extreme. Would not recommend.
bad,"You are nothing but a number. Terrible environment and management. There's no chance to develop your career unless you have close and straight connections with the ""right people""."
bad,I wouldn't recommend working at Conduent (Xerox) unless you just really needed the money. The pay isn't enough and there is high turnover rate for people either going to work on a different project or leaving all together because they found something better. Management writes employees up for the most trivial things. You can be sent home when the calls are slow and you don't get a chance to make up the hours that you've lost.
bad,The trainers were rude. They had bad attitudes and did not do a good job training to the fullest extent. I feel as though there were times when I was either misinformed or given little information.
bad,The only thing that was redeeming about this job is the amazing coworkers. There was no stability and management was seriously lacking any idea on how to run the center.
bad,"In the past 12 years the Rochester workforce has been reduced by almost 11.000 employees.  That's about 72 people a month losing their jobs over the past 12 years....This company is struggling to stay a float - no management or direction from anyone.  Stay away from this falling stone as its about to sink  They do not pay well, the benefits are a joke for a family.  On top of the $500 cost for health care our family of 4 has a $4800 deductible.  That means before our health insurance even kicks in we have to spend close to $10k out of pocket and then it goes to 80/20.  There has been ZERO cost of living increases over the past 9 years as well."
bad,"This was a telephonic customer service job for a large telecommunications company. People aren't calling to pay compliments. I had next to no interaction with my coworkers, and the interaction with customers was mostly negative since that are calling about problems or complaints. There was so much turnover that I did not have an immediate supervisor the entire time that I worked there (post training).  I honestly believe that I could have not shown up for work and nobody would be the wiser. Most of  my duties were taking care of customer complaints about their bills, which were the costumer's fault most of the time. Some of the calls- maybe a little less than half- were troubleshooting and fixing technical issues with the customer's equipment. A true story- although I signed up for check to bank pay, none of my pay was sent electronically. After trying repeatedly to get that corrected through the on-line employee system, I went went to the payroll supervisor. Lo and behold, they had nine paychecks for me, in envelopes with my home address on them, ready to mail. Yet no one in management bothered to contact me or drop them in the mail. Having said all that, there were people there who had worked there for years, but not many."
bad,Xerox was very unclean. We had a major bed bug problem every other month. Days were long and not worth it for the pay. There would be mandatory overtime. The only thing that made this place worth while was my co-workers.
bad,"I cannot comment on Xerox as a company to work for other than to say that I would strongly discourage anyone from choosing this as a company to work for, based on my own experience over the last several years."
bad,"Customers inquiries often involve some of complaint that the customer service representative must handle in accordance with the company's guidlines and policies. Sometimes, the representatives may attempt to solve problems or at least propose some solutions."
bad,"I have not had many jobs but I have  allot of work experience. This is one of the worst jobs I've ever had. For so many reasons it's not even funny. To begin with there is no support from managers, the training is a joke they teach you one thing and then expect you to do it a different way,  the upper management is just about screwing the customer and getting the money at no cost to them. it only costs you your sanity in the end I truly hope no one will have to get a job there."
bad,"Employees were laid off simultaneously with the entire health services division on May 31, 2016. Prior to that date, the environment was hostile, unprofessional, and unethical. The company threatened to fire any employee on the spot for making one error."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of taking calls, I learned not to work for a company that has poor management and an unstable work environment. The hardest part of my job was dealing with management who thought they were above everyone else and handled themselves very unprofessionally;while at the same time, trying to figure out the daily changes that occurred with the systems and having no training on the changes made,"
bad,"poor pay"
bad,Xerox takes on many contracts and has poor management to support those contracts. Breaks don't last long enough and the work is gruling and long. I suggest it as a last resort if you know how to do mailroom or warehouse work.
bad,"Very tedious work. Nothing but issues and now solutions. Supervisors offered empty promises and were very disorganized. There were not enough seating for all employees, and some had to be sent home because there was not room for them."
bad,"The management does not support the workers at all.  You have to share headsets with tons of people and the headsets are never sanitized, which leads to illness being widespread.  People often come to work sick because, like I stated before, the management does not support the workers.  The job itself is pretty stressful because you often have irate customers that call in and yell at you for things that are not your fault.  Often times when you ask for help on issues like giving credits above your limit you are told to deny them only for the customer to sup up and get everything they wanted and more, which proves again that the management does not support the workers.  I would never, ever work at this call center ever again."
bad,I wouldn't ever recommend anyone to work for this company's location. The management makes you want to quit or get fired. I would never go back there.
bad,This job was so stressful. The pay was good but it was like a slave place.People childish like highschool. they mess up your pay. and expect for u to wait til the next pay day like its ur fault.
bad,This industry is on the decline. Xerox is trying to sell themselves as a services company but is failing.  Merger with ACS was wrong path to take.  Company is now split back into two companies.  Xerox does not value their employees.
bad,"The coworkers were great. Some teams are helpful, other are not. Very few managers were leaders. If you have another job offer take that one. Do not work for Xerox because it is very unstable and has a numerous amounts of layoffs."
bad,"Very unprofessional management and staff, very demanding and stressful, there was no room to grow within the  company."
bad,"While working with my coworkers made the job bearable, it felt like being in day care and always getting yelled at by the teacher, but receiving no redirection or disciplinary action."
bad,The overall atmosphere is completely toxic.  The upper management and supervisors all act like a bunch of attack animals that prey on all the lower level agents.  There is so much hostility in that place I wouldn't be surprised if they have been sued again by now.  They let employees bring their blankets into work so that they don't have to heat the building and then everyone gets bedbugs.  They exercise some loophole in the law that says they can cancel your breaks and lunches as long as they provide lunch but then they don't let you eat at your desk.   You will take call after call and they just crack the whip all day long without mercy.
bad,"one of the worst companies i've worked for. The team leads are very unprofessional, and are completely too faced. Around their team they will pick favorites based on how much you suck up to them, but when a higher up is around they act like how they should be acting at all times. They will never admit when they've made a mistake, especially in front of someone higher than them, they will totally throw you under the bus to save themselves. My team lead was really immature, talked about other team members when they were not around, and somehow she still has the job. Apple has no idea how horrible their contracted companies are."
bad,"I went into this role after 7 weeks of training full of hope. After 3 months on the floor and endless ""out of scope"" and ""general support"" calls my execution and feedback figures fell and I was let go. The role is promoted as ""fun"" whilst training but wait until you get on the phones - complaints handler and robot. Beware."
bad,"Let this be your last option/choice for a job. This job will leave you with no life, over worked and under paid. Management dont care about issues that may arrive in you life. You need to be at work when you are suppose to be there no matter what."
bad,"Office building was filthy."
bad,Xerox does not care about you or your needs.  Management is elitest an only wants their bonuses at all costs. They are not great at fulfilling obligations to clients or employees.  The money is the only thing that is keeping me here.
bad,"I was in a project where I made quarterly raises. The project ended unexpectedly and we were only provided a month notice when higher management knew about the project closing many months in advance. When the project finally closed, we were to either find a job with a new company or transfer within Xerox and lose our earned pay raises."
bad,"Supervisor and floor support are chosen not by their skill. there is no human interaction whatsoever with anyone with a higher position than ours. There is no room to grow. new ideas are not welcome. and is a very unhealthy, dirty environment and equipment."
bad,I was a third party representative for Verizon wireless so I took incoming calls for customers.  The Verizon part of the job wasn't bad. Co-workers were good and bad but not the best place for that. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management.  I learned how to speak with upset customers to help them calm down. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers save money on a better plan.
bad,"Worked there for 4 years for decent wage, other than that its one of the worst companies you can work for. The management is unprofessional and are incompetent. They have favorites and those can get away with anything. The rest are treated like dirt. They also seem to hire all the bottom feeders that no one else would hire, not even Walmart. Stay away if you can."
bad,"This was a temporary position. A new department at Xerox to receive calls for the 1095B tax form. The calls were few and far between which made for a long 8 hours when you only had, at the most, 6 calls per day. Call volume was not as anticipated."
bad,"The company work their employee's to the bones without a care about them."
bad,"Place of work was filthy, no support from management; Allstate should cease trying to provide roadside assistance. Often had to call 25 or more tow companies to provide assistance to stranded motorists."
bad,"offering a top of the line product at a top of the line price,should be backed up by top of the line service. hopefully with the upcoming split and Xerox removing the outsourcing services division which was never a harmonious affair, will start a turn around. on top of that a regime change should help right the ship."
bad,This company just laid off people in march 2016. Now they are hiring again but not rehiring any of the people they laid off a few months ago
bad,"High turnover, low compensation, poor work environment.  This job is for young kids.  They will hire anyone and fire you for anything they can."
bad,"Xerox doesn't care about it's employees, period. The job itself plus the awful work environment is NOT worth the pay. This job has an extremely high turnover rate for a reason."
bad,The managers get fired more than the new employees. Anytime an employee needs assistance the leaders disappear. Managers will show no effort in the workplace.
bad,"They are literally in the top 5 of the worst companies in America to work for. They will be happy to move you into a position, however will not compensate for it whatsoever. No training, no guidance, no investment in employees. It's no wonder the company has lost revenue year after year and is splitting and selling. The management or VP's job is only to please the client and the board. They could care less about anyone below them and it is very apparent. I would not recommend this company to an enemy. Sad because I do like the job and what I do however. I have screamed for change, as well as others and they are not concerned about it and it shows."
bad,"The management of Xerox in Wilsonville is organized along military lines and are very set in the Xerox way, even though the Xerox way is failing.  They have missed the boat on modern management structures and insist on a strict pyramid of command and control.  Don't work here if you have any imagination or ambition."
bad,"Been there for 6 months and it has been the worst job I have ever had. You have the higher ups who play favorite. They stand around and talk about everyone. They are very strict on adherence and attendance to the point they make it impossible. People steal lunches from the fridge. They hire people and they find out they dont have the room for them and then fire them. Very disorganized and seems like a bunch of morons run the place. The benefits you get with the job are terrible, which is surprising since you're pretty much working for Highmark. And if you have morals, it definitely wouldn't be for you because you have to constantly rip people off. They get paid by every phone call you take but you never see an extra dime for all your hard work The rules are constantly changing. There is no room for advancements. You won't ever see a raise. The place itself is filthy. Me and a lot of other coworkers have been bitten by bugs, there are layers of dust, dirt, food and hair under desks because they refuse to clean them. Never saw them clean even close to the cubicles. You could wipe your desk down and two minutes later there's a thin layer of dust over everything again. The place smells constantly due to poor cleanliness. They go through people very quickly. My starting class had 27, after six months there were 6 of us left because they treat people so poorly. Please save yourself the misery. Go somewhere else. Not one person I've worked there with (and there's been a ton with how often they come and go) could say one nice thing about the job besides that it pays the bills."
bad,"Very unprofessional environment. Poor wages, limited management, no job security or opportunities for advancement, and a culture of ineptitude."
bad,"The company tells you one thing, yet it does another. Very shady. Think they are hiding something. I was told to be flexible. Stuck working 2:30-11. I was promised by management that my hours would improve . LIES!!"
bad,"low pay, no advancement, poor equipment"
bad,"It is just high school all over. If you are in the click, you have it made.If you like to work with overweight women who think they are something else then you'll love this place.The management consists of arrogant,pompous,know it all women who couldn't get or keep any other job. They only want to hire young inexperienced kids who they can mold and form into their own way of thinking.They don't want someone who thinks for themselves or has their own option.So, if want headaches,stress, and being treated like dirt, then this is the place for you!!!!"
bad,"The whole company is pretty much a mess. If it was legal to pay us $1 they would definitely do it."
bad,enjoy the work even its hard. sometimes  pressure but i will done the work patiently. learn more with my co-worker. hardest part of my job is the 8 hours overtime but done the job well.
bad,"When Xerox gave me the job offer it stated working 8:30-5:00 with answering calls from Providers. They changed the job offer within two weeks to answering member's call. They knew this prior to our first day on the job, but kept that information to themselves. They also changed the work schedule to 8:00am- 8:00pm.  They stated we would be going through a 9 week training session and changed it to a 7 week session.  They stated they wanted detail oriented people with use of empathy and compassion to handle the member's calls.  They spelled my first name wrong and when I brought it to their attention, nothing was done about it.  Now, since I had no call center experience or Health Insurance knowledge, I thought they would help me, but most of my training class was spent on personal conversations within the classroom.  I know more about my trainer's personal life than I care to know and hardly anything about Health Insurance.  I don't have the confidence in the training to be able to handle the call center and very disappointed in the fact that when this was brought up, it was fastly dismissed. I probably should have read the reviews before attempting this job, which I STRONGLY encourage people to do."
bad,"Ok for entry level or passing time while looking for something better."
bad,"typical day is confusing ,  managers are not ready , nor the coaches ."
bad,"Horrible work experience there. The supervisor's didn't care about their employees at all. Didn't matter what type of issues you were having with your computer or co worker nothing is done. Don't work if you have kids, they will not try to work with your schedule. Nothing is done unless you contact corporate."
bad,Management doesnt seem to care about lower employees and equipment never worked. Just didnt seem to be appreciated. Very high turn over rate at this company as well.
bad,Low pay and so so benefits. No raises for years. Employees are over worked and under valued. Exec only care about their raises and bonuses and give little or no regard for employees.
bad,Would not recommend this job to anyone.....base pay is only 9.50hr and there is no room for advancement nor raises. More work but less pay and management expects employees to take the wrap for their mismanagement
bad,"It takes forever to begin training! the hours are not flexible at all! Lunches are always late so are breaks! Managers have their favorites and the other associates doesn't matter. They don't train every class the same, some classes learn more than others while other classes learn way  more."
bad,"The customer service concepts are really good.  The pay is low giving the extensive 9 weeks of training.  The bonus structure is manageable, ever changing, and could equal to a 40% pay increase minus 40% taxes.  When hired you are asked if you have open availability, what they are actually asking is on a whim your hours will change and you have no say.  You must get used to hearing the excuse ""It's the nature of the business"".  Expect to hear a lot of lies."
bad,"KP project lead failed to communicate even though constant communication from writer is expected at all times. Daily frustration from being assigned faulty laptops, lots of downtime. No feedback from project lead regarding completed tasks. Lack of respect from KP project lead towards writer: humiliating comments. No support from Xerox in handling KP. If you are looking for a job where there's no communication, you enjoy being talked down to, and project lead fails at best, this is the place for you."
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work there, I was working on the apple side and they kept changing the rules daily. No one knew what was going on. The manager was very unprofessional  and the played favorites"
bad,"For my employment with Xerox Services, I was with the Apple Care at home advisor program.  The Apple Care at home project was fairly new when I started.  The base was $9.00 to provide customer service and technical support to Apple customers.  This is pretty low to be providing support for Apple. There is Results Based Compensation (RBC) which is hit or miss it really just depends on your customers, things that affect your RBC are handle time, customer satisfaction scores.  The handle time metric was really hard to get the best of your RBC you had to get calls resolved in less than 10 minutes. One thing that always mind boggled me was a dissatisfied surveys were held against you for customers who are dissatisfied about the hold time just to reach you there is nothing you can do to control that.  Other things I disliked was the ability to get time off, when I left there was a girl having a hard time getting off so she could move. The time to be off was limited you only got so many hours usually so it could line up with your PTO. I was one of those people I did not need PTO to take time I could afford to take a little more time off than the normal person.  As far as the management team go they were mediocre for the most part. During my time there, the turnover rate was pretty high what made it worse was most people were just quitting not that they were getting fired. I made friends with many people some still there are some not. Those who are there are looking to leave. Since leaving I started working for a basic customer service job making $14.00 an hour. Those of you still stuck"
bad,"I was blatantly lied to by the recruiter about how the pay works. I wasn't the only one, my whole training class was confused about how much we were supposed to be making. To make matters worse our trainers refused to explain the pay until training was over!?!?!"
bad,I made some great friends. The first supervisor I had was amazing. She made me look forward to going to work because she made it worth while. She worked with my scheduling with the bus and the days I worked. then they supervisors changed their schedules which means they lose their team. I got another supervisor and a whole new schedule. which i could make the normal 8-hour day but you have to work a mandatory 9 hours. I talked to her numerous times about it just be brushed aside. I had got pregnant during the time with my first supervisor and when it came to the point of me actually needing to leave because I was feeling awful the management would not let me go to the ER because I had bad attendance. I went through 2 sups and 3 operation managers only to be told I had to finish out my shift. I left after 7.5 hours of extreme pain and misery I had to call out sick every day for a week and I had my son a week after the whole work situation due to my liver shutting down.
bad,"never had a good experience and will never go back. it was just horrible. the worst experience ive ever had working.management never help , nothing mattered"
bad,I was one of the only white people and one of the only people with a college degree and was treated really poorly by everyone because of that.
bad,Extremely fast paced working environment with very minimal room for error. Management needs to give credit when it is due.
bad,"This staffing agency has 0 clue what to do at any level of their organization. Let's start with the training we received. Our entire class was always behind and our instructor literally stated, ""people leave here all the time, its my job security."" This place also wrote up everyone in this class for subpar scores, completely looking over the real issue, the training. We also had to pay $25 for an email account for our own employer. In 3 months, I never used the system. Its a pump and dump machine at its finest. I took the job for a M-F and once we started, we were working 2 Saturdays a month. This company has also refused to send me my W-2, claiming they sent it to my old address, which I still get all mail forwarded from. I called them 3 weeks ago, still no return. STAY AWAY from these people."
bad,"They like to loop you in with training, but it goes down hill from there. They did not fulfill their promises of weekly team meetings, actual management does not have your back AT ALL."
bad,un travail qui ma fait avoir une belle dépression et 10 kilo en plus.
bad,They do hire just about anyone which I guess is okay cause the economy sucks especially in North Carolina. There is no job security unless you know someone. There is a lot of favoritism and that's how most people keep their jobs. The environment is like high school all over again. They should try to work with people a bit more. one of my coworkers sit and cry in pain because she needed to go to the doctor but they threaten to fire her if she missed anymore days. People have children and accidents and I wish they would be more lenient.
bad,"This is by far the worst place I ever worked. The training was great but it did not fully prepare you for some of the horrors you had to face on the phone. I've never spoke with so many self centered, rude, dumb as rocks people, who wanted a discount on ever single thing. There are probably 2-3 ""supervisors"" who never speak to the irate customers who demand to speak to one. They expect you to be done with a phone call within 7 mins, make sales and get a ""yes"". The only good thing I have to say about here is that you can take as many days off as you would like and the schedule is flexible. Also, if you post your resume on Monster, Career Builder, or another job website, all they do is send you alerts about jobs at other call centers as if you want to work in a call center all your life."
bad,"Though I am very glad to be working, this is not the best company for a season employee that has experience in corporate America. This company is a good job for fresh out of high school individuals not for the grads."
bad,"I worked 8-6. The pay was decent, however it just wasn't the place for me."
bad,"After a break out of bed bugs in the building I said goodbye."
bad,The horror stories you hear about this place are sometimes exaggerated. Most of the time not though. While working there we always seemed to struggle to keep employees. If it wasn't people not showing up because of how miserable they were it was supervisors firing them because they didnt want to deal with training them on the basic job duties. For them to complain about the lack of employees and so easily let them go was very disapointing and the reason I was terminated was for not performing my job duties while i was on vacation. To go on to explain all of the faults of this cesspool of incoherent and contradictive upper managment would just be a further waste of my time.
bad,"Avoid this place at all cost!!! They make u work long hours, even weekends. If you want.going out for a drink or family time, forget it, this place will work your butt out....low pay, and ur being watch.at all times.."
bad,"The work schedule is permanent and does not change which is an asset.  I go into work, log into my computer and proceed to take calls for 8 hours.  The customers for the most part are very pleasant and appreciative; however, there are many customers that are just out to ruin someones day, and the company does not stand behind the employees. I understand customer retention and the importance of it, but the company allows customers to speak to their employees like they are dirt.  The compensation for the treatment is far from sufficient. If someone is being unreasonable I have to wait for a supervisor to come take over the call, and more often than not, there is not enough floor support.  I have learned a lot of patience and how to operate using multiple windows and resources in a timely and efficient manner.  The management is minimal, and majority of the supervisors are in it for their own personal interests, not those they are supervising.  The job is enjoyable because of the people I work around, they are fun and enjoy my company."
bad,"Yikes! Run away. "
bad,Xerox is a company FULL of nonsense. They change rules left and right. Nothing is really consistent. The management is just terrible.
bad,"If a person being singled out is ok then this is a place to work. No organization, no set standards then this is a place for you."
bad,This is the most stressful job I have ever had in my life. I get anxiety sitting outside this place before I go in. Constantly worried about being fired. Management is not knowledgeable at all. Nothing positive to say about this job except for the set schedule. Have to clock out to go to the bathroom...ridiculous! Little room for advancement unless you're one of their favorites. Too little pay for so much work. Unfair quality scoring...goes up and down depending on who scores you.Very hard to get scheduled days off. All in all I wouldn't recommend my dog to work at this establishment.
bad,"answer phone calls and questions about blue cross and blue shield benefits , high inboumd call center"
bad,"Only work here if you have no other way to pay bills. there are no pros to speak of. you will be nothing but a low wage slave, and treated as such."
bad,"I worked for this company and the pay system is terrible. Its a piece rate pay system that most of the management can't explain and do not understand themselves. The team leads are very manipulative towards the call reps. I was on a LOA for an infection and had requested that my PTO hours be used before being placed on the LOA. My supervisor had told me she would make sure that happened. A few days later my best friend comes to my house saying that our supervisor says they can't use my PTO that I must just be on a LOA. After returning to work and speaking with upper management about the situation I was advised that my supervisor hadn't even mentioned using my PTO hours and that he could have done that. I had been promised to be able to walk the floor and help reps that were on difficult calls if I had perfect attendance for a month. I held up my end but when it came time for them to do their end they had excuses for why I wasn't able to right then but that I would and after 4 months I still was being jerked around about it. They do not accept Dr. notes for missing work. Even if you have something contagious you are required to take a LOA or be given attendance points and potentially risk your job. My grandfather had passed away and they gave me a hard time about taking the 3 days paid time off, gave me points and I had a hard time getting them to pay me for the days. I had even been offered marijuana and ecstasy from one of the supervisors."
bad,My job was sorting through medical claims and or other medical documents received through mail also my job duties included doing claims on the computer and inputting information and slicing mailroom documents to be processed
bad,"Management consistently changes schedules the very same day. Mandatory overtime is required at least one hour a day, which they at least pay for. Pay is based on customer surveys. Get ~30 seconds in between calls and 2 10-minute breaks and a 30-min unpaid lunch. Consistently rewards representatives willing to cut corners and do things in a morally-grey area. Most of the managers and workers their but the mainstay of the job is to pay as little as possible, giving the bare minimum of training possible while cracking the whip as hard as possible. There is an extremely high attrition rate due to the stress and lacking benefits. Great for  a temporary job as a stepping stone to other tech support roles or if you want to become a supervisor."
bad,"No room for advancement, low pay. I am temporary and will never get a chance to be permanent because Xerox is too cheap to hire temporary people on because they don't want to give benefits. Only 30 mins for lunches when you work 8-11 hours a day.  Starting out rate is very low, $11 an hour. Never know what time you are getting off, it could be 2:00 or 6:00. Coworkers are the only thing that keep me going to this job."
bad,Typical call center life. Worst part is that management is horrible; completely unorganized and unethical.
bad,I could not and hope to not work for Xerox again.  The culture has gone through a drastic change and there is zero loyalty towards the employees.  The employees aren't valued and the pay is that of a fast food restaurant.
bad,well at the federal way location its 3rd party in bound call center you asst customers on account issues such as tech support billing issues ordering or inquiring products. but the catch is you will be surveyed 1-4 times a day randomly from customers and the down fall if they are repeated caller or you transfer them to a diff. department or follow the company rules and the customer fails the survey if will reduce your pay. during training you get a base pay the out of training is commission lowest u can make is min. wage company says they will over turn and on your side on surveys but they don't and they will dock your pay you have to be on top of your hours and pay cause if u r missing anything and don't say nothin you get nothing they have a open door policy i suggest don't use it cause its just ruins your status in the location. there is mandatory overtime and      over time on top of that any training course you have to do on your days off as well. evening shift after 5pm in the location i suggest that new people avoid there is no help available as the day shift when management is available and supervisors on staff ignore you and its very inappropriate as well you see and hear things you would not see and hear in morning and day shift and company is aware of it. if you need a quick job to get money fast good place but its not long term as expected thats why they have such a very high turn over for those loyal and go to work every day even come in sick and do major over time if you fail a survey you are no value they rather have ppl that miss work and no call no show with
bad,"Worked on Lenovo side for 6 months. Vast majority was simple make calls, take break, solve issues. Sadly my Xerox experience is them playing at being a call center. We basically worked for Lenovo but didnt. Lots of conflicts in information from Lenovo and Xerox. Answers would changr daily. Lack of team leads. Poor upper management. Poor pay even by call center standards. No real advancement unless you want to do 3 times the work for same pay. High turnover. Convoluted rules regarding cell phones. A n@l retentive script for calls. Horrendous systems that hardly work. New systems come along and double our workload and contribute nothing else but redundancy. Rediculous red light, yellow, green for breaks and call volume. Basically, you may get lunch or break at schduled hour. I finally understood Office Space completely after this job"
bad,"Horrible job"
bad,"Bed bugs, daily threats to be terminated, lack of restrooms, poor training and team building, Ten minute breaks in a huge facility designed to be a warehouse."
bad,"After taking my two (2) weeks sick leave recommended by my doctor, providing medical certificate.  The team lead  and supervisor, started harassing me about my sick leave.  The supervisor began giving me written warnings soon after, for remedial situations that could have been dealt with by way of advise.  The team lead and the supervisor did not set the example to conduct professionalism in a office setting.  Culminating in my unjustified discharge. "
bad,I worked for this company for 7 years and now all they want to do is run this company with contractors. Do yourself a favor and move on to the next available job post with a different company! This company needs a complete management flush from the top down and until this happens you will never see a pay raise here or any opportunity for advancement. The CEO has completely managed to flush what was once a great company right down the toilet!
bad,"I started there in November 2012. I Arrived the first day and was handed an attendance agreement stating what would be punishment for tardies and absences. On the bottom of the page it stated in small print the management can deviate from the agreement at anytime. Write you up for absences when there is none, and punish how they see fit. When I questioned the trainer he stated, you will sign it or you here's the door. I signed it, immediately after he made a box full of punishments to draw out of and make people do incredibly demeaning things in front of the class if even 1 second late... which he had a timer set. I watched as he made a woman do the running man and sing. Then put her in the corner with her nose touching the wall while singing twinkle twinkle little star and allowed the whole class to make fun of her. He tried to do it to me and I refused, told him to follow the policy and write me up. He told he yet again you will do as I say or there's the door. I am so excited that a trainer who makes a dollar more an hour thinks he is so high and mighty he thinks he can tell me to do anything and demean me. I refused and eventually couldn't stand watching the people being demeaned. I reported it to HR and they said they had no idea. Which is a complete lie because my sister had a copy of the report made to HR when she turned it into the same woman for the same issues she had. They also had and still have a bedbug problem which they refuse to do anything about cause they don't want to shut production down for. They have a terrible knowledge base which is not user friendly"
bad,Enjoyed most of the people I worked with and I thoroughly enjoyed establishing great working relationships with my clients.
bad,"There weren't enough working phones for employees, supervisors were lazy and not very helpful.  Nakeiya Small, an operations manager, has a poor command if the English language, show much favoritism and is very unprofessional.  Customer service is definitely low on the totem pole.  Furthermore no assistance is given to help you reach you goals, obstacles are put in your way.  They will short your paycheck and will not verygive you the remainder until the next pay period.  A young lady in my training class didn't get paid until after the fifth week.  They wouldn't even cut her a check for the amount she was owned.  Oh and the health insurance is almost affordable."
bad,"Typical day at work would be disfuctional, hectic, and unorganized. Whike working here I've learned that you have to stay humble even when higher authorities don't know how to handle themselves. The easiest part was sympathizing with the customers that needed help. The hardest part was knowing how you would be awarded for your hard work."
bad,"Leadership manages based on crisis of the day.  This impacts the PM's ability to conduct a sufficient amount of planning effort.  No demand or prioritization of project work at the leadership level.  Although good people do work at the company, accountability lacks amongst the majority of team players."
bad,I worked for this place for about 3 years the job was easy but the management here sucks!!!!
bad,"For starters I worked 4-10's. My schedule was 11:00 to 9:30. This is what I thought at least when I picked my schedule. When I finally got onto the production floor we learned about mandatory overtime which added an extra hour to the beginning of my schedule.Which made it 10:00am-9:30pm. I told them when I started I was going back to school, and they said that's okay and can work with me. Since I was doing school on line I figured working a 10 hour shift would be hard but okay. An eleven hour shift with one half an hour lunch and three 10 minute breaks was horrible. By the time I got home at night it was 10:00-10:30. I was exhausted and wiped out that I was there like a mindless drone. The cubicles were always filthy. I didn't think it was too hard for the last person to wipe it down or for a supervisor to do so, but I guess it was. Everyone was always getting sick due to these horrible and gross conditions. The chairs were always broken and uncomfortable. They like to threaten and scare you. I had a great supervisor who tried hard to keep me as an employee but I couldn't stand working for a company that wanted me to lie to my customer's. Verizon audited my calls and didn't want me to tell people that one phone was better than another. They didn't want me to say one plan was bad and another was better. I had several final warnings. I got an attendance warning even with doctors notes due to medical problems. Even if I called in CMS would code me as a No Call No Show and that got me into a lot trouble as well. My team mates were amazing. All of them. I made some great friends"
bad,I took calls for Verizon Wireless. The job itself was great. Managers are the only down fall. They do not want to have to help. If they are forced to get up and help they are very rude.
bad,"trainers who have no clue how to teach, talked to like children, punished and humilated in front of class if you are late while in training. Very unfriendly grumpy managment, supervisors, and trainers. No one seems to be happy working there. I learned to never go back. The nly thing I enjoyed was the fellow co workers in my trianing class."
bad,"The Breakaway Group has absolutely no direction. Top level management is constantly changing direction with technology and structure without ever making decisions. In the past 7 months the company has restructured 5 times. The methodology that the company promotes externally is not followed internally. Employees are not valued--instead they are overworked--doing far less than they were promised and job security is non-existent. They let clients dictate work and timelines and the company is always playing catch up/fighting fires rather than being proactive. The C suite talk about ""living the promise"" but they don't care about the people that work there. Most employees outside of management are dissatisfied and looking for other employment opportunities."
bad,I have just started there and it looks like a out of control high school. I have never work for a place like this. Management need to do something quick. I may have to look at finding another job. People acting like they do not care but you are hiring the wrong people and expecting them to do the job and that is way they do not have to pay nobody because if the environment. Women are dressed as if they are headed to the club and the boys not men boys are sagging and looking any kind of way. Management is really not professional so if your leader is not good then your employee is not so then you have created a big messy place.
bad,"I was a customer service representative for their client - Verizon Wireless. There were 10 weeks of paid training - 6 weeks in a classroom setting, and I had WONDERFUL trainers whom I will never forget and wanted me to succeed at that job. Then 4 weeks of training in the live environment also known as ""t-bay"", and I'm not going to lie, when I first heard about T-bay as a newbie there I was scared out of my mind. They always told stories of how some people that call in can be either 1) Extremely Rude customers 2) Impatient Customers 3) Angry customers that like to escalate to a supervisor just for the fun of it. 4) The very few nice customers that made your day. Which I cherished the most. Overall, I did make a lot of friends with my coworkers there, but after training was over we all drifted apart and I barely got to see any of them when we all graduated to the production floor from T-bay. But anyway, if a customer was rude and mean, no matter how upset they made you feel, you were forced to remain calm and deal with whoever you were speaking with in a nice way. If not, you're most likely fired. The management there was poor as well, when you needed help on a call, they were just sitting there ignoring your hand being raised and talking with other fellow supervisors, or they would say ""Use your doorways and figure it out yourself."" Doorways was our ""resource"" guide for Verizon that didn't always help very well and didn't have all the answers they claimed to have. After 6pm, if you had mid shift, there were barely any floor support, and that would be the busiest time of day."
bad,"To be fair, the company I worked for was Affiliated Computer Services (ACS) and they got bought out by Xerox, so this review is more about my time when the location I worked at were still known as ACS. Like any other call center environment. My time as the second location assisting with roadside assistance for Allstate Motor Club didn't really teach me much else that could be applied to the rest of my life except better methods on how to search for locations on Google Maps. What I learned working for the first location of this company as a Sprint Customer Service Rep is to never become a Sprint customer because their service is actually horrible. Compensation at either location was too low for the amount of work demanded of you. Management never really listened to your own views and opinions. Hardest part of the job was to meet ALL goals, but trying to meet certain ones, sometimes has an impact on another. My co-workers were all normally fresh out of high school, older citizens with hardly any computer experience, and even those who were formerly in prison (depending on the offense). There were also those that were like me, been through college already or still attending, just needing something to pay the bills and had the same views about the job as I did. I had one of the managers at this company tell me ""this may not be the job for you."" I already knew that. I was never intending on making a career out of being at a call center in the first place. As for an enjoyable part of the job? There never really was one."
bad,The pay was great. The work environment was not. The job was easy to catch on to and was very enjoyable after you get the hang of it. It was overall a good place to work.
bad,"You get written up for things that are not even policy. So if they change their mind on policy, you can expect a epop notifying you of the change and expect to get written up for an event that happened prior to the epop. It really seems like they are behaving in a criminal way."
bad,There was never an opportunity to earn a raise regardless of tenure. Promotions were always decided before interviews were held. Multiple pay errors as well with all employees checks
bad,I appreciated and respected some.  Others.  Very childish and inconsiderate.  Never again.  I will never even hope to work with or in any way associated with this group.
bad,"Employees have very low morale and motivation as the Information Technology division is relocated to North Carolina, resulting in an unpleasant work environment."
bad,This is a very high stress and very little work/life balace. Workplace culture was not beneficial to employees. Did not enjoy working for this company.
bad,Even when I was promoted 2 times I never received a raise and the remote option was negotiated since the pay was the same and whenever I   overtime was offered to me from the US upper management our mexican management did not paid us a dime.
bad,This place has no regards to human empathy.  Enormously stressful.  No room for error and harassing emails all day.  They treat you as if you are a robot.
bad,This job should start you at 45k plus commission but they start 32k and cap commission very high pressured with no payback returned good luck i watched 18 people quit and then people get fired cause xerox and fuji xerox were now in a dispute the acting president or ceo at the time was just in it for him and job security is non existint. I thought this would have been a great career but dont try there unless you like bad pay and being harped on all day by management and you're clients
bad,Not the best place to work. Got stuck in the same role for years. A lot of favoritism. No raise in 5 yrs even though the job became more demanding. Excessive overtime.
bad,"Two weeks of paid training wasn't enough to actually do the job properly."
bad,Starting there the company had not gave any employee a raise in years about a good 6 or 7 years. They hire people that arent even qualified for the job but pay the new comers better but dont expect to get hired on with xerox because it doesnt happen. Things are ran very backwards. You get great workers on the floor but people in the offices just suck and dont know even the full process of the jobs that needs to be done and how to get each process step by step .
bad,"The worst management staff iv ever seen. If your one of the people in the in circle with your line supervisor or bus manager you got it made.  Goof off and half heartedly do your job and youll be fine if your one of them. But if not and you are a good worker you still get treated terribly and even laid off when cuts come around. I have seen it first hand more than a half a dozen times in the 5+ years i worked there, unqualified / poor performing employees keeping their jobs while qualified, even over qualified people get let go because they are not in the ""in"" crowd."
bad,a lot of bait and switch.  i lost my top secret clearance because they would not put me on a contract to keep it.  I thought a fortune 100 company would have no problem but i was wrong.  i would have a number of meetings with the client who love me.  Xerox/conduent management was not listening to issues when brought to there attention.  They released people without cause and forced them to conduent a lower tiered company.  The best part of the job was payday.
bad,"For the past 3 years, the culture made it seem like you could be laid off each year."
bad,Pay is min wage or close to it.  Management is not professional and are bias.   Job security is depending on your sales.  Even if you are new to the workforce.
bad,"The xerox i worked for took calls for a bank in California called Union Bank. I took escalated calls. This was the worst bank i have ever dealt with they would cut ppl cards off randomly saying it was ""at risk"" . One time they did this to one of my customers that was stuck in Europe unable to with draw money. The management is based off favorites and stuck ups not performance based at all. QA is very strict but ultimately if you sound super fake and over apologize for bad service then you get a 100"
bad,"A quick Google search should provide enough articles as to why this is one of the worst companies in America to work for. Employment practices were highly unethical, and resulted in lawsuits being filed."
bad,"If you can find any other job, dont work here the only thing good about this place is the people you meet other than that it's not worth the stress and dealing with their stupidity - seriously go anywhere else they pay you minimum wage and expect you to work whatever schedule they want you to with no regard to your personal needs even if their medical reasons"
bad,Nothing was good about working here.Management and leadership are not professional. They dont support maternity level or family matters. And they dont compensate enough for travel.
bad,"Xerox is getting smaller and smaller, poorly managed.  It is a shame as they have a lot of great employees, but decades of bad decisions have caught up with them"
bad,Xerox acquired ACS where I had work for 24 yrs. At first it seems promising. Was not log that jobs were eliminated. Direction was to move offshore. Bottom level managers were tasked to fire staff and training offshore. Then they as manages were fired
bad,Best technology company but employees are treated as expendable.  Company is under constant pressure to reduce costs and show a profit.  Actions taken to help the bottom line and not to show any appreciation to employees who interface with customer's on a daily basis.
bad,company does not value it's employees we started out as #1 when we were AFSA then dropped to not even on the list. It is now closing because of the bad performance and loing clients
bad,Being that Xerox is a big company I thought there would have been more structure and options for advancement with this company. I was wrong. This was the most unorganized company I’ve ever worked for. It could have been a local office issue but it was terrible. Management was terrible. Metrics were terrible. Options for advancement were beyond terrible.
bad,"Xerox has been long known as a hardware company its time they evolved themselves in to software company and start using the innovations that they have developed over years."
bad,"I can't speak about other buildings, but working at 216 was a nightmare. Sycophantic supervisors, lazy and arrogant managers, horrible hours that never change, problems years old that haven't been fixed, complete inefficiencies on all levels. It's embarrassing. The pay for toner operators is significantly below the national average, and don't even get me started on what they pay forklift operators. The healthcare is abysmal. Turnover is understandably high. "
bad,The other people working were often rude to customers when they called in. The person monitoring calls would constantly call your phone if you were not on a call but writing notes to finish. Management was hard to track down.
bad,most disgusting call center I have ever worked for. desks were never wiped down.  small cubicals . dont have assigned seats. shared headphones. chairs was dirty
bad,"Where to begin...the job itself as described is great!!  There are some amazing people internally. The compensation is fair (good salary, shady compensation), the benefits are weak for the cost, and they offer above average perks for discounts. "
bad,"I would not count on your management team to follow through."
bad,"Very bad Attendance policy. Un-stabe job security.. If your program ends the let you go..  No long term out look. No HR on site, No Career planning for employees."
bad,stressful work. low pay. poor employee treatment. employees are asked and required to take on extra duties without fair compensation. no work insentives or bonuses
bad,everything is unorganized a lot of favoritism I never want to go back in a job setting with no structure no class no nothing everything was wrong from coworkers to managers especially management
bad,"The Japanese had beaten Xerox at their own game building copiers that ran cleaner without developer. What killed Xerox was toner contamination of parts and fuser rollers burning up for lack of silicone solution.Plus document feed jams from cheap solenoids and shaft steel. "
bad,"Ever since Xerox purchased the printer division based in Wilsonville they have been cutting staff, it was obvious that the Wilsonville plant was not appreciated or wanted."
bad,"It had been for many years a great place to work.  During the last I would say 3 years the company started to send most jobs overseas.  The company stressed loyalty from employees and in  the long run didn't reciprocate the same loyalty to their employees. There were many people, such as myself who had 15+ years of tenure who were let go with sometimes less than a few weeks notice."
bad,"That was when it was called, Xerox. But since then, new management has taken place. So I don't know how they are. It may be better! I sure hope so! It was not favorable while I worked there."
bad,Very stressful work environment nothing is ever good enough. Constantly monitored for everything. Enjoyed processing Health Care applications but was switched to phones. Instead of giving raises created a bonus system which makes it harder to make extra money.
bad,inconsistent supervisors. great benefits if you can manage to stay long enough after all their ridiculous rules. No actual care that their employees have personal lives.
bad,So a day at Xerox consists of misdirection by management after the training environment the way you take calls and initiate their system is pointless.
bad,"Told me I couldn't do better, than I did. I worked on a daily basis with kind people, but we got nothing done. Sometimes the lack of achievement was related to low moral, other times it had to do with loosing long-term experts without a reasonable replacement. Currently, they are only impressed with off-shore talent and cost-cuttings. More than one years' long, millions spent projects were canceled and resources removed without replacement."
bad,"Calls consist of orders placed online thru Sams Club website, had to contact delivery companies, warehouse, distributors to locate online orders, make sure deliveries are on time and also works with the customers available times."
bad,It is an inbound call center for Verizon wireless. Most of the supervisors are there to get paid to hang out with other supervisors. There was always a lot of issues with management and playing favorites by higher ups.
bad,"The cox communication supervisors are lazy and angry. They do not reward competense or high performance because tbey think they will be replaced. "
bad,I've learned multitasking through more than two systems while on a call and typing. It is easy to help the member and be very respect to the member at all times.
bad,Poor management! Should really pay more just because you have to deal with the managers!! Very unprofessional. The management loved me however still didn't change how they treated people.
bad,"inbound call center ."
bad,"There is no room for growth the floor supervisors make the same pay as the csr, not a healthy work environment works on a point system 4 point accrued your fired, which mean you can never be sick or be out for your children  schedule appoints or  be stuck in traffic. It's pressure to work in a job like that ."
bad,A typical day of work would consist of a lot of tedious work. I learned from daily situations pertaining to clients as well as staff. Management was not very organized.
bad,"Seems nice up front until they hire you in then you jump around in departments and are expected to know the operation of that deparment after one day of operation in that area."
bad,"There is no room for advancement in this company, there were many people doing a job, I had just entered into, for many years making the same amount that i was."
bad,"Management will only advance you to the next level, and even make up job positions, if you run and tell her everything that others do, kiss up to her, be her friend outside of work. I have seen this manager talk so bad to people on the call floor infront of everyone. Management is bipolar, she will speak to you one day and the next few days, she will walk past you like she never knew you. There is no pay increase, the mentality is very depressing, no one likes their job, you can hear them talk and complain in the break room."
bad,"The work place is stressful and not enough help to stay successful."
bad,"Bad pay. Not easy to work with customers ans not be given the right tools to work with at all times. Rude tier2. No help from most managers or supervisors have to get help from other coworkers. No sick tome offered. Wont take docs notes. Have to take your over time pay to get for sick pay instead of using for vacation. Will get write ups for not reaching 90% of customer serveys which can be bad based on if the customer is upset at the company or phone and you done all you can and peovided best customer service. Yet end up with bad customer serveys.. Just a company that has a revolving door.. No raises.. Now they taking our pics and decorations from our sitting and its drab, stinks, bathrooms stink and always broken."
bad,xerox don't care about their employees. Management does not like to help you. Training was horrible. Management  has employee taking supervisor calls instead of them taking the calls.
bad,"This is just not a good place to work."
bad,"There are no advancement opportunities and compensation is poor. Overtime is often required, yet thankless. Only people eligible for FMLA will get medical leave. Very few chances to have a slip up. Management is often unavailable or oblivious."
bad,Xerox has been a great company to work for. Xerox allowed me to advance and grow at every opportunity. Management has always treated me with respect. Very family oriented.
bad,"Basically left on your own, especially when you had issues with the client. Talents were not know and was underutilized. transfered from another company and as soon as Xerox's commitment was reached, I was let go and two local developers were hired."
bad,"I came into this job thinking it would be a good opportunity and a chance to move up within the company, but I was wrong. When I went in for my interview I wasn't even told that it was a project based job. Which means In 6 months or less I would possibly not have a job. It wasn't until the 2nd or maybe 3rd week of training when I found this out.  Training was cool and laid back and we were all under the impression it would be the same once on the floor but once again wrong. We were on the floor 2 days and expected to be perfect. One wrong thing said you fail QA. You cant even say your name wrong or you will fail a QA. This has been a bad experience and I would not recommend anyone to work there unless it is the absolute last resort. Management is unprofessional and unorganized. They don't care about you."
bad,I worked for this company previously and it is a horrible job to work. Training does not teach you the entire job and the staff has no clue on how to run a business. I do not recommend anybody work for this company. Pay starts off at $11/hr and you do not receive any pay raises no matter how long you have been there.
bad,Company leadership consistently gets it wrong.  Unable to change rapidly and incapable of creating new growth opportunities.  Senior management did not lead by example.  Made
bad,"I've worked here for over 3 years.. I've seen people come and go, and I've seen policies change. It is by far the most ridiculous company's to work for.. they concentrate on one thing so long they dont realize that your slacking in other areas until it's being shoved down their throat. Part of running a successful business is by looking at all aspects of the business and not just partly focus. Anytime you are searching for a supervisor for assistance they are ALWAYS in some meeting. The survey system is ridiculous. Even if you hit everything they require on a call but you get a bad survey from a customer and your supervisor reviews. They have to find something in that call that would make the customer feel like we did not do our job, but based off apples standards we have hit what is required of us.. this is not a place to work.. advancement opportunities do not exist unless you do major butt kissing and your not on the head guys ""craplist"" "
bad,Xerox is a place where they use you and make you do the most for only 10 bucks ans then they pay you when they want as well as everyone is only looking out for there own job
bad,"Unless you like being yelled at all day, made to cry and stay on the phone while you are being threatened for your life and threatened to be fired when you are legitimately sick and cannot come in, I would not advise to work here. Worst experience of my life."
bad,The job was absolutely the worst job I have ever had. Completely unorganized and under managed from the top down. Health insurance program was bad and was not comprehensible from HR department. HR department has misinformation and director didn't know anything. I would not suggest this company to anyone to work.
bad,Business practices are questionable. Under paid over worked. Lack of support from upper management & no chance of promotion . I have worked with the company for two years without raises & no promotion.
bad,"Very poor management. Employees not accredited for their work. Harassing work environment. Overall, the job itself was enjoyable and interesting on a day to day basis, but management made the position not enjoyable at all. Management only focused on the negative portion of the job. Very little praise and/or credit was given to any employee"
bad,Work consisted of taking phone calls with angry customers where in most cases we couldn't support due to who we were working with. Poor staff and morale.
bad,"A typical day was filled with management talking loudly with one another near workers stations, we were responsible for calling clients and scheduling appointments for public assistance programs. Management would joke and lough loudly with one another and certain workers. Disrupting the environment and then complain that tasks were not being completed fast enough, they got bonuses based on our production. They were not understanding of family needs or unexpected illnesses. Wanted to monitor our bathroom breaks as well. Over all I would never suggest that place as an option."
bad,"A Xerox é uma empresa que tem como política interna internacional uma cultura extremamente forte que chama a atenção de quem quer trabalhar de acordo com o que é passado no treinamento e se depare com um grupo de gestores sem formação, mal preparados e com uma cultura que constantemente se choca com a cultura da empresa, de acordo com as politicas internas da empresa aqui no Brasil."
bad,"This company has no care foe their employees and their managers are very unprofessional and there id=  alot of back biting and unproffessionlism goin on over there.the job is easy but if you are rated poorlu=y by a customer for ny reason then, you are out of the door even if it had to do with the company's poor service and a customer gives you a poor scor then you will befired,the person i came across there who had worked the longest was 3 yrs and was ready to leave and looked very stressed out"
bad,New upper management did not work together and did not communicate with each other and employees. There was a very high employee turnover. I would not suggest working with the current healthcare contracts. You have to get things in writing because new upper management will lie to your face. They makeup things for to put you on corrective action just to get rid of you.
bad,Not a stable environment. Too many switches since contract work and you never know what is going to happen next with the company or your position
bad,Xerox was a high stress job working for the Verizon project. I was a customer service rep that answered phone calls from Verizon customers who had questions or concerns about there services.
bad,"I moved out from California to Texas with an offer from Xerox. I was told I would have a soft 8-5, M-F schedule. Soft schedule means that if the client once in awhile needed extra hours in a day to get something done, so be it. I agreed, and this made fine sense. The first red flag with this particular SBU should have been when they thought it was normal for me to just sit though 2 weeks of a class with no system access. I had absolutely no training whatsoever on ANY of their systems, including payroll. The only manager (my immediate boss) that made any sense, and had ANY leadership skills that was above me, got fired for some non-legitimate reasons. The boss above him liked to run things by threatening your employment if things did not improve, but with no actual goals, training, or perimeters given. I personally did grow my team and projects and did what I could with what I had (which was not much) and still got let go for ""lack of performance"". When I called the unemployment office for my interview I was not too surprised when they too were just as confused as to why I got let go. Toward the end of my tenure as an Operations Manager at the San Antonio office, the ""Drill sergeant"" wannabee manager thought it was normal and OK for me to work 12 hours days during the week, and 18 hour days on the weekends. Literally, the last weekend I worked, I worked from 8AM Friday morning to 8 PM that night, then 7AM on Saturday to 11:30 PM, and 10AM on Sunday. I then came in at 8AM Monday morning, and finished up both call centers payroll at 4:30PM, only to be let go at 5PM for ""lack of"
bad,This company seems like the perfect job in the beginning. Then they start moving you around and the next thing they do is move you out the door with no warning or notice.....
bad,The Benefits were very good. Supervisor and Management are not supportive. The company does not follow their own policies and make them up as they go along. You never know form day to day if you have a job. The director is not friendly and does not say hello when he passes you. Not impressed with Xerox
bad,"Unfortunately, new management came in and slowly but surely started hiring friends and relatives without considering hiring from within.  If you were not part of their ""family""; or the right genre; you were systematically either forced out or outright fired."
bad,"My Mom always said if you do not have anything good to say, do not say anything. And that is what I am doing. If is different for everyone, someone might have a good experience and others might not, let's leave it at that."
bad,"I worked 4 ten hour shift a week with 3 days off. A typical day at work start at 10:25 , clocking in 5 minutes early checking time clock and setting up work station to begin taking inbound calls I'd take calls for about 2 and a half hours and take my first ten minute break. Followed by another hour and a half of calls then my 30 minute lunch. After lunch follows 2 more 10 minute breaks until the end of my shift at 9pm. High volume  most times. Not a lot of support on the floor for problem solving none the less if you have a good supervisor it's just fine. Not a lot of excitement."
bad,"most people work at Xerox because it is a job, not a lot of good things to say then it is a paycheck."
bad,"I would advise against working for this company. Very little (if any) support from management. On top of high stress from the in-bound calls, management likes to threaten your job stability. They treat their employees like they're less than human."
bad,"This job was a great experience builder for the future, but the compensation is not worth the agony the job will inflict upon your soul. I was belittled by a supervisor to a degree that I had to take my break 3 hours early to cool off. The management at this facility is lacking and the employees are immature enough to even do drugs in the parking lot."
bad,"There is no consistency . No order from management down. Employees / management are all over the place, not quit understanding the direct rules, policy, and regulation of the work place."
bad,"High turn over rate at this company. They are always hiring, because so many people cant take working there. Pay is 9 per hour with incentives for sales. However it is worth noting they have a tendency to try not to pay you your incentives. They will usually come up with some kind of B.S. to keep you from getting paid extra. Calls are inbound and customers are relatively not that difficult to deal with, however most of them are upset with the quality of service that they receive. Co-workers are decent people and if you have to work here just keep a cool head and you'll be fine."
bad,"This company sends you through all the pretenses that you have a job then they tell you , you have to pass a test to actually to get the  to work on the floor. The training is too fast,& too stressful, So actually you don't really have the job. My review for this company on a scale of 1 to 10 is 0.  You can find a better place to work than here I advise you not to apply herr,"
bad,A typical day at work consist of taking anywhere from 15-40 plus calls. The goal for each day is to spend at least 400 minutes on the telephone while maintaining a pleasant report with all clients Majority of clients call with general how to questions but there are some who have unique circumstances. The hardest part of this job is maintaining RBC (results based compensation). Basically you must maintain a positive survey rating of 88% or higher to be eligible for a pay increase. They use a rolling 25 so after the 25th survey the oldest survey rolls off. It's very difficult to maintain because Apple and Xerox holds the advisor accountable for how the client feels about their iPod/iPhone ect. Management are out to get you as they only care about maintaining the contract with apple. That being said since I've been working here I've seen at least 60 people leave for one reason or another. Love CC work just not Xerox.
bad,It is hard living paycheck to paycheck. I struggle to pay my bills and can not save money. The environment is very grade schoolish. I am always borrowing money.
bad,All I can say is run. There are a few people in this office that are worth their salt but the rest are useless. They have cut 80% of the staff over the last 5 years and have not hired any more to back fill the work that continues to pile up. Then they wonder why they are losing contracts left and right.
bad,"In any business you go, there should always be a structure. A proper structure should include one general head manager, assistant managers, supports or supervisors, team leaders, and employees. If you do not have a proper structure, then the company will not thrive. Also, with training, you need to provide new employees with the correct information and as a whole, not bits and pieces. It is important to give employees all of the information especially in a call center, because you won't have time to look up any information in between calls. It is also important to receive the correct information, that way you know exactly what you are doing, and how to support the company as a whole, and to provide the best possible customer service to the customers."
bad,"A typical work day would  be long and mentally draining. It takes a lot to assist some members most of which are 65+ and don't understand the insurance they have . The saddest thing is my day is mostly spent apologizing for mistakes made by the company and the sales rep, that got the members to enroll under false pretenses , lying about what the plan offers. And if that's not the worst of it I'm sending claims back to be reprocessed all day which causes a lot of call backs that I'm responsible for making. We are suppose to be "" Member Services "" but you have to assist providers, vendors, billing departments the whole nine. And speaking of ""nine"" its not worth the $9.00 pay which consist of no short term raises or promotions. I love to help people and that's why I'm still there but its not worth the head ach at the end of the day."
bad,"There was a job posting on Snag a Job that was for customer service from Xerox. Filled out the application and next day was emailed to come in on specified day. Probably one of the 1st Red flags with a job interview process is minimal communication."
bad,"you will hate every day you work there. No OT like promised. Benefits are they but you don't make enough to pay for them. Management is poor lack of maturity, lack of management skills all together and are only focused on their pay checks."
bad,Pay is horrible. You can advance but the pay isn't worth the headache. Most treat this place like a stepping stone or a temp service.
bad,This was the most stressful jobs that I have ever worked at management was past horrible that is what made the job so hard. The customers screaming and cursing was nothing compared to the sorry excuse for management. Majority of the supervisors and OM's took the title that was given to them to the extreme and really didn't care about others feelings but their own. Certain OM's had favorite employees that received better treatment then others. Hopefully a lot has changed since I worked there and management has improved.
bad,"Do not work here. When it was ACS, the site was run by someone who would physically threaten other employees, as well as engage in shouting matches with managers, and dole out verbal abuse as well. Many, many employees have been let go from here for minor infractions. This person still works there, to my knowledge. As long as that holds true, this place is poison."
bad,This job was very challenging and you have to be ready to be talked down to and chewed out and not stand up for yourself at all and there is no support by supervisors because the supervisors they pick have only been there for about 2 months max before being offered that postion
bad,"computer systems and software does not work properly, poor employee treatment, not organized, no raise, no opportunity for advancement, limited training"
bad,"Xerox was a great place to work, but the quarterly lay-offs are getting old.  How can I considerate on a dying technology when I have to worry about being laid-off.  There time is over and they need to go away."
bad,"I have worked in the best call centers such as Amazon, but relocated and took this position with Xerox. This place was so unprofessional and did not provide quality training but had newcomers shadow employees who hated the extra work training someone. Sarcasm, laziness and a general atmosphere of folks who cared not about customer service but clocking out."
bad,"This is bad place.  No upward mobility.  Low morale, and management loves it that way.  There's bullying and harassment predominately from people approaching retirement.  Management is absent until things are going well.  Then it's time to micromanage and screw things up.  "
bad,it Good to work company. But hike and promotion process are very slow
bad,"Employer did not disclose that OT was mandatory at time of hire, due to family needs, I was not able to work the mandatory overtime."
bad,Worked with multiple systems at once while helping out students and keeping their files updated. As well as informing them of any changes to their status. The Co-workers were friendly and made work enjoyable. Management was not professional and constantly changed the way we work without even a notice to the employees. It affected the way we conducted our phone calls and other daily activities in the work place.
bad,A typical day at Xerox consist of handling inbound calls under the scrutiny of the state and on sight management. A typical day at Xerox consist of being micromanaged while working under uncomfortable conditions.
bad,"I was forced to come into overtime when I was sick, and my job was threatened after I took a couple sick days. That's all I have to say."
bad,Overall Xerox might be a good company. However I would avoid their call centers like the plague. If you are desperate try to avoid as well. They make it seem like it is a fair and equal place to work. They make promises that there is plenty of room to grow. However they place is more of a meat grinder with high turnover and poor upper management. If you want to move up in the company beware since it is done by playing favorites. You will see people move up that have no management/supervisor experience and have poor performance. The pay is very poor compared to what other call centers will pay. Will usually start at $9 per hour. Benefits are expensive and non existent. And last is that this is the only company I have ever worked for where there was no annual raise.
bad,Xerox started off great with a lot of opportunity. Then I quickly found out how they treat hard working dedicated employees.
bad,"Management skills with team leads and supervisors are horrible they are so unprofessional when it comes to handling situations. Very inconsiderate and hours of operation are bad as well . "
bad,"They just went on a firing binge. Some in management, such as supervisors and the operation managers, would wait until you put your phone into break (aux 2) then either log you out or change the aux, then write you up on a final for aux abuse.  What is funny about this, is no system is perfect.  Another supervisor had told me, that if you hit aux 2 lightly it will revert to aux 1.  I knew many people who did abuse the aux system on the phones to take extra breaks, and never had a word said to them.  "
bad,"I've worked at this company for 9 1/2 years.I enjoy my work(the people-patients) that I speak with over the phone. But, I feel that there's much work to be done to boost team spirit,moral,communication, and, long overdue pay increases.I've learned alot about different medications/conditions. The hardest part of the job is working with those who aren't people friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the patients tell me how pleasant,patient,effient,professional & kind I am to them."
bad,"training for this job is horrible, the first week u dont learn ANYTHING about the job u are doing. when u get on the floor and start taking calls the trainers are unprofessional. i had a qa person get in my face i turned to the side she was on and asked was i doing anything wrong her exact words were ""im f@#$king with you"" the pay that was promised, i never seen it...they said we would be making more than 9 and hour after training but i stayed at 9.25...the only thing i liked was the hour lunch. and then there is the drama of the employees...no one cares if your on a call they scream and talk to the point that u cant hear your customer...its just a bad place to be...i wouldnt be surprised if they are closed down"
bad,"This is a horrible company to work for. They want you to work as hard as you can with nothin in return. The pay is decent but benefits suck. They terminate employees for false reasons to fight unemployment benefits. "
bad,it's all about favoritism there with upper management lack of security lack of professionalism and lack of cleanness the place was filled with bed bugs also cockroaches and the carpet was just dirty reusable carpet all the time they never added nothing new seats were broken down it was just an ugly place to be.
bad,"Was mislead about job description, salary, schedule. The trainer and training environment were up to par however, the ""work"" environment was very unprofessional from dress code to employee behavior."
bad,"Xerox has purchased several companies and they have a variety of different jobs available throughout the country. I worked for 3 years in the Nashville, TN center which handled customer service calls for Sprint. I must say, it was an absolutely terrible environment that continued to get worse and worse. When I started there, it wasn't perfect, but you could make decent money. As time went on, they kept changing up the pay structure, kept adding on more and more mandated overtime, and I could write an entire novel on why it became such a terrible work environment. It got to a point where nobody could even understand their pay checks and NOBODY wanted to work there. They just took advantage of a poor job market and didn't care about keeping quality reps. They knew people needed jobs and had no problem increasing hours and decreasing pay. They base your pay mainly off of customer's opinions on customer satisfaction surveys. This was one of the main causes of the low morale in this center. You can do exactly as trained, you can be as nice as possible and give 100% correct information to a customer, yet, if it's not what they wanted to hear, you get low scores and then low pay. Again, I could go on all day, but I will say that it would be in your best interest to work elsewhere and only work at the Nashville, TN center if you are completely desperate"
bad,"Management is lacking, policies change like the weather. You don't get much from the job unless you are a part of the ""in"" crowd."
bad,"Fast paced environment, fellow reps available to help. Supervisors were not helpful at all ! Management ?? good question, I did not not know the chain of command. Co-workers were great, everyone under stress not knowing from day to day if they would have a job, it made for great companions. I wish some one would had told me what I was in for, it was a waste of my time and their money to train people and then no job security whatsoever. I lasted 18 mos, never worked for such a short time. I learned to be careful of jobs that have such a high turn over rate."
bad,A typical day at work was mostly long and dull.
bad,"Not a good place to be. The good things are pay and benefits, but you'll more than earn them. There are some very good people working there, but there are just as many who are unethical. They overcharge clients. They overwork associates. Not open to new ideas. Don't waste your time."
bad,"You cannot work here as it is closed, sorry. It was actually and awful job. It was not cool finding out that the federal government doesnt want to cover heart medication for a disabled adult who worked their whole lives."
bad,Hired through New York state contract for people with special needs. My job performance was very high and the work was simple data capture. For entire time there both site supervisors were not understanding  and used ableist language and attitudes when it came to meeting the communication and medical needs of employees. Eventually resigned after witnessing illegal activity involving our performance pay during an issue with the building's plumbing.
bad,The company should not have purchased a benefits structure company. Not understanding our line of business truly forced a lot of good employees to seek employment at growing companies.
bad,This company is unfair and closed minded I quit and found a better job that not only appreciates me but supports me as well.  There is nothing more to say I don't reccomend anyone with marketable skills work there.
bad,"There is no growth"
bad,"Not open to best practices. "
bad,"Duties changed regularly, often in the worst interest of the medical patients whose records we were handling. Management turnover was high and wages dropped during the 6 years I was there. Ridiculous policies (such as the 2 photo limit inside the cubicle) were created to wear on employees mental welfare. I would NOT recommend working for what was once called Xerox."
bad,"Do you hate having a soul and empathy for your fellow human? Do you just need a job that will hire you and pay you for training so you can quit in a few weeks with no moral qualms? Well, look no further because The Devil is always hiring! They need posteriors in chairs and little else. That's all anyone will ever be to them. Work there, sure, but always look for another job. Don't let them suck you in."
bad,"Racist GM who was rarely there but would show up and cause havoc. He once told the staff not to exit the building during a fire alarm. Not enough pay for leadership, which is why they all leave eventually. High attrition. Company must be unstable because they changed the company name 3 times during 4 year employment. If you exceed expectations you suddenly become suspect. Transferring was nearly impossible unless you are a GM. Worst place I ever worked and I have worked call centers for several years."
bad,So much wrong with the corprate structure of the monroe facility. In house hostility between union and temps. The temp agency that i was hired thru held my first check for 3 weeks and i had to fight to get my first check. My team lead was a bad manager and didnt know what she wanted done until it was suppose to be done an hour ago. I was hired for one department out in a diff department
bad,"Expected to work on your own time without pay by management. Working through lunch is normal as well. Meetings are also held before work hours. "
bad,Company no longer has a direction. Only concern is reducing expenses even at the cost of productivity. Job security does not exist with wave after wave of jobs being sent overseas.
bad,The work environment at Xerox is toxic now that the slash and burn approach to getting pieces ready to sell off is in place.  Weekly IRIF's have employees frightened and demotivated.  Frequent organizational changes to enable further IRIF's and cost reductions leave people confused.  People do not know when their partners in other organizations are IRIF'ed and find out mid-stream working on something where they need the support.  Morale is not good.
bad,"I have nothing good to say about the current culture at Xerox.  Therefore, I'll do just that.  I believe I was paid fairly (for the most part) for what I did.  Beyond that, the benefits are average at best but I believe most companies (except healthcare) are about equal."
bad,"The training is very intense and boring, if you fall asleep you are automatically fired!  The training however, is great.  Once you get out of the training your pay could go up or you could possibly lose pay."
bad,This is one of the most unprofessional companies I have every came across. I was harassed by a male manager on the floor I did not feel safe they removed him temporarily.  Mothers and daughter may have altercations with other that work there in the ladies bathroom. Unclean workspace and floors. I worked on several campaign successfully however no health benefits ever came.
bad,"Upper management was rude and they were micromanaging a large team. The pay was horrible, Accelerated Base Compensation is not the way to pay your staff. Essentially you never get to even breath if you want to make money there."
bad,the company will hire as needed and will let employees go very quickly.  moving most work overseas whenever possible. some jobs are offered for at home work
bad,it didnt matter what your title was we were all disrespected. Xerox wasnt the problem it was who xerox was contracted to who was the problem and in federal way that would be Verizon mobile
bad,"I now call the company 'Xeroxtanic'... yes that is s reference to the legendary ship that was called 'unsinkable'. "
bad,"Compared to back in the day it got worse and heading straight down. Absolutely no room for advancement, cannot even move to another location. Management does not consider you what so ever, all they care about is themselves."
bad,This was a great place to work from a development and personal stand point. Left with a retirement package after 26 years.  Would recommend this company to any one.
bad,"Always people come and leave Xerox because they can't sustain themselves. Xerox rarely increase salaries. Most people are underpaid and work hard day and day out. The job is stressful dealing with unhappy clients and the rewards do not compensate for the stress at job. There is little advancements in Xerox and positions change, but it seems that salaries don't compensate for the change in management."
bad,"bad culture, pay, management - avoid used to be great not anymore "
bad,this is a job where its all what you make it an Every  man for self. as long as you come to work an do your work right you are okay an will always have a job.
bad,-They consider any job move as a lateral move with no increase. They also do not do yearly raises/COLA increases. They remove positions and shift work to other roles without an increase.
bad,This company doe not pay their employees fairly while management got paid well. I was promised a raise for over a year and after being there for almost two years I still never seen the raise that I was promised.
bad,"Very stressful, they make you have to lie to your customers or threaten to take bonus away and cut your hourly pay. Not to mention everyone is high even the managers."
bad,"I started working at Xerox thinking I was doing one job but it turned completely. Management was terrible, no direction given, set up to fail. All they cared about was $$, no employee or even customer value."
bad,"Standard call center work. High queue times. The work place was always filled with people. Everyone just read out of a knowledge base. "
bad,"You are held responsible to know information that you have never been given and are frequently sent in different directions for the same question, depending on whom you had asked... not the best job for a perfectionist, as you are basically set up to fail."
bad,"On a daily bases i would take inbound calls helping customers troubleshoot their remote, box and or tv. I enjoyed customer interaction everyday but the job was unprofessional."
bad,The position felt as though it would be short lived from the start. The company was not run properly and it showed in every aspect. It was not shock that everyone was eventually laid off.
bad,There is an ethical conflict between the aims of the client company and the outsource company. There is an overall culture of alleged merit pay but the pay structure keeps changing.
bad,I love what I do.  But management is lacking.  Young and inexperienced.   NO JOB SECURITY!  I don't know how anyone retired from Xerox(Conduent) Stay project based
bad,I was very ill and instead of helping like they said they were and there for me they fired me. Would be great if they had the right management in place as well as hired the right agents.
bad,"They hire to fire and hire people who do not take the job seriously, and certain people can get away with murder. I was disrupted constantly during the training because the first instructor had a religious bias against me if you are going to go there make sure you have the mentality of a short term ride. The second instructor was amazing even she was bullied by the rachet heathens but no one is mean to advance and there is no job security."
bad,"I found myself spread thin most days. I had a lot roles but not enough time to give to all that was needed the way it needed to be done. Unfortunately, we stayed short staffed and not much feedback from the management about how to cover all the areas that needed immediate attention. "
bad,"Worked for this company for over ten years no loyalty. Mgr. has his favorites. Racists people in management. No support from Human Resources. You have to be apart of the good old boys club to move up. Management in Tulsa,OK SUCKS."
bad,I really don't have anything to say. Xerox is an unfriendly environment to work in. They no understanding and no empathy or sympathy towards individuals. Their training is ran through and unhelpful.
bad,I would like to be able to write at least something marginally positive but I'd be lying. There are a lot of reasons why Xerox and it's subsidiary Xerox Business Services LLC (soon to be Conduent) is listed as the 5th worst company to work for by the Wall St Journal.
bad,"If you're entry level, be prepared to dedicate your entire existence to Xerox. There's not much care for you, your health or livelihood. If you're trying to move up, you will be greeted with excuses, though in training the company leads you to believe otherwise."
bad,"Management is mismanaged, high turn overrate. High pace environment. But turn over rate is so high easy chance for advancement. Low pay rates for the amount of work that is asked of you."
bad,Picked the mail up from the post office. Sorted mail and delivered every day (Monday-Friday) to every office. Had no help from other co workers. Other people would try to sort the mail and ended up putting mail and packages in the wrong locations and it caused mail and package to get lost. Told the other employees to put the mail and packages in a stack on my desk and I would sort it out so it would get to the correct locations but they never listened and did their own thing and I would get the blame for everything if something got lost or not delivered on time.
bad,"I met some amazing people during the time that I was employed. We put up with some messed up stuff at this location. When I signed on as tech support I was told the turn around was very low. Now they are terminating people for there numbers. We are surveyed on the customers opinion about what the company can do for them. Like any company we have good and bad days. However agents can only do what the company allows them to do. If we have no access then we cannot please the customer. We get blamed for sales store agents lying to customer and customer care chat has to clean up the mess. Verizon wireless is an evil company. Working for the contact center was a joke it is not a career, it's a pit stop! They may pay well and the people you meet are awesome however the director Jack kozney and operations manager BRittany Lem are unprofessional, and have no idea what they are doing nor do they know how to respect there employees or run a company. All this place cares about is reviewing the numbers but not reviewing the chat. This place is a joke and will loose the contract. There is already a lawsuit in place aginst this company because of how dirty they are. They write you up for numbers and then do not give you adequate help or coaching or even time to be in the 92% people are afraid to loose there jobs and no one should feel that way. I was openly threaded on the floor that I would be terminated if I didn't bring up my numbers. I went on vacation and came back had one bad day and was let go the next day without my paycheck at time of termination. I was also told that a final write"
bad,"things we always changing, they cheated people out of their money and they will fire you based off personal interest.they are not a company i recomed"
bad,"This has been the worst job I have ever had, upper management lacks empathy and expects you to work like a robot. There is such a negativity in the work place there is low morale. There is a lack of professionalism and there is just a lack of care overall. People aren't excited about what they do and will take any opportunity to go work somewhere else."
bad,Enjoyed being able to assist customers through building personal connection on every call. Loved being able to use my knowledge and skill to benefit customers needs.
bad,"All who apply here, beware. The location in Castleton, Indiana (because I don't know if it's the same at all locations) is nothing but a soul-sucking, energy draining money hungry, big boss corporation that cares little for it's employees or anything else besides being able to pay the bills and fill their pockets. "
bad,"If you're a call center operator, you will take back to back phone calls for eight hours a day. It can be very mentally exhausting. This is not bad enough to give up on the job, but everything else is. You will not be allowed to use the bathroom except on your break, much like prison. You will be constantly threatened with write-ups and job loss if you don't do everything perfectly, and you won't, because the system they have in place is horribly flawed. Co-workers above you who are supposed to help/mentor you, are just rude and lie to you, making you do wrong things, which lead to more bad statistics. They will probably not teach you anything before you get on the phones, either, so you will feel like a complete idiot talking to customers. Most of the managers are borderline useless and lie constantly. You will work every holiday. They took away things like sick days and vacation time while I was there, which was the last straw for me. A job that won't even give you a week off once a year is more like an abusive relationship than a job. It's just not sustainable."
bad,"Management doesn't have clear directions, high employee turn over, poor compensation/benefits, poor advancement, poor company culture, offer flexible hours/telecommuting."
bad,"Rules cahnge everyday, managment  treat workers like they are in grade school , taking away15 min  breaks and giving you 10 when peolple dont adhere to there schedule. 30 Minute lunches no bathroom breaks in between break one and lunch and break two, poor pay for all the work we do ."
bad,"Training is great, but once that is over, you're thrown to the wolves. You're supervisor does not care about you or what you're there to do. A lot of the time they would sit there on their phones and wouldn't help you if you needed it. Meanwhile, the employees were not allowed to have their phones ON, much less using them. We could use them in the break room or outside, but that is it; not even in the bathroom! They would also refuse to take Supervisor calls, even if the customer insisted they speak to one."
bad,I would not recommend a job no oppurtunity to advance with the company. My experience with the company is that they ned to train more properly and be more persistent in company policies
bad,"It's a hard place to work at, the managers demand too much, and you get screamed at all day. /// For a 7.5 hourly job it really didn't have much to offer. I will say that the benefits provided by Humana were excellent but not enough."
bad,Very active work place and not a fun place to work because no supportive manager are supervisor or leader. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my co-worker.
bad,"Needs better management ,there is absolutely no job security 10 years of service , Csr get no respect and actually generate most of the work , no flexibility at all and most of the workers are unhappy however the compensation is grate I wish they treated there employees better and had a more flexible schedule overall the money is good things could be better"
bad,"A typical day at Xerox is like sitting at your system and do the same tasks every time and as a fresher a person needs to do it for the whole year,no new thing gets to know.As far as learning is concerned you are on your own, little bit of help will get from good people but not from everyone.And Management is the worst they don't know what you are doing and reviewing process is very bad.The hardest part of the job in xerox is that , you don't get to know what you are doing according to your profile.Only enjoyable part in xerox is that they have table tennis table's to play."
bad,"Motivated individual with demonstrated proficiency in listening to customer's needs and formulating the tactical action plan to achieve results. Constantly explores opportunities to further elevate my current customer service and computer skills as well as acquire new skills and provide an opportunity for advancement. Superior interpersonal dynamics interface seamlessly with others from all levels, backgrounds, and cultures. Respected for maintaining a professional demeanor, regardless of the situation."
bad,"NO a good experience. Pay is ok , you do not need to have a degree or bachelor in order to work for them in the call center, however if you are a professional this is NOT where you want to work."
bad,"Very poor management. No benefits, poor pay. Employee conflicts have poor out comes. Lack of customer service. In general very few employees care nor excel. They merely do enough to get by."
bad,"This place is a Stress Machine were  you're possibly can have a nervous break down, heart attack, stroke anything that will be bad on your health!"
bad,this place doesn't know what they are doing and they are always changing and expect the employees to just start taking on new duties with no advance in pay or anything.. by far on the worst companies I have worked since I've starting working in Colorado. would recommend this job to my worst enemy..
bad,I have learnt a lot in my career her at Xerox. In really enjoy what I do. I have great co workers. A typical day at work involves a lot of work but I have absolutely no complaints.
bad,"It used to be a fun place to work and had I had some great co-workers. A huge downside is the upper management - no raises, or chance for advancement and then with little warning they layoff or outsource employees while giving raises to the upper management."
bad,"This site can be very frustrating. Your after call surveys can lower your pay to minimum wage, even though you can be up to 13$ hr/ when I was there. That's not even the worst part. They can dispute surveys, but if Verizon Wireless did not accept it for ANY small reason you would be forced to have less pay. Some reason they would refuse to dispute surveys could be small like a simple sentence of your closing you missed or if the person who took your survey had a problem that they did not even tell you about and later remembered. I was very good at this site and maintained the top 10% for the majority of my employment. When I was promoted to a Training Supervisor I had 20 agents to monitor and ensure they meet graduation requirements. Sometimes, I would have to micromanage an agent who was not meant for Call Center work in order to find a reason to fire them. I would have managers tell me to get rid of someone ASAP but they would require me to put them on a corrective path first. I wanted to be able to work with each person to figure out what works for them and help them succeed. Instead I spent all my time as a supervisor trying to fire individuals that MGMT did not like."
bad,"The management didn't care"
bad,"At this job I was excited at the beginning. My trainer was fun and made our training class fun and easy to look forward to. During training we made $10 an hour. That wasn't an issue. We were told that we'd be making $12 an hour when we hit the floor. That was a lie. There is this thing they call RBC which is sort of like commission for good survey's. Just getting on the phones after training I expected to have a little difficulty making the RBC at first because I was new. A month into being on the phones they changed the requirements. How convenient. Instead of getting an 88 percent you now had to get a 92 percent. Which almost no one gets. They change rules there on a regular basis and it truly creates frustration. They wonder why they have to hire people on a regular basis, but don't realize that they are the problem. They need better management and to gain stability. Because if they keep it up, I'm pretty sure apple will need to pull there contract."
bad,"Xerox is a decent place to work at.  Honestly you get full time work and decent pay, but it all breaks down to which project your placed on.  Recently it seems like the company has been getting a lot stricter.  If your starting off Xerox is a great place to work but you have to honestly have the mind set for it."
bad,Too much stress and your only guide is procedure documents which are vaguly written. I had to take medication after i started working here
bad,"Very low pay for call center, strict empty desk policy, uneducated and imature management, unruly customers, poor training course,  little to no job security if you are uneducated and make a mistake, having to provide a service knowing it's the most expensive with the worst deals, very strict time management policy, computer systems constantly crashing, no down time whatsoever. Bad job for those with problems with anxiety, never know what kind of customer is coming next or what will happen."
bad,Environment was not all that.  A lot of favoritism was flaunted and those favorite people were promoted. People that had positions for a while were demoted and the new people coming in that didn't have experience or knowledge of what was really necessary were giving positions they couldn't answer questions for.  If you weren't liked you were ignored or blown off.  It was a call center.  The atmosphere wasn't pleasant.
bad,"This position is a stressful work environment with management ruled by the whims and will of outside clients who don't really care about their customers further than the next dollar that they make. They took away something valuable on your lunch break on paydays to make sure that you came back to make calls. They would buy lunch for your only to have you stuffing it down your throat in between phone calls, because the lunch was an incentive to get you to work through your lunch. Hiring less people to manage a larger load clearly benefited the company our project was working for but it was clear that the customer's were suffering. "
bad,"In Q4 CY2013, Xerox/ACS shipped only two (2) servers of the ~160 servers promised to the 31 Tx state agencies serviced under the present contract. In Q1 CY2014, Xerox/ACS fired the program director, relieved the lead account manager, and the PMO director quit. As of the beginning of Q2 CY2014, the entire program was being run by a glorified HR manager who was also crediting herself with account manager responsibilities."
bad,"The work place is ALWAYS dirty. "
bad,"I began working at Xerox in Bolingbrook, Il in November 2013. The training class was by far the most unprofessional. Everyone is giving you info that is either outdated or just plain wrong. Not to mention the unfair quality rating, is so subjective and basically depends on who is listening and the mood they are in.  Getting PTO is like pulling teeth the system they have in place is so unfair! Not to mention the dresscode or lack there of. Thank God I'm putting in my notice tomorrow."
bad,"If you enjoy providing excellent customer service, working with the general public and making a living while doing so then run far, far away from this employer.  Management is a constantly changing enigma without purpose or direction.  The pay scale is so convoluted that you should treat this job as $11.00 per hour...if you're lucky.  They keep a ""rolling 30"" schedule on your survey's; so you could have 29 perfect scores and the one customer who decides to be a donkey and fail you in a survey will bump you down in pay for (2) weeks.  I had an instance where the customer pressed the wrong button and entered a ""1"" instead of ""10"" and was told that the failing score would still affect my pay (the customer even left a ""verbatim"" to explain the mistake)."
bad,This company offered unlimited overtime while I was employed and the money was great but the jobsite itself not so much.
bad,Working at xerox was fun at first until they said we would be paid 10.00 an hour after training and that never happened there was so many changes for the worst after I had left I had heard that so many people had left because of the lies and changes other than the lies and changes the co-workers were great and fun to be around.
bad,Xerox offers no raises to its employees and just gives you more and more work with no room for advancement
bad,"I liked my actual job that I performed, but the environment was pretty bad, and there was no opportunity for advancement."
bad,"No raises-Policy"
bad,"I've been working here 6 years and received little to no recognition in terms of salary, bonus, or proper title.  I have a lower title but do the same work as my colleagues in higher titles.  I discuss titles because no one gets bonuses, salary increases or any other incentive.  The only perk of this job is balancing work/life."
bad,"This company is by far the worst establishment ever.   The employees were a pleasure to work with. On the other hand, the management was horrible.   I would rate the professionalism in this company below zero.  The supervisors needs more training on how to supervise and maintain the confidentiality of the employees.  Only management is approved for time off.  The systems don't work to assist customers properly.  They want you to come in early w/o pay to sign on  because it takes so long for the systems to load up.  Several of the supervisors are very lazy. They sit at their desks on their phones or with their faces in the computers all day.  When it comes to using the washroom outside of breaks, look forward to a coaching.  The manager is clueless to anything that pertains to the system applications and customer's accounts. Their favorite saying was ""Call help desk"" when customer's requested a supervisor.  Only one shift was on mandatory overtime. I could go on and on about this company. How could you meet metrics and the systems are either slow, running very poorly, or completely down...."
bad,"poor management. great pay"
bad,"xerox used to be acs this is the worst job i would only reconmmed for someone with no other options which is how i ended up there. the upper management has no regard for employees that dont care what happens to you, you can have a heart attack on the floor go to the hospital and they will stick hit your absentiesim to take your money. you get 9 an hour but can make up to 14.50 which they will find any way to make sure you dont with the surveys and the outrageous expectations dont ever expect any appreciation becase you will not get it. we do customer service for sprint and to be honest the guidelines sprint have for us its clear they could careless about their customers they have a scenario and the anser for everythi is no im just saying this job is someplace you get stuck in becase you have no time or energy to find anythin else once you get sucked in take my advice find simething better. oh and by the way they are open 365 days a year the only way you will get a holiday off is if its your off day dont bother trying to put in pto either they will deny it for sure"
bad,This job was a terrible.I would never return. It was unprofessional and the work environment was unpleasant
bad,Unfortunately we had a fraud issue in the department. We had our manager down the hall who should've been present in the room. This resulted to all of us including the manager losing our jobs.
bad,"As far as rules and policies, this was a very militant, unforgiving and rigid place to work for. They had more rules to fire you than keep you like most companies these days except they were worse."
bad,Worked with customers and internal customers.
bad,I worked at a location that was shut down and there is a reason it was. I enjoyed who I worked with but not so much what I did. This job focuses mostly on the work and not on the worker as a person
bad,Company is going downhill FAST. Top executives no longer care about the employees some of which have dedicated their work lives to this company all for it to be taken away in a heartbeat.
bad,"Call center tech support, after 3 years of terrible managing, the contract was pulled by the other company."
bad,Xerox was all about money for themself they didn't really take care of their employees. No advancements. No raises and perks for their employees. I didn't like it but needed a job.
bad,It was not as professional as I would have liked. The pay rate was not at a great comprensation rate to live off of. And the health benefits were suitable for a family or individual.
bad,"uring a typical work week, one of my biggest tasks is checking in on my staff and assessing their progress on various projects. I like to meet first thing on Monday to discuss our priorities for the week, then meet again in the middle of the week to check progress, and meet once at the end of the week to discuss goal setting for the next week"
bad,make sure that you are on your p's and q's. some of the management was not willing to listen or take into consideration the employees input on some issues or concerns
bad,"When I first started at Xerox, I thought it would be the perfect place to work given my experience but that quickly changed after some personal matters arose. I do not plan to ever work for them again!"
bad,"Other employees in my training class and I were told no future raises whatsoever at the client's request; therefore, permanently making $10 per hour.  "
bad,"The center in the town that I worked was there for a bit, this is before poor management got the center closed and close to 300 people lost their jobs."
bad,Terrible office culture. Older employees ran the office despite management. If they decided they did not like you then your job life became insufferable. Would make false accusations to HR and then bully direct management into going along with it. Terrible terrible work environment.
bad,"Midas PLUS dept."
bad,Toxic work environment with toxic work hours; toxic coworkers with toxic customers. Pay raises scaled on things out of the immediate control of the workers.
bad,I was in WFM and honestly the best part about the job was my direct boss. Supervisors were lazy and just played on their phones all day. The site is closed now because they lost the contract.
bad,It was like all other call center with different customer all over the US. but I worked with UK people. they were paying fairly but needs to work on Management and training more.
bad,Management was constantly changing.  Management decisions did not follow agreed upon Scope of work.  Long work hours (days and Nights).Everyone was constantly worried about losing their job.
bad,The Company's goal is to move all  jobs over to Guatemala. They have sold off the productive parts of the company. The Rebuilding is not in the USA sites but in low paying countries.
bad,The job was horrible. There was only opportunity for career advancement if you had an outside personal relationship with upper management. It was like being in a cult working there.
bad,"Xerox leadership and management is cutthroat and ruthless.  Sadly, many good, knowledgeable people have left causing confusion on how to navigate the internal (older) systems of Xerox"
bad,Xerox should only be an option if you are down to your last resort. the environment is not clean. the staff is unprofessional and your concerns are never acknowledge
bad,Leadership are unqualified and unprofessional. The locations are dirty and most employees are aggressive and often fight and argue in common areas of the building.
bad,It was a job that had no room for advancement and the benefits weren't the greatest. Management needs to improve. The co workers were enjoyable to work with.
bad,"Horrible benefits, management allows illegal and abusive behavior, HR tolerates harassment, age and gender discrimination and does nothing to correct it or protect employees."
bad,"Xerox, particulary Fastrak acct,does not look into the skills of an employee. They may assign a competitive employee to a much bigger role but will not  be subject for promotion."
bad,"I have Never work with a company with such lack of loyalty in my Life! Very cold, uncaring of employees and very negative."
bad,"If you're desperate for money and need a job right away, then go here. Otherwise, if you have worked hard at any job you've had, DO NOT go here.  You get ZERO recognition."
bad,The company made changes every hour it seam it was really annoying. I know company make changes but not every single day that was crazy. .
bad,"Lack of training, lack of help, lack of knowledge provided from management. Waste of time, anyone who has quit there knows it and would never go back."
bad,"Xerox does phone support for U.S. Cellular and Apple. I worked there for about a month. Training is the absolute worst I've ever had, especially for what you're expected to do. The trainers don't have it together, and rarely start the daily training on schedule. Most of my fellow trainees were sitting there on their cell phones, killing time. Very little productive training time. "
bad,This place does not have the ability to give raises. The company is based in Connecticut and if u have questionable credit this company will allow garnishments even when the state employee works prohibits check garnishing.
bad,"Work was all about handling EBT and Child support cards. The training was decent. The salary for a bilingual was below industry standard and no opportunity for growth for bilingual. Spanish calls take longer than English calls, and when you're measuring the length of your call and get paid according to that it is disheartening, especially when they promise you a steady salary when you interviewed then they switch it. The best part of working there was my last manager, he was fair with me and always very helpful. The system,equipment,office furniture, and facility was below industry standards. Long distance to drive for the salary i was receiving. Half an hour for lunch, inadequate break room."
bad,"Promoted swiftly within the company, because of excellent interpersonal skills-good communicator, leadership skills. Relocated to Indianapolis to train on new benefits system. Managed front desk of high volume Indianapolis FSSA benefits office."
bad,"The people I worked with at this location are good people. Leadership is not so good. Or at least certain elements of leadership. Being a union employee at the time, Xerox is very anti-union and did everything they could to try to get union employees to quit or get fired."
bad,"""DON'T APPLY"" Xerox is one of the worst companies to work for. Management DON'T care about the employees. The benefits/insurance is ok. That's about it. I dread going to work. All the mangers are unfair. The pick and choose who they want to schedule off. You almost have to beg for a day off, don't get sick and have to be schedule off more than three days. You will be looking for a new job."
bad,"Not a difficult job, but the training leaves one feeling vastly unprepared, accountability is minimal, one's job is constantly threatened for anything possible (including not fitting all of the suggested phrases into a call to fill dead air, not closing a call properly, etc.), many of the supervisors are incompetent, many of the demands on the staff are not possible to complete in a single working day so the salaried workers frequently stay hours after their shift trying to catch up, promises are constantly made and never kept, and people playing favorites is one of the few things you can count on to help you keep your job. Not to mention everything for advancement is based off one's scores and anything less than perfect every month results in a write-up. Results are easily forged and the agents who have to clean up after the people who promised everything with no delivery take all of the negative scores. No backup when the customers are verbally abusive or harassing one sexually."
bad,Management expected way to much for new employees who have only been on the floor for two weeks. Poor to no support from management at all.
bad,"Job duties would change frequently as well as shifts with very short or no notice. Not a good environment to work in. A lot of very noticeable favoritism that would create conflict within co-workers.  Management was bad, in several occasions when presenting a concern or complaint I was given the run around and issue was never resolved. I did not like working there at all."
bad,This was the worst company I have ever worked for. They are extremely nice when you start working for them and you think you have a secure job. But 90 days later they tell you your production isn't up to speed or standards and say they gave you 3 warnings then fire you. This company cares more about speed then quality and you are not treated very well by the boss. When fired he won't even answer your questions or look you in the eye. After I was fired the very next day they had an ad on here for my position but for lower part.Hands down worst job I  ever worked at and most disrespectful management!!
bad,"Don't rely on any pay raise, $12.00hr. Great co-workers, stressful environment, hostile management."
bad,The job itself was easy. Management made the job very difficult with the micromanagement and unrealistic expectations.
bad,I love this company because when I got selected in Xerox Company then I found my self very happy because it was nice company.
bad,"Incoming call-center, customer service for Verizon Wireless customer. I learned about troubleshooting cell phone issues, and how to explain billing statement to customers. Most of my coworkers were great. We were a diverse group. The most difficult part of this job is dealing with angry, disgruntled customers who just want someone to yell at. More training and mentoring is needed for some employees. I was left floundering most of the time to try and help customers. I met a lot of nice people/coworkers and when I could assist customers, it was rewarding."
bad,"I just hate that job. You are watched like a fish in a fish bowl. Also its a call center, those suck anyway. They pay okay but I'd rather get paid less than have to work years there."
bad,"there is no support. the training is horrible. be ready to learn on your own. The customers truly hate the pre-paid department. they work you too death; this is good if you love the constant over time. they will do everything they can to screw you out of holiday pay, that they force you too work, even if your scheduled off. "
bad,"Most employees telecommute"
bad,"This company's management is real bad...and the way they go through employees Im not surprised they are looking for more all the time. I was in their words ""separated from employment from this company for reasons that werent my fault, because there was no floor lead to ask a question to...and no employees that were qualified to answer my questions, at the time. Then they tried to make it so I couldnt receive unemployment, which didnt work, because Im not the kind of employee that woud try deliberately try to ruin a company. They had other employees that were stealing things, which I couldnt believe....That being said I loved the job, but the management and some of the other employees they hired, couldnt be trusted. Not the kind of place I wanted to work."
bad,The only way to get a raise is to leave and come back.  Management has not been trained to manage people.  They manage by fear.
bad,"I loved the ppl I worked with very friendly, management on the other hand was minimal at times horrific training was non-existent with high expectations. I was never given the proper training that was promised and my department was left to fend for ourselves because no one really wanted to deal with our work load or oversee our work on a regular basis till a issue came up. Management was very poor on getting information about issues before  discussing problems also never took ownership of any miscommunication or lack of with our dept"
bad,No matter what i tried to do they would not give me the days i needed off for religion reasons.
bad,"this is one of the worse places I have worked for, its a very stressful job you are over worked and under paid. I enjoy my peers and the people that work for me but besides that the job sucks"
bad,"If you have a busy life, children, or any personal issues that are going on in your life this is not the job for you. You are not allowed to miss more than one day of work or you are automatically terminated. Choose as you will but my training class alone lost 10 people within a month because of poor management and working skills."
bad,I have work there for over a year. I was happy until the company started to do budget cuts. The agents at my site have all been affected by a new pay system which only pays the most of $2.12 per call with a aht average of 10 min per call. How ever they do offer a good source of job security if you follow the rules.
bad,"I gave them 28 years of service.  The first years it was all about the customers.  They cared about employees and customers.  Afterwards, it was a steady decline and now they don't care about neither their employees nor their customers. They want customers money, but don't want to put money into the customers equipment yet, they expect you to meet their targets."
bad,"Xerox has been a great place to work, however the company is a shadow of its former self, outsourcing most roles to cheaper resources, this has left the remaining staff overworked and lacking any clear direction, in a dying industry. My time here is done. No growth here and salaries are falling way behind the norm."
bad,"The company has been keeping yearly earnings flat for two decades by simply cost-cutting. Without years of laying off employees, the company would have gone under - and their business has been suffering for years because of it. Managers everywhere in the corporation just try to dangle the carrot of a raise or promotion without any intent of ever offering one. There are no annual cost of living raises (I had exactly one  Awful company.in the last 8 years I worked there) and they do not hire full time employees - only contract so they have the flexibility to downsize."
bad,"I love how much I learned from that job, and it made great money. The company later shut down and people were paid out because of it so I think that sheds some pretty fair light on how well management was and the company as a whole"
bad,"Super stresful, need to meet sales goals even though you were customer service to get any sort of advancement, management is okay depending on the person. People wore pajamas? Messy desks, broken chairs, slow computers."
bad,"No talking allowed, pay based on number of documents finished so basically, no breaks, teamlead was berating and all out miserable. "
bad,Xerox does not recognize its administrative or operation employees. The only ones recognized are sales reps. whether they're good or bad reps. Growth also comes at a snails pace.
bad,"the management doesn't keep you informed and employees aren't valued. each year the benefits are lessened, there are no more. . incentives  taking mandatory courses on our time and that are not geared for the job."
bad,"The company changed under Ursula Burns as CEO. She sold off many divisions and outsourced all office, billing, and sales positions. "
bad,"Xerox is moving all jobs to Gautamala. Letting people go that had been there 20 years or more. Moral is very low. Xerox does not care about keeping jobs in America, and long time employees."
bad,"For years it was great place to work, but past 5-10 years a total disaster. Senior mgmt mistakes are daily, culture is oppressive  and HR is worthless."
bad,"I hated it there. The pay sucked, managers were over worked and under paid. On top of everything it's super stressful and everything is scripted. If the scripts weren't followed you'll get write ups."
bad,"poor management, poor benefits and way below industry pay. Company give no raises or bonuses and sub-par benefits. Gives no recognition at all. Mismanagement of company is unreal."
bad,The management are bullies. People got sacked because they were poorly once. No guidance/help with training leading to abuse for getting things wrong. A co worker of mine got dismissed after she was in hospital with pneumonia during her probation. Do not work here. Bullies.
bad,"Closed call center after switching name to Conduent. Over 200 employees laid off. Do not recommend company, do not recommend CEO. Mandatory overtime and bonuses were cut after several call centers shutting down."
bad,Management plays favorites and rules apply to some but not all.  Supervisor has no back bone and wants to be everyones friend. The insurance is expensive and the deductible is high.  No perks
bad,"Xerox used to be a great place to work--great compensation, great people, great culture.  But no growth and no real innovation in 10-15 years.  Current management's Approach has been living on expenses cuts to produce financial results...they've cut everything and there's nothing left.  If you're a young person, don't look for work here because this company won't last five years the way things are going."
bad,The only thing they have is good benefits. This company need to look into getting more and better supervisors and trainers. They are messy and very negative. They really do need a change. I love the training class but all the pressure and slick diss is very unnecessary.
bad,"Not an ideal place to work. Very few supervisors available for CSR questions, and to provide resolutions for customers. Very stressful place to work..."
bad,This place was very unprofessional. The upper management were very disrespectful. There was not a lot of help. Training only taught you the basics of taking calls not what you actually need to know. Very hard to get fired there
bad,Was told most of the company would be laid off but we would be kept. We worked half of the next day after everyone was laid off then was told not to come back until further notice.
bad,My review of this job reflects on the work environment. The work environment is a huge distraction to what the objectives of the required training courses. The class sizes are entirely to large with a large number of students unwilling to focus in on work material.
bad,I learned to never get content with a place or position keep looking at other jobs and keep striving to move up in the company and always do your best at all times.
bad,This place is for those that have no desires to advance in the company.  The pay is horrible and unfair and you never know how much you will be paid on a weekly basis.  The work incentive is on production basis.  It depends on how much work you do to how much you are paid.  It is set up making it almost impossible to meet their quota regardless of how good you work.  Very unfair.
bad,one of the lowest paid call centers in the area you get docked if you don't use the say things exactly like they want you to say. If you ask about promotions they always have an excuse of why your not good enough. Within my first two months with this company i was in the top 50 out of 900 employees in my rating and still got no where with the company. i was offerd a better position at another company and put my two weeks notice in and they immediately told me that by quitting i will not be getting my bounos for the month prior or that month
bad,"Management is uncoordinated, complex and misinformed. They will accuse and prosecute employees without noting the evidence provided prior to the situation at hand. They are manipulative and rude while the superiors below them showcase business ethics and respect for their fellow employees."
bad,"take inbound calls related to health and insurance. make outbound calls to advise the participants of current research status,updates."
bad,The hardest part of the job was the different time zones that patients were calling from and also the prescription names were hard to pronounce.  The most enjoyable part of the job was coming to work to see my coworkers and to help the patients with their prescription in the mail or at the pharmacy.
bad,The hours were good but the starting pay was not.  A typical day would be to go to cubicle and put on headset and start receiving customer calls.
bad,"Xerox is a very tough organization.  The finance jobs are extremely demanding.  I currently, work 12 hour days and some weekend."
bad,Incoming calls helping the customers with placing refill order and making payments or billing questions.
bad,"This is great for someone who doesn't have a love of management and leading a team, but I am in my prime when I am leading or working in the Radiology scene."
bad,The type of employees that this company attracts are not very dedicated to having jobs. There is a lot of morale issues and a lot of unresolved issues. The salary is a joke.
bad,The company was amazing before it was purchased by Xerox. The managers cared about the employees and their families. Now this is just a major corporation and everyone is scared they will be laid off in the next round.
bad,Terrible Place to work lack of organazation. Ok working environment and lack of pay doesnt make it any better.
bad,"A tyoical work day at Xerox is very disorderly and unprofessional, I learned alot about working on my own and getting the job done correctly, management and coworker are unprofessional as well. What I enjoy most is my customers and helping people."
bad,"They do have a great work life balance, Do not have great process in awarding or recognizing tenured employees.  Support from upper level managers when major issues arise does not happen.  The most difficult part of the job was getting support when needed. Left to figure it out on our own to support our customers.  The employees and former team mates were the enjoyable part of the job."
bad,The company needs a lot of work done to keep workers there because of the training classes there is no structure on how the job needs to be done when put in the center by yourself
bad,Improve training and stress management as well I found surveys unfair and irrelevant to job performance and often caused less productive work environments
bad,"They hired me in 2014, paying $9.10 / hour with zero benefits, zero perks (no free coffee even), zero vacation time, zero retirement plan, nothing."
bad,not a good place to work cultur extremely cut throat and immature. no chance for advancement in the area and very little room for growth. all they care about is investors profits
bad,"large case load, low pay, benefits were not very good.  No raises each year.  Expectations were great but tools to work with were very limited.  I did enjoy trying to help people."
bad,"Laid off, never had a chance to really learn the position since it was a temp to hire and the management made sure we knew the possibility of not being hired."
bad,"short term focused - cutting cost - lack of product development - lack of employee growth opportunity.    "
bad,"Contractors and Regular employees have worked for many years without raises. Contractors only benefit is: They have a job. No paid holidays, no paid vacation and no sick time. The only thing guaranteed is: Nothing. Contractor jobs can be cancelled without any warning."
bad,Fun work place for younger atmosphere. Typical day was just answering phones calls all day and helping the customers. I enjoyed working with so many people.
bad,"This used to be a great company but due to poor management every employee could be let go at anytime with no warning. The entire culture is now ran by the ""bean counters"". Instead of building and designing quality products the entire development cycle is spent figuring out which features to cut for cost reduction. In a few more years Xerox will most likely no longer exist."
bad,"Xerox is a good paying job but as far as work environment I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. they pay good but you are bully everyday into finishing your work our you will loose your job. There is  a HR department that basically tells you to talk to your manager. Your manager tells you that they are listening but pretty much whatever is said by supervisor goes. Then nothing is private they tell the supervisor and then you are a easy target from there getting only your work check on every mistake. There where days I didn't take a lunch so I could finish my work I was told by my supervisor I can fire you for that you need to hurry with your work or you'll end up like the rest of the non employees that no longer work here.They don't do verbal,written orfinally written they just fire you. And they always backstab other employees and upper management and get them fire to save on money or to help keep there jobs. I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"My Position was outsource to Xerox Corp. who promised at least 2 years employment and/or advancement in the company after they cut our pay and raise the number of hours we had to work. Once they learned our production they moved it out of state. Then without notice, laid-off everyone they promised to take care of.  On top of that, we were not  to seek employment with Xerox for one year after they laid us off."
bad,I am able to handle confidential information with sensitivity and discretion in accordance with Data Privacy requirements.
bad,"Xerox at one point was a good company to work for, but after years of layoffs, no pay raises, benefit cuts, and general budget cuts, it feels more like a tomb.  The current direction of Xerox is going away from engineering and into low end services, call centers.  Outsourcing is a common word within the company."
bad,A typical day at work was stressful and very unorganized. There was no room for growth. Co-workers was resally pleasent. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers. the job was stressful but I still did my job and well.
bad,"Where to begin? Probably the worst Salaries in the London region unless you are lucky enough to tupe across."
bad,"Xerox IM Team runs dozens of Project and Programmes from Service improvement through to the introduction of new services aimed to meet either a Global or a Specific Business Unit's needs."
bad,"What I was doing was amazing, it was the management that made me leave. I had a manager hit on me and touch me inappropriately, told the manager above him and nothing was done."
bad,"xerox was a wonderful experience, i surprised myself by still knowing how to navagate there different computer programs, as we as problem solving skills & finding the soultion to the probhlem."
bad,"the overall work environment was not pleasing. very hostile and way too much going on, on a daily basis. I did not like it because there was drama, there was physical and verbal fights. It was never a professional work environment."
bad,"Management isn't that great, communication sucks and management tends to misconduct their role then penalize you if you lack in any area which is unfare"
bad,It was an ok job just wasn't for me sitting taking calls all day especially with the rude customers calling in about stuff being their fault not yours
bad,For the short time I was employed with this company I experienced the worse management team that I have ever seen. They fixed the numbers and refuse to listen.
bad,"Management is poor and unprofessional. You do not have PTO. You will be working for Brother and what they say goes.. They are under paying you! If you like stress, being treated unfairly this is the job for you. Please do not work here!! The SBU manger is not going to treat u fair at all. Its favoritism all the way around.."
bad,"No Appraisals , No Promotions Join this company only if you are not career ambitious.Not recommended. Zero Learning .Poor Management.Good co workers . No policy . Co workers are highly co operative."
bad,"It is a great job, but management is out of control. Their is so much favoritism and they flaunt it in your face. Only a few are working others and laughing, talking about how they are trying to get their homework completed and where they are going to get drinks after work, not to mention those that are sleep on their desk in front of everybody to see that they do not have to take any calls. Truly UNFAIR!"
bad,The company is horrible. They do not pay for work needed to meet expectations. But the coworkers and supervisors are amazing for the most part. Very kind but company sucks.
bad,The managers were good but they changed my schedule without any notice.  Loved learning about the Microsoft Xbox and was trained to be a technical representative.
bad,"Management was never on one accord, however the co-workes made the job semi enjoyable"
bad,I batch insurance checks most of the day and index insurance documents.
bad,managers would favor people and give them opportunities to who they like and not not who deserved it. Everyday felt like the day you would be laid off.
bad,a typical day at my job is from 7:30am to 5:00pm..i work in an office with 6 other coworkers i like my job but im a people person i love working with the public and i love customer service so thats why im trying to find something better and also with better pay.
bad,Xerox a calling center for verizon. When you call verizon customer Service it’s usually bad right? Well its not the representatives fault but u are still mad because we are all verizon...
bad,"Responds to telephone inquiries and complaints using scripts and procedures"
bad,"I enjoyed my work environment, very relaxed atmosphere. I worked there for 5 years and never had any major issues; nice benefits and I loved the overtime"
bad,"You spend a month and a half in training, and training is the best part of the job, but once you are on the floor in production, you are pretty much on your own. This makes your job especially difficult because the environment, policies and even equipment and software are ever-changing. The only reason you would stay is because of the friendships you build with the people who work there because there isn't much else going for it. I will say that they truly do try to make the work environment more enjoyable, but sitting in a cubicle all day, receiving calls from people who don't care about anything except for where you work, it wears you down eventually. There is upward mobility, but it is definitely based on relationships more than qualification."
bad,"easy first job, few responsibilities, minimum wage, great food! nice customers"
bad,"Being a customer service representative for this company is fairly easy. I come to work, mingle with my employees, and get my job done in a professional manner. This job has given me a lot of experience as far as providing technical support to customers and being a technical support advisor. XEROX has also taught me how to be patient and deal with upset customers. The hardest part of this job is explaining Apple's policy and term of agreements to customers who have never read the policy and does not understand why they are in the situation they are in. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I get nice and pleasant customers who are satisfied with the resolution I provide for them."
bad,This job didn't provide much flexability with family life and the managers didn't advocate for the employees.  They required over-time from everybody and expected too much from the employees during the shift.  You were only allotted 2 breaks and if you needed to use the restroom outside of those breaks you were unpaid.  
bad,I applied for a level 1 position but was hired at level 3. No one ever comes to work so you do your job and theirs and do not get paid for it and ot happens without forewarning.  You also never know what's going on because they never tell you anything!!! You find out pretty much everything by asking fellow associates because the actual supervisors dont know anything
bad,call center. it always stayed busy. Staff was unprofessional but the job itself was character building. I like that there was room for growth and learning experiences
bad,You get cussed out by the people on the phone and all your allowed to do is apologize or place them on hold which makes them madder. Pay should be increased for the clients you deal with.
bad,The company was very unorganized at times. There were plenty of occasions were checks were not correctly received do to company error. Notice of company changes was not properly conveyed.
bad,Worked there for over 3 yrs started as prepaid rep..promoted to Supervisor on another project n laid off due to company not thriving ..worst management n lots of favoritism within the company
bad,"Even if that job was still open to work at, I still would not recommend someone to work there.  It was probably one of the worst jobs I ever had.  I only liked the hours."
bad,"I did not have a great experience, very unorganized and hard to advance.  Managers are not knowledgeable and tend to play favorites.  You are not rewarded for the work you do."
bad,I only worked for Xerox because they originally hired me then Conduent came in and took over. Xerox was a great company but the management was very hard to get in contact with at times.
bad,"Terrible management and no hope of moving up. Micromanaged, and no respect for employees. Cant even go to the restroom without using your 30 minutes of break time a day."
bad,"It was a hard place to work if you cant handle being cussed out all day. The coworkers are amazing, but the hours make the job even harder. Mandatory overtime takes a lot away from family"
bad,"When first hired at Xerox they provided excellent training in customer service. Dealing with Apple customers, I've gained plenty of experience in dealing with frustrated customers. As of now the company is no longer a vendor for Apple."
bad,"Xerox was very unorganized and non professional, it's hard to work somewhere knowing you provide great customer service, then your own management does not or refuse to lead by example"
bad,Eight hour shift with two shifts. Can be laid off any time. Demanding emotionally and psychologically. Rules keep changing every day. No job security at all
bad,"the building is very dirty. I was sick constantly. The bathrooms are not clean or sanitary. The job is based on how many surveys you can pass. Even if you did everything you could to get a customer's prob fixed, if they didn't like you and failed your survey it would bring your numbers down."
bad,The job was ok in the beginning worked for Tricare did enrollment for government insurance went to call center to help our the moved to mail room the hardest part was trying to make 40 hours after mail was done went home work with out being on phon e
bad,Great folks. A real relaxed place to work with good working conditions. Management made it very comfortable and relaxoimg environment to be in. Plenty of time off
bad,Bad for my career path. Mismanagement was the norm and attitudes were bad and I dreaded clocking in it was the worst work decision I could have ever made.
bad,training was very dull and boring.  trainers need to think of better ways to train employees rather than boring classroom environment that is reminiscent of high school.
bad,This company cares about no one. They will not work with your schedule. They managers are unprofessional. They expect too much from people and when made aware that they are asking for too much they do nothing.
bad,Management was not professional and never listened to employees and not even customers. they where more focused on numbers and ratings then productivity.
bad,"Where to begin. Well, the office was a physically unhealthy (Bedbugs, nasty smells, close quarters). The customers were often over-the-top in their displays of anger, often cursing at the top of their lungs and threatening me with violence."
bad,They hired a bunch of people and then after 2 weeks of awful training they realized they over hired. We then were all fired. It was a very unprofessional experience.
bad,Xerox is an ok place to work it's not hard but it's not easy as well I just do not think that the job is for me the job is cool on some days but some days I feel like the requirement to stay employed is too much
bad,the company was not organized at all. but the training program was very helpful. long days not a lot of breaks but everyone was always smiling
bad,Very unprofessional. Workers and supervisors barely wants to do their jobs. Has had problems with bed bugs and other bugs . Also unorganized hard to plan and follow thru with events.
bad,"For a Customer Service Company, the company should listen to the employees on the phone calls received.  Scripts were pushed at staff to utilize and at times the info on the scripts did not properly fix the problem.  Staff were not encouraged to stay on the call too long and the management would signal to yo to cut it short."
bad,"I worked for Sprint under Xerox. Horrible, horrible horrible. They do not care about employees. Will fire you at the drop of a dime( highest turnover rate). When I resigned( was not fired), 2 months later they were closing the site. Didn't surprise me one bit."
bad,"Your hours will change week to week and you will not get full time hours 50% of the time.  The 4 week training was great, but they don't  practice what they teach in training."
bad,When first starting the job we were assigned one thing yet it did not turn out this way. No room for advancement or growth.
bad,"I applied part time job foe this company and I got run around and i wasnt given a fair chance to get an interview after i mentioned that i am hearing impaired, i offered to make $10 an hour for part time and passed the typing test. ive attempted to contact several time for an interview, i was told that they have someone in mind in their inside company. Why post the job position if they are interested in someone who works there."
bad,"Didn't like the company, rude bosses/ management. change your schedule last minute and wouldnt care about what your availability was when they hired you. change bosses all the time, hated it"
bad,they don't care   about you all they care about is the job you could be in the hospital an they are calling you an wanting to know when you were coming back to work
bad,I loved the people I worked with and the work I was doing. I cannot really discuss much more about it due to some extenuating circumstances.
bad,horrible job. would never work any custom care because of this job. cramped spaces stinky co workers. noisy workfield and lousy management.
bad,They have a high over turn rate. We were always working with new every month and losing a person every week. No one I train with was there when I left the company.
bad,"Typical day: Come in to work early to be logged on to your phone system by the start time of your shift. Learned: Nobody calls a call center to tell them how great the service is. Management: very supportive and willing to help in any way possible. Co-workers: seemed like nice people. Very little communication on 10 minute breaks, zero communication on the floor. Hardest part of the job: sitting for hours (zero exercise), maintaining sanity and a steady heart rate while being yelled at repeatedly by angry customers."
bad,I really enjoyed working at this company! This job actually look for stenghts in the works and acted on them. I was able to move up fairly quickly with the knowledge I had. My computer would not let me choose any more stars but i would rate it a 4 star
bad,"Training was not even what I would call training. the place is gross the people are rude. you are treated like a child or some convict were you are watched to make sure you are not on your cell phone or have paper on your desk. 15 min break and don't be one second late on getting back or it's into the fire you go. trying to talk with elderly people while co-workers are in the background just talking away to where you cannot hear what the person is saying to you. some co-workers don't even work they just sit there staring at the computer screen not even taking any calls. This has been the worst job I have ever had in my life and I don't think anyone should work her unless you are smelly, a misfit of life, lazy, and just plain stupid. I will be getting out as soon as I find another job, started looking the 1st day I was there."
bad,"The absolute worst place to work in the entire world, they hire messy childish hoodrats with no credentials at all. Hate everyday I had to come o work. Id rather work at burger king"
bad,"No chance for advancement, poor management, no consistency with work instructions, or policies and procedures, low salary even with experience"
bad,"Fast paced call center environment, where after a brief training course you will be expected to problem solve independently"
bad,I really do not like to review past jobs other than being able to say I gained more knowledge and experience under my belt with each and any past employer to become as professional and efficient as I can for future employers.
bad,was a great place to work but no new products have led to a change in business direction. as such with no business ambitions it is not a challenging place to work.
bad,i hated working for this company with a passion. Its the most unprofessional atmosphere ever. Favoritism is everywhere. If you're not a favorite you wont last long at all.
bad,Management didn't know what was going on was lied to and the didn't stand up for the employees even when they knew that were right.
bad,"The ACS building in Cary, NC is not the place to start a career. It is unprofessional and very spiteful. Tip of the day:"
bad,"My job with Xerox Staffing was only a learning experience."
bad,A typical day is staying glued to your seat phone call after phone call with an allotted five minutes after a 1 fifteen minute break and a thirty minute lunch. It takes an five minutes to walk from your cubical to your car and the bathrooms as well.
bad,"working there is very stressful, non friendly environment, no support from management, if you are not already equipped with the knowledge and information needed to do your job properly,"
bad,"This job is not organized at all. The ""management"" is unprofessional, and majority of them have no clue what they're doing. You can go from CSR to supervisor without any knowledge of the way things work. Overall terrible place to work, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
bad,During an eight hr shift I would make about $30 because we were paid per call and for some reason agents were only taking about 30 calls a day. I always felt on edge and as if I could be fired at any moment. Tempers clashed between managers and employees and security had a way of bothering certain people.
bad,Not the ideal place to work. Unorganized and unprofessional environment. I would not recommend working here. Stay where you are at.
bad,not really a good company not to professional. very boring job. there is always somebody money getting took from them. I always had to get around in crazy weather and they do not know how to treat employees
bad,"Unrealistic quotas which they have no justification for."
bad,I answered the phone for customer concerns daily. I was to help customer with any inquiry on their account or the device. Calls generally were back to back but sometimes they were slow. The hardest part of the job was the irate customers and calming them down which for me was never and issue. I was always able to calm a customer down with any situation I was able to de escalate the problem by empathizing with the customer and their situations
bad,Please find somewhere else to work. Rude and unprofessional managers.
bad,"Xerox has chosen not to integrate ACS, Inc. into the Xerox fold. ACS is an excellent human services company - providing a variety of industries with outsourcing opportunities to permit them to cut costs, mandate service levels and receive excellent service. Xerox does not understand that ""Human Services"" means providing skilled resources and they set a goal for 2014 of reducing US ACS employees and real estate holdings by 50%. This is handicapping our ability to provide the service we're known for - employees that have the skills and initiative to get the work completed well and on time."
bad,"	Listened to live and recorded calls"

bad,uma empresa que deu a mim uma oportunidade de adquirir conhecimentos sobre digitação e manuseio de programas e digitação de trabalhos!
bad,"Fast paced work enviroment, always something new to learn."
bad,"This was the worst job I have ever worked. The management is horrible and when you weren't scheduled for a break, you had to ask to use the restroom. Your breaks are very short and they had many mandatory overtime hours."
bad,Poor management of performance reviews - goals are not aligned with job responsibilities. Peer review is completed by co-workers that  also competes with you.  Little to no opportunities for advancement. Company goal is to offshore jobs.  Salary increases are non existent. The hardest part of the job is dealing with co-workers who are afraid to lose their jobs too. The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to provide excellent benefit plan administration to various clients.
bad,supervisors picked favorites and did not follow regulations.very disrespectful
bad,"A comfortable place to work, enjoyed my time at the company was made redundant as i was working for an agency."
bad,"•	Coordinate department activities and special projects to ensure all KPI’s are met consistently"
bad,"I initially really enjoyed the job. The job itself became the background to a nightmare of failed surveys or write-ups for not meeting statistical numbers or, or .................There seemed to always be something wrong with the daily numbers or stats and became a huge distraction to actually doing the job!!"
bad,"The co-workers are the only good thing about Xerox ACS. The job is emotionally draining. But, I hate the coded mandatory overtime without notifying agents on production. Can't wait to leave this place. Plus promotions are not worth it here."
bad,Large company
bad,"Answering phones to provide excellent customer service for technical issues, responsible for maintaining goodwill between the organization and its customers by answering questions, solving problems, and providing advice or assistance in utilizing the goods or services of the organization."
bad,"I enjoyed my job, the customers were great yet the company is on a downward spiral. If management were more supportive and customer service reps felt needed the company would florish. Working at XEROX made me feel like a number not a valued employee."
bad,Stay away. A strong corporate atmosphere. It was miserable
bad,"I worked at ACS, a xerox company that took verizon wireless customer service calls... That place was just awful. The pay was awful, the AC was awful, they always let you know your job came first, family came second. They dont even have excellent customer service standards. The coaching is just silly, that's all it is. I would always get told that I was too understanding for the customer, What is customer service if you're not understanding to the customers needs? that place really ticked me off, I didn't last long there at all, plus the pay was a joke. I would get pulled from my lunch or breaks just for meetings. I really hated it there."
bad,"The job was easy. Pay was poor and people were nice to be around. "
bad,I cried at work because of the desperation in my customer's voice!  I should have resigned then but I thought I could handle the job.  The pay was inadequate!
bad,I enjoyed my time there but am in search for better career opportunities.
bad,"Overall the people were great to work with. However tools, communication were not good.management tried their best to assist. they did have prices for good numbers and attendance, helped us bring employees to work."
bad,"-Learned a lot and got free job training"
bad,I was an Sr elig person I trained I coach the employee I did the hire process I work in all different dept. management was ok. I did the attendance and coaching
bad,Xerox is an exciting place to work. Daily routine of answering calls to assist members with mail order prescriptions. teams consist of 15-20 coworkers assigned to one supervisor. Xerox always have room for advancing
bad,"face pace, working with army about dental insurance and enrollment and making sure that everyone had the correct dental insurance and made there payments ever day"
bad,"Horrible place to work, poor management and the workers are always angry."
bad,Training for this occupation went through very smoothly. I honestly didn't learn anything until I hit the production floor. Management is terrible but a typical day at work was fine.
bad,"be ready to be screamed at by people calling in, every phone call you take. Most days every person is very upset and dont know how to be even slightly respectful to others."
bad,This Job was ok don't recommend it if you can't handle being yelled at. Manager are great if your working in the BGCO department. Regular customer care sucks.
bad,processing data for companies in a time sensitive environment.
bad,The job is I ran by all the wrong people. Management shows favoritism to their friends. All politics when trying to advance. Can say a lot more but it's too much
bad,Poor management and unclear vision. High Turnover due to low wage and unwise staffing decisions. Device Technicians are always stressed and overworked.
bad,"The job was outwardly manipulative and the company was robbing the customers. crammed work spaces and loud noises, minimum pay no benefits no 401k max emotional strain"
bad,"Dealing with customers to call and complain is not my ideal job. You do get to make friends, you get your 15 minutes break and 30 minute lunch. "
bad,Was hired sub contracted then was performing at one location that they jired me first person to be hired in the company in seven years! was announced at dinnner party only to be taken away the next dayby an officer in xerox. I stoped working in lite of this event and personel in fremont understood. I has earned that and it was taken awat without exsplantion.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of this job is toggling back and fourth from voice calls to chat assistance. Although the job function is the same, technical support to resolve the issue, you can learn different ways of coming to a conclusion."
bad,"At the time I was actively trying to keep my self through school, and this job wasn't going to support that from the start. So for this workplace I thought of it as temporary from the get go."
bad,Xerox-Conduent is a place for younger people. They do not follow chain of command. No room to really grow or advance. The most they pay as a CCS is $12.00. They train you in multiple skill sets with no pay increase. People will not likely to be promoted. Doctor excuses not allowed. Very negative energy and stressful.
bad,This place has absolutely no job security. The management team is very unprofessional. This is not a great place to work if you are an established adult with bills.
bad,"HR standards and practices in a Will at Work State (NC) are null and void. Lateral transfers between positions are extinct, a set schedule does not apply to this company, mandated overtime with less than 1 hour notice, benefit options are lousy and expensive for the pay scale offered."
bad,"Managers were unprofessional and not well trained.  Environment is poor, OT not given all year long as they said.  Management not very nice to you and the pay was very low for the importance of the job."
bad,the management of the business was difficult to deal with a lot of favoritism they didn't want to work around people going to school or even if you ave problems with child care they where very inconsiderate of everyone but themselves
bad,Management has no idea what reps have to deal with when it comes to customers. There's never enough help to deal with difficult issues. And heaven for bid you need time off.
bad,"Nothing to say hated it, you were not treated fairly my job was threatened on a daily bases, never got constructive criticism form supervisor, was harassed by others and made to feel uncomfortable"
bad,Terrible Managment.  The power hunger there was so unexpected and surprising.   It was never a smooth day.  Someone was always being picked on.   We earned bonuses and never received them.  The worse thing about this company was that so many people counted on them for their income.  I was one of the lucky ones who was able to leave the company without being fired .  This company is now closed.
bad,Worked in a department of 20 people. Workload was too high where the advisors took 200% expected call volume. Management wanted you to work hours regardless of if you could actually get there or not. Uncaring and cold
bad,"In a typical day you received 30-40 calls with 50% of the members calling being mad at the customer so the rates of the rep went down. I know customer service is for the member but the representative also needs to be given better compensation, only one day off and mandatory overtime at any time."
bad,"Worked for Xerox as contract worker under CVS pharmacies. We were constantly forced to face the threat of our contract being cut due to our location being too expensive in Hawaii. Thankfully before they cut my whole department I transferred to a more secure contract job in the same office but still faced the same odds. Very stressful, no one wants to work somewhere under constant threat of losing their job to that degree."
bad,it's a lot of work and management is not so fun of the workers ..it's hard to take days off..the over time there is mandatory no matter the hours. they don't like to work around school schedules
bad,I do not regret working at this company because I have learned to become more patient with people because I was constantly with angry customers. I would not go back there though.
bad,"	Answering incoming calls for emergency roadside assistance"
bad,Don't work here! They do the give raises ...they lie about  hiring you permanently in 90 days. Their training sucks. Too many issues
bad,"The training class was the best part of when I worked there. The manager in the training class made sure we customer service reps was doing before we even hit the floor, even though my training class was put on the floor almost three weeks ahead of schedule. Not to mention the work environment was not pleasant at all, due to how disgusting the floors and restrooms stayed. Another thing I did not like about it was the fact the management abused there power all the time."
bad,"They go based off call flow , if you have bills to pay but they have no work good luck!"
bad,The job responsibilities is great I love to help people and get them health coverage because health coverage is very important. I dislike the company values and what they stand for as a company. They do not care about the quality of work being done they care about just getting it done by any means necessary. I take pride in what I do because people families and life depends on health coverage.
bad,"uncaring about employees"
bad,"There is no area to grow, the company does not show appreciation for outstanding and hard working employees, there were no incentives, and the co-workers were very unprofessional, the best part was when it was time to go home...."
bad,While working at Xerox there was way Too much favoritism  and not enough attention to detail . There should be more accuracy and willingness to assist
bad,"There is no room for advancement, too much favoritism, no organization, they don't care about their employees, lowest paying call center in Charlotte, NC"
bad,Too much negative and too many system problems to create a decent days work.  Management yelling at you and customer yelling at you.  Don't want to do a call center again.
bad,"Not a place to work if you are looking for steady environment, management was very fickle and not professional.  Only worked there because it was close to home would not recommend them a place to work."
bad,Unable to move up in company. Favoritism within company. Supervisors only on you due to new bonus rule going based of numbers. Unprofessional individuals. Job is revolving door.
bad,"The management sucked. A lot of the bosses were sleeping with the female employees, a lot of drama as if you were in high school, very strict and there was no flexibility in the schedules."
bad,"Great place to work while looking for a better paying job with benefits. However, this is a productive company that processes DC Medicaid claims; with very little room for errors. Nonetheless, the atmosphere is relaxed, without being micro-managed."
bad,"When management talks down to their top performers and belittles their success, then a mass exodus is just months away."
bad,"I love what I do and I am very good at it! "
bad,"Great place to work if you don't want a life outside of work, or spend time with your children. You scan documents onto a computer the entire shift, and you work mostly overtime and overtime on Saturdays. And you aren't allowed to talk while at work."
bad,"working in this job was good learning experience but management is horrible, bad position for a person who can't handle the position and blames everyone for their own mistakes!!!!!"
bad,"The Green Road Location is bad"
bad,They don't care about people they care about volume. Not a flexible place to work if you have a family. They do not give raises at all and I was there for 3 years and promoted twice.
bad,"I have been a employee for 7 years they teach you very bad, no rais,e no job promotion. this company is not what it seems to be."
bad,"Responsibility changes daily"
bad,"Xerox was the first call center for me. I was a great experience.  I learn a lot working there but I also know it was not a job long term. Work force micro managed the agents every move "
bad,this company this company hmmmm lets see. I loved it. The days go by so slow.
bad,"When I first started working at Xerox, I was what you would call ""wide eyed & bushy tailed""!  I was so eager to learn and still is till this day.  I used to hear certain colleagues complain but I took them as being negative until I was able to witness the way business is handled here.  I have witnessed and continue to witness favoritism, rudeness to reps from my supervisor, micro-management at its worst, etc.  No one has received a raise since I have been employed here at Xerox with no raises due in the near future.  Certain people have been ""groomed"" for certain positions while the people who have been here for years with good track records are being looked over.  There is no room for advancement and its very depressing.  The majority of my team (75%) is on FMLA and we have been struggling to meet our monthly goals (SLA) since the new supervisor has been on board.  Just a couple of days ago, I and others on the team has been meeting with a high-level HR representative that was brought in from out of town to investigate our supervisor.  Other departments also are not happy with the way they are treated.  I don't believe in ""burning bridges"" so I believe the best thing for me to do is to search for another job with another company."
bad,Job was easy but management wanted to come up with 200 unnecessary rules and regulations which made things difficult.
bad,"The constant irritation of having to log into a program consistently due logging you out constantly if it wasn't in use within 5 minutes to assist a client was irritable due upon getting graded on accuracy and time managing the call to 7 minutes. The beginning of the shift was always a challenge when even getting there 30 minutes early to begin shift because the cubicles were dirty, broken, or not available."
bad,Very lengthy application process including a typing speed test and a very lengthy pre-employment questionnaire to complete before any interviews start. Then you receive a negative email from Xerox thanking for your interest and never proceeding into a promised second interview. You have immature children trying to be mature in handling all applicants and these same people never give respect to older applicants.
bad,Loved the people I worked with but not happy how the company treats there employees.  I worked very hard for this company and was very reliable and dedicated.  Most co-workers are very unhappy there.
bad,"More works, low salary, no bonus, no lunch, no extra benefit......."
bad,would not work there again
bad,"Working at Xerox you are expected to work overtime for free until the job is complete, despite the work load being completely unrealistic and and despite being understaffed!"
bad,At the time Xerox was a good job if you don’t mind being in a poor an unhealthy working environment. Poor management. The job that title is great being call center agent an doing nothing but upgrading insurance policy’s and also doing road side services.
bad,"Would not recommend this company to anyone else, difficult hiring process, for a job that doesn't have good communication, and benefits are horrible, lengthy training on information that doesn't concern or pretend to the position, truly not worth the time and effort..."
bad,"it was okay in the start but maybe i was naive."
bad,"The company had bed bugs, spreading on employees belongs , and you cant complain."
bad,"As an employee, you're treated as a statistic and only your numbers and productivity matters. The pay is based on your performance and fluctuates if your performance is good during month and not as good the next. There is a large turnover rate because of poor treatment from management. Your schedule can be changed with little notice due to ""business needs"". Overall, not a good place to work"
bad,nothing to say about Xerox. if you need a job really quickly please apply. You will be hired and they don't really check references. Most people will be hired on the spot
bad,"Didn't allow the loud music and screaming as a lot of the call centers do. Several college grads which made it a bit more interesting but managers were horrific and very mean to employees.Like most call centers, people have to have money to survive, then they move on when they can."
bad,"I had experience of data entry on computers pulling up and inputting/updating customers information multitasking while speaking with normal to irate customers due to rates, price increases, services, sales and troubleshooting equipment etc."
bad,"xerox cuando era  multinacional  era espectacular  el ambiente  laboral,  con  la compra  de DELCO  empresa  venezolana   se  acabo  los benéficos  y  comisiones."
bad,"I worked for Xerox services - the call center portion. The facilities "
bad,"It definitely needed more communication to be able to clearly understand the terms and conditions. Just lacks basic communication skills and it would be such a smoother and moving company if everyone was on the same exact page at all times. Being told that due to me falling on the side of the stairs with the camera and no physical proof, that it didn't truly happen."
bad,"very stressful with contradictory expectations never supposed to let people off the phone unhappy, but you lack the ability to satisfy many customer requests"
bad,I didn't like it because I felt it was easy to get fired. I also didn't like that they required us to work over time. My health went down hill ( I was pregnant) and that kept the rooms too cold.
bad,"•	Handling billing inquiries and service requests"
bad,"Working for xerox was a challenge to say the least, the management was never on the same page, advancement was all in title and not in pay. Working the early shift was a plus but not worth the hostile environment."
bad,aprendi si tambien a vender seguros algunas técnicas.
bad,The job itself wasn't difficult.  It was the work environment.  The managers didn't have a clue on what to do.  And the moral of the company was horrible.
bad,"The work was fun but only because it was doing Google Tech Support, Google was fantastic to us, but anything good that Google wanted to do Xerox would put a stop to so that they could make as much money as possible. This company Xerox DOES NOT CARE ABOUT EMPLOYEE'S! AT ALL! They pretend to care, managers have no idea what they're doing, most co-worked know more than managers. Managers at Xerox are like babysitters pretending they know how to take care of children. If you value yourself at all you will run quickly away from any opportunity provided to you by Xerox."
bad,they except to much they think they can pay you junk pay and no benefits. There daily quotas are a joke. And they threatin jobs a lot. not someplace I will ever go back to.
bad,Call center set up in a large warehouse long hours management were basically had the same mental capacity of high school bullies tiring unrewarding work
bad,"One typically is brought on as a temporary, for six months, and the contract is renewed. One may be temporary (working 40 hrs, no benefits) for up to 3 years before being brought on as full-time. The morale was low, and therefore high turnover."
bad,Xerox couldn't make the company profitable and we ended up being separated from Xerox and formed our own company Conduent. Conduent is now struggling to keep us afloat
bad,"its not so much the job itself but the people working and the environment, the pay is far from enough for the things you are required to do and the stress that you have to deal with on a daily basis."
bad,Its not a bad place but they did close and lots of people lost they're jobs.. The time clocks did not work it said I was late a number of times. but I was always early
bad,"It sucks, pay is bad, culture is bad, you will not be happy. The management does not care, high stress, do not train well, no advancement, overall I did get experience, however it was not a positive environment."
bad,I really enjoyed solving issues for members calling in for information.  My days at work consisted of taking calls from both providers and members.  Providers  would call in about a patients claim or bill.  Members called in about payments and their bills.  I would often direct providers to website pertaining to cpt codes being used.
bad,High staff and management turnovers and company only cares about targets and not their employees. Managers and supervisors break or create their own rules to benefit themselves at the expense of employees.
bad,"Be prepared to be stressed and micro managed.  Xerox places dots of color on the wall to keep us informed that were doing a poor job,  there are calls waiting and there are currently no restroom breaks."
bad,makati site is not safe. airocn is not working well. salary is very incompetent. employees stay because of the workmates. people are good. not very strict with dresscode
bad,With these customer service positions they will take anyone who isnt a felon and throw them into the fray and hope for the best. They simply contract out customer service positions from all types of businesses and when that fails you lose your job.
bad,management and pay sucks no room for advancement. they tell you one thing then do another. just a horrible experience overall
bad,Ondanks dat je wel op verschillende afdelingen kon werken kreeg je geen vaste aanstelling
bad,"The pay is ok and the work is rewarding on the campaign that I worked but the upper management and supervisor shows no respect to the employees and the have no consideration for their employees.  The employees are treated horrible; their hours and time is changed on a regular basis sometimes without them even knowing and they are held responsible if they dont comply. Its all about who you know and who butt you are kissing in  xerox in order to get treated fairly,let alone exceptional.  your work and work ethics doesnt matter.  the whole system is backwards and thats why their turn over rate is extremely high and they are always hiring"
bad,"The changes made to the company when it was bought by Xerox made it really difficult to keep a good attrition rate."
bad,Gained great experience. Company had limited opportunities for advancement. Mgmt worked hard with the tools they had.
bad,"In this specific call center, when we were hired on they told us we would be making $9-$13 per hour depending on performance. Well I like to believe I am a top performer so I would receive highest amount paid. They didn't mention it depended on your surveys. Regardless if I handled the call well and the customer was satisfied with my customer service, if the was upset with the company they would give a negative survey."
bad,"Xerox is a company that is solely bent on making money. They do great at paying employees however, it seems that there are more ways to take your money than to make your money."
bad,most unprofessional place have ever worked and i worked at a McDonald's. drug use is obvious and flaunted. hirring culture is quantity over quality. bad atmosphere
bad,Opportunity to advance limited to certain people. When you obtain additional skill you are suppose to get a raise but you don't. You are suppose to get an annual raise but do not. I have learned a lot about Medicare benefits.  Must be in a cliche in order to advance. Management not friendly
bad,"Being able to assist other people is the best thing about this job. It is very stressful and exhausting in certain areas since you are required to ""stay on your toes"" as far as being available to assist Indiana residents. There are perks to the job but there are many more down falls. You get quality reviews on work completed, you have to meet a certain quota and received at least a 97% on Quality to even receive a bonus on top of your base pay. Just recently we learned that our pay would change, overall we will be placed on a flat rate pay and it has been made a lot difficult for you to achieve your bonus, to some people, this will be a pay decrease."
bad,I liked the people I worked with but management was constantly changing. Also from day to day you didn't know if you would still have a job.
bad,"Answer inbound customer service calls for a cell phone provider. Calls can include but not limited to: billing questions, price plans, equipment upgrades, tier one technical support, credits and adjustments. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers. Management needs a little work, meaning very little communication to employees when policies changes, also, they tend to play favorites. They will promise you for years that you will be promoted but if you are not one of the favorites then that promotion will never come. The best part is being able to help train the new hires in the nesting department."
bad,"When I was hired at Xerox for a brand new program in 2011, I doubled my salary, and my life changed.  I thought I had finally found the company I was going to retire from.  I was paid pretty darn good for a customer service/data entry position.  After a few years they started to outsource parts of our department.  1st the help desk went to Jamaica, then data entry was moved to the Dominican Republic, and now 5 years later, customer service has been moved to Guatemala.  The lack of respect for the customer is amazing.  Upper management could care less about what the customers want or their employees.  Local management did their best while following the barking orders of the big wigs.  They went above and beyond for the customers as far as they were allowed in order to make up for the mistakes upper management made.  You are just a dollar bill to Xerox that can be replaced for less in another country.  Most of sales is made of a bunch of liars and lazy people.  The good ones are few and far between.  Benefits are horrible and your only option is a high deductible health plan.  Dental barely covers a cleaning.  Holidays are generous and more then the average company.  The ability to work from home if allowed is why some employees stick around.  I thankfully found another job before they could hand me my termination notice.  Xerox lost a great, hard working, determined, and diligent employee when I gave my notice.  I'm moving onto another company for more money, better benefits, and double the vacation time."
bad,The company does not encourage development of their employees or recognize their accomplishments.  They don't provide support in order to make improvements/efficiencies.
bad,"Answer phones and sale medicare insurance to members."
bad,"Company splitting in two, low personal count. Expecting more and more of contract employees without any raise in pay or benefits."
bad,Customers are wonderful. Supervisors and coworkers are another story. You go through 6 weeks of training just to hit the floor and find out that you've learned nothing. You do most of your learning on the floor while taking phone calls.
bad,"normal day is never normal. You know your punch in time, but they will send you home anytime they want.  Friends of supervisor will get special treatment, from parking space to early promotions.  Even if you are the best at what you do you wont be considered if there is any person friend of management. Pay is barely above the minimal (8.00/hr) with no pay raise and co worker that are from the start are still in the $8.00 range."
bad,I worked for Xerox for about 5 months and they were constantly moving management around. A typical day would consist of being at my desk awaiting emails to come in with a request. There was no real unity in our team. The hardest part was going to work with people who weren't willing to work with each other. The most enjoyable part of working at Xerox is the cafeteria. The food there was great.
bad,"supervisors and above have no idea, and will never get back to you with an answer."
bad,"Feels like a school more so than a place to work, no one likes to help. There is no consideration for weather conditions when trying to come to work. We are only allowed 10 minute breaks but its really only like 7 because we have to be back at our pod in exactly 10 minutes."
bad,I believe this place is for high school children. The management is very unprofessional and the enviorrment is unstable. The turn over rate is far too high.
bad,"The typical day at work was turn of your phone before stepping into the call floor. If your phone was on it would be detected by antenna detecting machines and you would be fired immediately no questions asked."
bad,"Basically a glorified clerical position with very low pay, warehouse type environment and little actual pharmacy related activities unless it involved money.  Good example of phamacy dead-end possible future with paper shuffling and phone operator duties replacing traditional phamacist drug intensive responsibilities.  I was gone soon after the training phase when the reality set in."
bad,"The HR solutions is a good group to work for, if you are interested in health benefits, but the company can do a better job with developing employees and designing career pathing."
bad,"The training for this job is terrible.  Due to the time of year that I started my training, we were basically given what was supposed to be two weeks of training, but our particular class only got about 12.5 days. The trainer was very knowledgeable, but basically rushed us through the materials.  After that, you are thrown out on the floor to start taking enrollment calls.  Most of us don't have access to all of the portals at this point, and it makes it difficult sometimes to assist the members with accuracy. Trying to get assistance from your supervisor is almost impossible most times.  "
bad,Telephone Banking - meeting customer needs/requests on a daily basis; always good to provide quality customer service.  Divided into Teams with each phase of training.
bad,i worked here for almost 2 years. the leadership was very unknowledgeble and our call scoring system was almost impossible due to the nature of our angry callers.
bad,I worked there on a temporary assignment for BCBS and it was horrible. I never had a consistent schedule. Schedules changed from week to week. It was pretty easy to get hired there. But it was very cliquey and high school-ish and management was ridiculous. Would NOT recommend.
bad,Not a safe or professional enviornment. Individuals are always fighting and police are at the Charlotte location often. No one seems to follow the code of conduct and a few people are professional within the company.
bad,"I have worked in multiple departments with this company. The upper management is rude and extremely unprofessional (example: the CEO came out on the floor one day red in the face and proceeded to scream at me inches from my face and questioned why his service levels were red,simple answer was not enough staff to cover incoming volume, not much workforce can do at that moment. This was done in the middle of a working and busy call center.)  . The supervisors are under informed, under qualified, ill trained and unknowledgible. They work the few who show initiative and integrity until they can not take it and quit or move departments. There are multiple Ethics violations that go unaddressed. Multiple inappropriate relationships between supervisors and agents. Favortism is very apparent. Department Supervisors will over work those who work harder and more efficent and will not expect results from lazy dead weight supervisors. ALL WORK NO PAYOFF. Seeking employment elsewhere, really not worth it. Watch your pay too, they play with your payrate and subsidize your rate to ""round off your pay"" so if you make $13/hr your pay rate on your checks pay break down says $9/hr but you have an entry for $4/hr you've worked to round off to a $13 payrate. Make sense?Thats how we feel...I heed you warning WORK HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK."
bad,"The company works under the ""piece-rate"" pay, which is the best way to get the most work out of someone with paying them as little as possible. Piece-rate is actually illegal in most states. I worked there for three years and towards the end of my three years I was so unhappy."
bad,Great co-workers but supervisors are held to a different standard and that is nothing. They are never there and don't know what they are doing and so it makes communication difficult. They work employees like machines.
bad,"This was a job that at the time was needed, and thankful for it. A typical day was taking calls non stop, some customers were better than others. Resolving their issues makes everything better than when it started. The most enjoyable part of the job was resolving issues, and the patient acknowledge your time and effort to help them get their medication."
bad,"The culture is dysfunctional reinvented. The company is recognized for being the leader in work from home yet no one is allowed to do it.  if you need to work from home due to a sick child or a catastrophe (broken water heater and flooding), congrats - you just earned yourself a mandatory day off.  No flexibility whatsoever.  Also, don't expect to get a raise. there are people here for 8 years that have never seen a raise.  And bonuses??? if you are eligible for one, you will never see it."
bad,"Poor job culture and management."
bad,The most difficult part is learning all the required information and screens within a couple weeks.  The compensation is low for the amount of information your responsible for.  HR lied about the starting compensation after training to get you in the door.
bad,"Poor Pay, work environment is extremely unprofessional despite claims by management to the contrary.  No support from management.  Poor computer equipment."
bad,"I was one of the first people in the class for the new sams club project and anyone that started with me at xerox is no longer there, u believe we were the guinea pigs if you wiill for the operation and they have alot of growing to do"
bad,would prefer to not be on the phones anymore .. the calls are draining emotionally and mentally ..
bad,"I learned standard and expedited cases, through a very basic and quick training."
bad,Center closing September 30. BB discovered. Little support from management. Double standard about company policies. No raises. Poor moral of employees.  Required OT due to high turnover.
bad,"I worked there two months,  very stressful job. Little or no help from most of supervisors. If you asked a supervisor for assistance they were quick to say call your senior team. What heck is a senior team?"
bad,The schedules were not where you can go to church if you are an church goer and they were very unprofessional as far as management and employees.
bad,"Crazy hours, it feels like being in prison. Were being watched like a hawk all day. Can barely talk. Get written up for crazy reasons and lied to."
bad,Call center environment. Customers really nasty and rude. Management sucks. NO RAISES!!!!! NO ADVANCES!!!! BENEFITS SUCK!!!  You will start as a temp with the fear of being fired at any second then if you make it to the green badge you get stuck!! Dont apply unless u just need quick legal money. You will cry every day on your way home from work  turnover is HORRIBLE!!!!
bad,"Too many delays on correcting benefits issues."
bad,I took this for income however the working conditions are not good. Poor management
bad,Management at Xerox does not receive corrective action for any mishaps. Management does not offer any kind of support to employees.
bad,"Collaborated in administering 401K and retirement accounts for Hospital Corporations of America (HCA) over 200,000 employees annually."
bad,Leuk bedrijf maar helaas niet vele mogelijkheden om jezelf snel te kunnen ontplooien
bad,Not a good job fit and looking for good compensation and stability.
bad,"The job it self is pretty chill and easy going. Very repetitive work. Flexible schedule for college students. A few nice supervisors, one supervisor yells constantly. Woman in workforce is super rude. The worst pay I have ever made. Plenty of overtime. This is  not much room for advancement. Need more than one job working here. Annoying people. Co-workers are nice. Seniors be on a powertrip. Never any certainty, when something changes there is no memo of it and when you ask one supervisor they will tell you something different than a different supervisor. Very unprofessional place to work. Did I mention the rude people? Would never recommend anyone to work here."
bad,"They lure you in with promises of $14 to $25 an hour, then after training they tell you the truth. You can make that much if you take that many calls in an hour... When dealing with Federally funded Loans its rally not possible, and to maintain the level of customer service they expect. Management doesn't seem to care whats going on as long as you are taking calls."
bad,"For me, a typical day at Xerox was very redundant and repetitive.  I learned a lot about the types of data field on a medical and dental claim form.  Management was not good--always negative feedback to the team.  When productive goals were not met, manager had a very bad attitude.  Not much interaction with co-workers, given the production environment we were not allowed to interact while working.  The job wasn't hard at all, I really enjoyed the work not the company."
bad,"poor management, poor staffing techniques, poor training enviorment"
bad,Answering inbound calls. The hardest part of the job was listening to complaints and not being able to resolve them in some instances. This could affect my pay on a daily basis. I enjoyed my co-workers.
bad,"Worked in a Raleigh call center (Sumner Blvd location) on a new project and it was a train wreck from the beginning.  There is basically no management at all.  There is no recognition for hard work.  We were promised bonus pay from the beginning, based on our production, but this never happened during the 18 months of the project."
bad,Good working experience and learned a lot yet company management decisions left bad morale within the company.
bad,"No comment, I do not wish to commment on my experiance at this company as I am desperate to be able to give my notice. This is the only job I have held in my entire adult life in which I seriously considered leaving with no notice given. "
bad,"Don't work there. If you want a fair and balance work environment. Seek elsewhere. I have never worked with a company that is so out of touch. Too many employees ( Management and Supervisors) getting away with so much. They fired one Supervisor due to a complaint that was conspired against him and was false. He was falsely accused of harassment by two of his agents after they were disciplined. If they took the time to speak to his fellow co-workers. From Supervisors, Management, and agents on the floor. Other than the accusers close and best friends. They would have noticed. He was an asset and not a risks to the company. I do forgive those who were involved."
bad,I felt as if they had poor management staff as well as a crumbling training dept. Every day we would be told different information and our schedule would change weekly. just not a company I feel comfortable going forward with.
bad,Mind you this is a contract position but things are so unorgainzed. They hint at things that are coming but won't let you know until the day of or the day before.
bad,every day is a typical day at my work.
bad,"If you are looking to get a calling center job and know what you are signing up for this place might work for you. There are a lot of friendly people with positive energy that try to make this stressful and not so pleasant job fun. If you do the job right, meet the statistics requirements and don't take irate customers personally, it is not so bad. There is a huge cafeteria with pool table."
bad,"A typical day at work is speaking on the phone to diverse customers and handling complaints, troubleshooting devices, taking payments, and assisting with basic device usage. I have learned about cell phone and I-pad technology more at this company than I would have anywhere else. I have had the opportunity to train store employees over the phone when they call in for assistance. Management is supportive, however they appear to be unfamiliar with state and federal employment laws. My co-workers are personable and nice to work with and associate with away from the center. The hardest part of the job is communicating with management when there is something wrong. Finding a supervisor to speak with is difficult and they do not seem to be available when needed. The best part of the job are the customers. Some call in angry and you can tell they have left with a smile. Others have quite the sense of humor. They have a tendency to make the day a little easier and make the time pass a little quicker."
bad,"I worked at the Xerox Call Center in Lacey, WA. Training was great, everyone was nice and wanted you to succeed. After training, nobody cares about the employees."
bad,Not an engaging environment
bad,Highly work intensive. You are expected to work 3 to 4 different full time jobs in one 8 hr day. Lower management is incompetent. There are processes and procedures in place to stifle advancement. Co-workers are great. Hardest part of the job is dealing with management.
bad,Taking calls for Sam's Club. Management was laid back however when it comes to taking children to hospital and them not being admitted was given points lost pay and affected any bonuses at the end of the next month. There is a lot of favoritism.
bad,Lies Lies Lies
bad,"Very bad management, unfair treatment, too high expectations for the job with lots of statistics, GPS monitoring, and so on. No way to get promoted unless you suck and leak the manager. Typical American corporate culture where you are just an employee number. They will kick you out before retirement or force you to a bad settlement. If you are unlucky to get involved in an traffic accident during work time, say good by to your job, after getting rehabilitated they will let you go, somebody else got the job already."
bad,"It was a joy to get up each day and go to work at Xerox. The work space was clean and organized. The training was exceptional. You do not have only a single trainer, but they have you work with a different professional for a few days during training. You not only get to know your co-workers, but you get a sense of how each person works the particular position and gain a style of your own."
bad,"Our training was suppose to be 6weeks however because of Open enrollment start date was approaching we got thrown on the floor then after the close date we were put back in training with the worst trainer ever. Then again thrown on the floor. When asked a supervisor for help was told call senior team, senior team said isn't there a supervisor on the floor to help. After that call I signed off the phone and walked out. the"
bad,"Deplorable conditions at work site, outdated office equipment, broken toilet facilities, uneducated/under educated management, no room for advancement, HR Supervisor less than welcoming for new employees, no appreciation, no recognition, investors lack knowledge of current market conditions and how this negatively affects the customers"
bad,Wasnt a good work environment and I didnt like it and was very stressful. Was good money. Coworkers were very disrespectful and the quotas were very very high
bad,"Xerox has changed immensely in the past 2 years.  Beginning with the split into 2 companies (Xerox and Conduent), then complete overthrow of the existing board of directors, CEO, CIO and CISO.  The print industry is shrinking and Xerox is shrinking along with it."
bad,"Working @ Xerox in New England"
bad,I would perform break fix of high end Xerox copiers.  I went through all training successfully however I soon found out from technicians with many years of experience that they were all looking for work elsewhere because Xerox stopped giving annual raises several years prior to my being hired.
bad,Current State at Xerox is very poor due to the recent restructuring and unknown future.  Too many people are retiring or leaving for new jobs.  The management is not backfilling critical jobs and that leaves those left to fill the void.  They are not qualified to do these jobs.
bad,"New board in the US are unfortunately making their way over to the UK.  Jobs are being cut left right and centre. "
bad,Xerox is reducing its operations in order to secure a new owner.  No investments in technology or employees.   New operation site in Guatemala to handle all back-office operations and US-based employees are being terminated.  No new technology
bad,"Een leuke baan, maar slechte arbeidsvoorwaarden en weinig tot geen vertrouwen in de capaciteiten van het management."
bad,"All employees are well trained. Training is on going."
bad,This job has no flexibility for new mothers or childcare. You must meet a timed problem-solving program with each customer and are rated and reviewed for each customer.
bad,"Xerox has same reasons as Sitel poor management, no room for job advancement, not enough hours as well as rate of pay. Their needing to change the way they do business to satisfy customers. Always remember customers comes first."
bad,"It was ok.  I would not go back. It was stressful and management was not the best.  I would not return, but from what I know it doesn't exist int the location I was in any more."
bad,You are constantly fearing about your job no matter how you are performing.   No one is safe.   Company lays off small number of employees many times a year.  Commissions decrease every year.
bad,the pay kept changingand the managers above my supervisor didnt care about what we could do but what we didnt do. christopher mood made life hard and enjoyed being mean
bad,"Stressful work environment with high turn over.  Over 10,000 employees through the doors in 3 years time.  Some people working there were great, others not so much (referring to agents and management alike)."
bad,The pay was lower than other call center jobs. You are not given sick days but after 90 days you do start to accumulate paid time off but for a week of work you might get 2 hours of paid time off. Advancement for those who have friends or family that work in management.
bad,"The recruiting and interview process was structured to create a feeling that the sky is the limit and that advancement and longevity were possible.  That is misleading.  You are advanced and you build tenure from who you know, not what you know.  There are political factions and networks within Xerox that preclude anyone from advancing."
bad,"Basically worked in a call center, troubleshooting for the client. The job itself was ok. Upper management was terrible. If you're an agent on the phone, they would bend over backwards to keep you. However, they'd do this at the cost of stepping all over other agents. There was no support for supervisors, and they only cared about numbers."
bad,"I love my employment and helping the citizens of Indiana. I learn a lot in my role on a daily basis and learn something new all the time. I love my co- workers and my team. Management could be better they like to micromanage, your limited to 6 minutes to use the restroom on daily basis, and they are just not the friendliest people and don't interact with employees at all. All rules are in a very gray area and never in black and white. The most stressful job I have ever had. The hardest part of my employment is when clients don't qualify or are being discontinued for benefits. My passion for the citizens of Indiana is very high and I try to help everyone fairly. I enjoy the moments when I am able to help our clients and they are more than appreciative. Just knowing that I am able to help lift a burden is the most joyful feeling."
bad,"I do not wish to leave a review, I haven't been at this company in years and my experience there may be different than how the company is running currently."
bad,"Training Supervisors were good. Once you get on the floor, your experience can be based on your immediate supervisor.  Mine was horrible and so full of himself, The people calling in seemed to think they were entitled to scream at you and call you names.  Nothing really good to say from my perspective."
bad,"While working for Xerox it was a call center for Verizon. It was the typical call center. A lot of employees, very little management or help with difficult questions or customers."
bad,applied for an entirely different position than what was offered. Very excited initially thanks to the trainers. Pay didn't reflect job skills and requirements.
bad,"The system our team worked on for the last 2 years that I was there was outsourced to another company to create a new system.  Our team was the support for this system without training of the new system. Before the new system was written, our team supported the Legacy system by modifying programs, testing the programs and working with the client to implement the changes. The most enjoyable part of the job was finding the solution to the clent's problems and making the modifications to correct the problems."
bad,"Doesn't matter where you end up, anywhere is better than here.  Poor training and zero development opportunities. Management acts like a bunch of headless chickens, don't even know how to accomplish the basic of tasks. Uncoordinated, unskilled & rely on underlings to do all the work. Losing contracts due to poor performance and escalating costs, due to poor project management."
bad,"No job security, no collaboration, the workplace culture terrible. Everyone for themselves, gone are the days of team work. I learned that even great companies can be mismanaged and sink like the titanic."
bad,"I was contracted through Xerox and placed at a major tech company in Silicon Valley.  My review is primarily based on management.  Manager was inappropriate, unqualified, and eventually let go, but replaced with someone who was only seen once every 90 days or so."
bad,It great company to work for in the start of my career. there were lots of opportunities for training and job promotions. as time went on and business got tough they started to lay off and ask people to do more and more work.
bad,"What I noticed most about working at xerox is the was a lot of drama with the managers, and between employees. I worked here during my pregnancy and HR lost my ADAAA paperwork from my doctor so I was going over my break time due to using the restroom, being ill at work and how long it took me to get from place to place from 6 to 9 months pregnant. Overall I was not impressed but it was decent pay for as stressful as the job could be."
bad,"Learn and grew with Xerox, excelled and promoted several times within my department. Advanced to team lead and Social Media Specialist. Enjoy working with my team and leaders."
bad,"Management not supportive, no monetary growth, not enough work to keep you busy, not a team player environment, pay is low, the most enjoyable part is the people"
bad,i liked my job but i had travelling issues and they would not work with me to give me 1/2 hour to get home and catch the last bus even tho i would go in early and put in 2 extra hours
bad,"With the changing culture Xerox is out sourcing it work, making it stressful and hard to meet the metrics. Xerox is out to 3rd party company.  Because of this they or reducing their work force in this area."
bad,"Assist Active/Retired employee's with withdrawals from 401K Savings Plan. "
bad,"O melhor que a Xerox tem é a sua área técnica que foi o TRUNFO de todo seu sucesso comercial."
bad,"Don't work here!!! The management is terriable!! No culture here. The restrooms are nasty, so were the workstations. Crawling with bugs!!. Wildlife to get you in the parking lot."
bad,A typical work day is high call volume from angry customers in which we aim to satisfy. It's all about knowledge of the job and satisfying the customer to there satisfaction . Which is primarily my favorite part of my day a happy customer. The hardest part of the job is obviously not being able to satisfy a customer. Having to send them to a supervisor after trying your best to help them. I think there could definitely be a higher level of training and knowledge of the system before being placed on the floor
bad,"Primary management style at this Xerox/Conduent center was ""management by crisis"". Everything was reactive and nothing was proactive. As a result, the client we were working for was prepared to pull their contract. Xerox/Conduent forestalled that by closing the center with an effective date of 06/23/2017."
bad,"Was able to work from home for several years; A good place to work as long as you were able to work independently.  There were no raises for many years, but being able to work from home made it almost worth it. Jobs gradually started to move to India, and management was non-existent, which was not always a bad thing. People should have started leaving years ago when the writing started to appear on the wall.  Loyalty bought no one anything at this company.   Loyalty goes only one way.  If you are still there, hanging on, get out before they show you the door. There will only be more competition out on the street when you look for another job."
bad,Hard to get things done with so many layers of management to go through to get any approvals. Always concerned about when the next round of layoffs will be or the next hiring freeze.
bad,"main duties of ops is to scan hard copy documents into electronic copies"
bad,"People are nice. Unfortunately, leadership is trying to figure out the business strategy. There were several re-organizations last year. However, business was not picking up. They merged a new company and then having at least one laid-off every quarter. I am not convinced the leaders know what they were doing."
bad,"Sales oriented"
bad,As a customer service rep you will handle phone will customers. A large factor in your responsibilities is which project you are working on. They have multiple clients which range from Verizon Wireless Prepaid customers to higher end business clients.
bad,"To be honest, being the lead Trainer was not all that bad, besides the 90+ hour work weeks. In order to make sure I could train my classes as well as review other trainers, I was working 5:30 AM to almost midnight for weeks. "
bad,"A lot of telling you what's wrong, but not a balance with what you are doing right."
bad,"This opportunity was to build my skills and learn a new trade. I certainly got thrown into the deep end quickly, and had to learn to swim because there was a lot to pick up in such a short amount of time."
bad,Work is good. Smart products are developed. Culture is not good. My office location does not have good management. Very much lacking in taking care of employees.
bad,"Xerox is an okay place to work at. You get to sit down all day, but the management could definitely improve. I was taking college classes at the same time while working at Xerox and the management wasn't willing to let me do part time even though there were people who worked there who only worked part time. I didn't feel like they really cared that I was trying to further my education and I didn't feel like they cared about me as an employee. The work is very tiring and can be stressful some days."
bad,"Call center was alright on a day to day basis, you really cant converse with other work members, management was constantly busy and barley has time to tend to questions or concerns you may have. Hardest part was dealing with upset customers if you're not use to be talk to like your lower then dirt."
bad,Xerox has a high turnover rate because the way they handle business isn't the best. You're treated as just another body in a seat because you can be replaced just that easily. People usually don't work for this company longer than six months.
bad,"A éviter dans la mesure du possible."
bad,"just did a review on this job."
bad,"We were not informed that our jobs were temporary until we got to training. The training we received for telephone enrollments was lackluster. The environment was very unprofessional and Managment was not organized. Shifts were rotating only for certain people therefore it was difficult to plan anything, if you were one of the unfortunate ones to get that shift. Others were able to enjoy consistent days off for reasons unknown. As grown adults, we were treated like children and policed like criminals on a daily basis. The only upside to this job is that it was fairly easy and it paid well above minimum wage."
bad,"I have worked for this company on two occasions and my expectation was higher the second time around. The company has a high attrition rate due to job dissatisfaction and low compensation."
bad,I did not like the location. The upper management was very rude. I would not recommend this job. It is not what it appears to be.
bad,"My experience with Xerox was not a good one, there is no structure, growth opportunities. The hardest part of leaving Xerox was the agents."
bad,"Overall working working a great team of people makes the your job so much more enjoyable and a manager that supports you,"
bad,"Xerox is a great place to work if you are trying to find stability. Being that my location was new, it was not as organized as an organization should be."
bad,"Teaching customer service employees to ""fake it"" was not close to what I expected to be exposed to as my expectations from 30 years of providing client facing customer service would never place the wrong resource, person, in support of customer issues."
bad,"This job is great for a first job. it's a highschool environment where everyone of the employees act like teenagers. it's full of favoritism and dumb politics. but you know what you're getting into when you get into training. "
bad,management in the dumps typical work day is drama drama drama. coworkers are young and dumb. Hardest part is the staff not being organized and not being able to effectively do your job because you dont have access to the proper systems
bad,"Its a job stop gap aka temp job.  The managers are not creditable, inconsistent and not accountable. It pays the bills though. ACS Hou - Always Changing Shhhh.."
bad,"The pay is ok, but it is not worth the stress they are expecting from the workers. They will change your schedule at the drop of the dime, and let you know the day it changes or after it changes, and you have no choice but to adjust to it. Having a life outside of the job means nothing to management. You are given no choice as to what goes on at the job."
bad,"Xerox is not a job for anyone with work history. It is setup for first time job works. The pay is very poor and they find ways to not pay you. They mainly have contracts with other companies and those companies pay Xerox well but not the people doing the work."
bad,Not a Professional place to work. Poor Language by staff as well as Supervisors. Daily Mechanical Failures as well as Technical Duties. No on site repair personnel. Each Document Imaging Specialist is required to work on and repair Machinery without proper training. Workday is limited from one hour through 12 hours of work without notice
bad,"Los altos dirección cultiva el clima de la desconfianza que se traslada a todos los niveles de la empresa."
bad,Xerox was a company that was mainly geared towards making sure that deliverable got done at whatever the cost. Xerox is under new management since I worked there so no further info is available.
bad,"Slow paced with little or no room for advancement in the company, a CEO with only a 25% approval rating from employees is indicative of the management style. Managers are hired from sales and know very little about the work at hand."
bad,You will be handling outrageous customer calling about there bank account(mainly customers in California). Too stressful for the pay. Lunches and breaks are timed. You will be trained fast.
bad,"Poor:"
bad,"Was assured of a better shift preference, but after 6 weeks was told I would be assigned to a graveyard shift.The company does not keep its promises."
bad,"I worked there 7 months, and out of a training class of 36 I was one of 6 who took the floor after training, 4 that were still there a month later, and 3 that were still there 6 months later. Here are some things to know:"
bad,"I've spent 5 years working for Xerox/ ACS.  I wouldn't wish the job on my worst enemy.  There is practically never room for advancement because the company would rather hire management off the street then promote from within.  This is a company that is fractured doesn't even work well with it self.  I've personally known someone who worked for an entry level department making $10 hourly, apply for another department that pays $16 an hour and be offered that position, only for their current department's Operations manager to block their transfer.  If your ambition ends at $10 an hour taking phone calls in a center with a factory job mentality this may be the job for you.  Otherwise steer clear."
bad,"Well known corporation which allows contract vendors to dictate lack of pay unless quality is 100%. While doing same work as contact employees who do not have penalties for errors within casework, while Xerox will decrease in hourly wage if quality is not at 100%. Often correcting the vendor workers errors while Xerox employee has to made pay grade in order to maintain hourly wage plus giving credit for tasks performed. If not performing up to grade can make decrease in hourly pay. Skill based pay based on tasks performed and quality score of the tasks performed. Unfair hiring practices and advancement based on who is known within organization. Stressful work environment while performing tasks over and over again on daily, weekly, monthly, yearly basis."
bad,"Honestly, the only good thing I can say about working here, especially 3rd (graveyard) shift is the fact that when I'm home, no one else is and I can get uninterrupted sleep. There are the expected few that you can actually befriend, depending on your function. But that's about where the positives stop. "
bad,"The day was very busy day and full of different people, the agents came to work at 6:00 am and they took inbound calls and payments form the customers. I often had to check the time and make sure they did not have any questions on any new plans that may have changed .And any new equipment has changed and train them on the new material in the next 30-90 days. Co-workers were a pleasure to work with and I enjoyed when the customers were happy and my agents were happy as well. I really enjoyed talking to different people all across the USA. and Canada and Mexico . That was the highlight of my day."
bad,"Production is different than training, the things that you learn in traing changes daily. You are paid per task and you are QA. whick with thing changing all the time can changed you pay."
bad,"first working experienced gain in this company, very small office,     a lot of rules and regulation. very typical workplace that i have worked."
bad,"Everyone starts out as a temp. If you're lucky, you'll become a permanent employee. Great place to get some experience to put on your resume. Decent pay. Ok, benefits. Mandatory over time from about November-February...working 6, sometimes 7 days a week. (Those OT checks do look nice around the holiday)They don't care about your home/personal life. And don't even think about saying you can't come in. They give you an occurrence for coming in late, calling in, leaving work a few hours early. So if you have a family, or young kids this is NOT the job for you! Not allowed to use your personal cell outside of break/lunch period. So again, if your kid is sick or hurt at school, you won't know until your break or lunch time. Can't go to your car outside of break/lunch time. It's literally jail that pays you between $14-16/hr. There are days when there isn't a lot of work. Management expects you to sit and not talk to your neighbor or surf the internet for your whole 8 hour shift. Can't take a walk around the building...nothing! Just sit for 8 hours! Luckily my co-workers are awesome! We get each other through the days."
bad,"Upon entering training we were told out base income would be $10 per hour plus bonuses based on performance and attendance. The base pay has not increased above training pay and bonuses are null upon 1 excused absence, also no one in our project has access to their time clock sheets."
bad,"I recently moved to NC so I was not aware of the reputation that the company had, I am sorry that I was not. The work place was very unprofessional and there was no opportunity for growth. I would not advise anyone to work there unless they are in drier need for a check, if you would consider the pay there worth the headache."
bad,There is not a lot of professionalism here and its very hectic all day. would not recommend to anyone who has a family to care for.
bad,"Unprofessional, low wages and dealing with customers who devices aren't working right but still supposed to get a great survey."
bad,The hardest part is working in a call center.  Reading only a script a computer could have done since we were not allowed to think.  Andy Cotter of Goodwill KY said I have set the record of working in that type of Call Center for over six years.  No one will ever match my record.  I liked working at home but now I need to physically move around a lot more.  Sitting for eight hours is not good health.
bad,"Apple excellent, but Xerox pay very low not adequate chairs for back to sit for 10 to 12 hours.  Money oriented will tell apple anything to keep vendor, promised 500.00 bonus for meeting quotas never paid!"
bad,Management Lacks Communication Skills. Also they worry to much about client and less about client customers. The do not care about employees
bad,"I've been working for Xerox/ACS for 8 years and have never received a pay raise.  I don't know of anyone here below supervisor level who has received a pay raise whether they've been here for 2 years or 20 years."
bad,"I must admit that I'm a bit jealous of some of you who've had great experiences with Xerox. I wish I could say the same...."
bad,"My site was a vendor for Verizon Wireless. It is important to know this because as a third party, you should be able to act as the customer advocate when there is dissatisfaction with a store experience or their contract expectations. The metrics that Verizon Wireless sets that deem a site ""successful"" are unrealistic unless they retrain their own direct employees and indirect contracted stores and punish some very unethical behavior. As an agent, your pay is based on the ownership you take in resolving a customer issue and your demeanor during that call. You are surveyed up to 3 random times a day. The culture at this site is once you have your 3 surveys in, the two metrics that matter most are disconnects and credits. Those are the two metrics that affect supervisor and OM bonuses, so they take precedence over disconnecting a line that a store employee ""forgot"" to disconnect when the phone was returned within the worry free guarantee or crediting back the line access that was charged for an opened line that a store employee received a commission for but that the customer knew nothing about. You will be encourage to offer ""suspending"" the line to keep your OM team metrics in an acceptable realm so that the disconnect is passed to somebody else who will do the right thing and take care of the customer. Want to advance? If you are not below 1% in disconnects, this will not happen. A true leader would listen to the pattern in disconnect calls and renegotiate this metric and point out that the client's direct employees need to go through retraining. But Xerox does not promote leaders."
bad,A new project with Google and was not well established. Poor management. I enjoyed my work hours. I was allowed to do overtime.
bad,"Xerox had some good co-workers at my level. However, the management was terrible. Worked as a customer care rep and was told that the customers problems were less important than what I could get them to buy, to the point that I could get fired for not selling them enough, even though I wasn't in sales."
bad,"This place is like working in a Third World Country. You get paid just over $9 and hr to deal with Sprints Irate customers all day. You are contently watched and plugged into a meter all day, and if you fall below the metrics, they take you in the back room and scold you like a child.  Short 10 min breaks and very long days. You can't even leave your desk to go to the bathroom. If you have high blood pressure then you may want to avoid this job."
bad,i was a temp but it was awful. the pay was terrible. they didnt care about you at all. i was moved around at least 4 times. the people i worked with were nice but other than that i had a terrible experience.
bad,very unprofessional place to work.  The only reason I stay there is for the medical benefit.  Im looking for a ne experience.
bad,"Understaffed"
bad,A typical work day involved being able to multitask several different job task at any given time and being able to keep things organized.   Need the ability to self manage and good communication skills with co-workers as well as management.   The hardest part of the job is communicating with upper management about unrealistic job expectations/task for providing quality work.
bad,helps to pay the bills. not where you want to retire or call a career. no promotion from within and no pay raises or cost of living increase in 3 years - across the board. refusal to close call center during blizzard.
bad,"This was a seasonal job, even though I was advised upon hire that I would be employed from September until March of the following year,they released all the benefits specialist including myself in the last week of November. It was clear that we were not valued employees, as we did not get any benefits, we were constantly being sent home early due to low call volume and the management very rarely communicated with us at all. When we were released we were not even given the courtesy of knowing what we could have done to increase our success in the position. From what I am told this is routine for Xerox. Many people have gone through this routine for four years or more, awaiting permanent positions."
bad,"I was given the impression there would be room for advancement in Xerox.   I am disappointed to learn that that does not exist."
bad,"I will say that I sincerely did enjoy my job, however it has gotten to a point where there is not a standard of expectation or consistency. Moving up with a promotion is based off of favoritism, the main point that is stated about Xerox when an individual is hired, is that hard work pays off but in the time that I have spent there I have not seen that action be reflected. It was a lovely employer 2 years ago, beyond that point, however, is no where I would recommend. There is a terrible turn around and it is clear to the reason to be the establishment as a whole and how it is run."
bad,"I do not encourage anyone to work for Xerox located in Cary, NC. The management is horrible the pay is not worth the effort and the people are NOT PROFESSIONAL! If i could post a sign on their page of careers it would be DO NOT ENTER."
bad,stressful place to work with very public reviews of your performance
bad,"It is extremely unfortunate to work for a large corporation where employees are made to feel invaluable. The turn over rate is through the roof as there's no job security, poor compensation (not even a cost of living raise) and poor managerial skills being displayed by the majority of the management team, no pension plan and horrible healthcare benefits."
bad,"The company was fairly interesting in structure. However it is very unorganized considering there's such a high level of professionalism that is required to go into the job."
bad,"Treacherous, backbiting, and very unprofessional.  Hsted it."
bad,typical work day taking about 50 inbound calls daily..i learn problem solving and issue resolution.team leader also was also invole in taking sup calls
bad,Great place to get trained but the training doesn't continue. sink or swim type job with no culture. the structure wasn't great either.
bad,"Fiquei apenas um dia pelo fato de estar fazendo faculdade no horário do trabalho ,o que não era viável a eles."
bad,"Because they are paid by their client in a certain way, they directed their agents to handle their calls in a certain way in order to reflect the metrics in a way that would get them paid more. I found it dishonest and became very problematic."
bad,"A typical day would consist of answering calls, helping customer track orders, and order new prescriptions. You were mostly dealing with mostly elderly customers, who tend to get irate rather quickly. Management was poor, and the work environment was less than professional. They would change your schedule last minute. I remember during training we came in, and that same day they let us know we would be in training for 12 hours. Once we hit the floor and started taking calls on our own you would be given mandatory overtime with poor notice.  They sometimes make you work through your lunch break; the only plus being that you are provided lunch, but you will be still taking calls while trying to enjoy your lunch. The job is not very stable; on any given day the ""campaign"" could end or you could get fired due to quality. If you have other obligations, such as kids, another job, or anything else, I would not recommend this job for you. They fail to realize that people have a life outside of work."
bad,Responsible for repairing office equipment for a hospital with a team.
bad,"I have been working at xerox for about a month now and I have to say that it is by far the most unprofessional and dirtiest call center I have ever worked in my entire live. I just finished this boring five weeks of training and start taking live phone calls for Verizon Wireless customers on Monday. For what what we have to know and do, xerox pays us popcorn money. The some of the people in my training class was unprofessional, disrespectful, and just down right rude to my trainer. The training was more book work than hands on. If you fail an assessment, you get a final written warning. If you fail another assessment, you will be fired. You have to get an 80% on the test or higher. Since Verizon is a new client for xerox, I hear ops managers telling us that it is a lot of opportunities to advance into a higher position but that's not that easy is because one, it depends on your current supervisor. If you have a bad supervisor or is not one of the favorites, the only way you're moving into another position is if you leave the company. I was told by another person from another training class that they fired over 400 people within the last year. I don't expect anything from working here. I will just keep my nose clean and if the job is getting bad, I will job ship before they get rid of me."
bad,El clima laboral es relativamente bueno  pero las exigencias no van        acorde con lo pagado  .-
bad,"Working at Xerox in the beginning was great, new environment, fun. "
bad,Hardest part of this position is the entry level sales prospecting.
bad,"* Rather not say."
bad,this job was very difficult on a regular basis. It was constantly changing which made it hard to give accurate information. I really didn't learn much at this job because I was not properly trained when I was put out into production. Management needed some work there was not very good communication. The people there were awesome and all did there best but again it was hard to work. the constant change made this job hard. The most enjoyable part of this job was talking to the customer.
bad,"Typical day at work:"
bad,Looking for a place to grow this is not the place and the manager there has no experience to teach you nor does she care. You have to be assertive to ask for training or help. otherwise they will set you up to fail. Jamaica is the only place that can help you with knowledge to do your job. otherwise management there is clueless. No support from upper management or team. Very frustrating if you looking for stability and possibly to grow. Old system nothing advanced.
bad,"Busy, busy, busy, meetings, new contract, new management."
bad,"Underpaid at start. Lost weeks of vacation. No raises for 4 years. Periodic unpaid furloughs after hiring six managers.  Fired three people and solicited for the same job two days earlier."
bad,"For it to be such a huge corporation, the training is not sufficient."
bad,"Minha avaliação tem pontos positivos e negativos,vamos começar pelos pontos positivos é uma empresa de grande porte com vários clientes tanto no Brasil como na Europa,foi a primeira empresa que trabalhei com carteira assinada tem bons benefícios, agora vamos para os pontos negativos na minha opinião grande rotatividades de supervisores em sites,poucas oportunidades de promoção."
bad,Over all not a good company. Totally manual work. Not a good growth. Not job security. Its totally different from Aon Hewitt.
bad,"The company was great to work with until we got a new GM for the contract."
bad,"Very busy, ever changing.  Oversaw facilities for complex, as well as provided administrative support."
bad,This company does not and will not show any appreciation for the employees who work hard to keep the place running despite all of the stress they receive from their clients. Pay is way low and they reward you with more work.
bad,"Training was a joke, spent the majority of the time doing nothing.  "
bad,"Xerox was a good job but not something for everyone. The managment was short staffed and not very ""manger skilled"""
bad,"This job has a grading level for the inbound calls that are taken.  The smallest mistake could cost you a lot of money off of your pay, and they do not have a base pay that you can depend on.  Some of the supervisors would degrade employees in front of other co-workers, and there was no professionalism."
bad,"They lie to you about the amount that you are being compensated, then make it impossible to make the amount that you are promised. Ridiculous that a place like Xerox can be so unorganized."
bad,"xerox, you would think you hit it big getting hired here.  well first they will not hire you direct.  you have to go through a temp service for years before they will make you a ""xerox"" employee."
bad,"I am given enough room to excel at my job."
bad,Everyday i typically handle 30 to 70 phone calls with member's inquiring about there medical benefits and i claims. I really enjoy working with claims and benefits since it is part of the medical field. It makes me happy that i can help a member completely understand there benefits before going to a provider. The hardest part of the job is there is no respect.
bad,the worst part is driving in Mumbai from one customer to another in heavy traffic jam with a commitment of attaining a service call within 2 hours.
bad,"I will come into the office with the pressure of not knowing what my day will bring. I would have make sure the customers love my responses to their issues or face losing pay. If the customers do not like the answer, they may take a servey which would dock my pay. (IE I am sorry you went over you minutes, the overage charges are lined up. We have given you credits in the past and educated you on your usage and you are not on the right plan.) They can decide we were rude and we will lose pay for a month."
bad,"Was told I would be permanent after 6 mo working 8-5. Once I accepted the job I was placed on a 11-8 schedule, lunch and breaks were taken away and mandatory 55hr plus work week was enforced."
bad,a typical work day consisted of answering inbound calls
bad,"A typical day at work includes my answering a high volume of incoming calls related to health care medical and pharmacy benefits. I recieve calls from members, providers, and other agents who need help with verifying medical and pharmacy benefits. I also help identify and resolve enrollement, billiing, and benefit discrepancies."
bad,Nice to work for a company with such a reputable name as Xerox. The downfall is the lack of culture.
bad,Life at Xerox is full of changes as is with any other company in a management role. Technical support services were provided for our customers with an emphasis on customer service.
bad,"Loved the work but the company is going down hill. Many people are being layed off and unfortunately the managers were very sneaky about it, even lying about it when asked. A typical day at work included using high volume production machines, mostly inserters and printers. My direct supervisor was a decent person and I highly enjoyed the rest of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was meeting very strict deadlines but they were always met. The most enjoyable part of my job was that my day to day tasks varied greatly."
bad,"Pay is horrible, benefits could be much better and the work is plentiful with no type of recognition except thank you that was job, I thought you were aware of all your duties. No bonus or increase during performance review."
bad,"There is a problem for the management and the owner of the company,there is no overtime for extra time and extra day of working,our co workers are all okay,we have a same concern regarding mis management,but we are enjoy in our community as a small family."
bad,The moral at Xerox is very low. Constant layoffs. Job security is a consant stress. Outsourcing has been a mainstay for about 7-8 yrs. It's unfortunate the state of the company right now. Hoping it will improve and thrive once again
bad,no raises in a very long time.  token bonus this year.  its all about the shareholder.  major layoffs every month.  no plant manager for past 6 months and current temp leader caters to his favourites
bad,Working at a place that allow the customer to determine an employee's length of employment is not ok. No matter how good of a technician you are the only thing that matters are surveys. This is if you're assigned to a technical support position
bad,The campaign Wageworks was not professionally organized at all. There was schedule changes every month which wasn’t inconsideration of those with families.
bad,Jobs are either moved offshore or outsourced to consultants.  Overall benefits and compensation decrease year over year.   Everyone is doing more than one person's job.
bad,"Very high turn around. There is real stability in this job being that certain campaigns end before it even begins. A typical day may consist of 100 calls minimum a day, you might start the day off doing on job and before lunch begins you are training for another job."
bad,"Xerox AV: My takeaway from this company was concerning - to say the least. In any sales position there needs to be significant support and structure. That wasn't the case here at XAV, disappointing but being there taught me a lot about what it means to be with a good company. Thanks!"
bad,A very impersonal work environment.  Not much personal interaction with employees.  Most every situation is handled by email.  Lacking in job security.  Constant rumors about layoffs.  Doesn't make for a relaxed work environment.
bad,"A typical day with my position a xerox was spent preparing printers for installation, systems configuration and placement of printer for installation. Management was rude and disrespectful."
bad,"No raises or bonuses unless you are management. No room for advancement since all the jobs are similar unless you want to join management. No overtime mandate. No opportunities for training, because everyone doesn't want to share their secrets to success."
bad,"Xerox was quick to train employees and then throw them into a rough nesting training course. Their expectations were high while the pay was not. Frequently trainers from the main companies Xeroxed was hired by would come in an conflict with the training we got from Xerox itself. Basically, from training to the wolves and you better perform."
bad,"A typical day at work in IT at Xerox is spent mostly in meetings if you work on projects.  Not enough time is spent actually working.  IT and Project managers are scared to death of Sr. Management.  They go to great lengths to hide/cover up any and all issues in project meetings.  Timelines are made up, and no effort is spent actually analyzing if a project can be done on time.  Project timelines are based entirely on: 1) budget; and 2) BUS schedule (deliver a project during three major releases a year); and 3) Sr. Management's desires.  My last two projects involved an Oracle downgrade (11i to 10g); and a convergence project that missed two major deadlines before it was completely cancelled after too much time and way too much money.  The culture at Xerox seems to be layoff as many employees as possible, dump the load on the remaining employees, and then threaten them if they can't get everything done on time.  The hardest part of the job is watching the disasterous projects play out.  Most IT projects end up being stripped down from system enhancements to manual work by the business users. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home for the day."
bad,"Recent changes in the industry has been a downward spiral, and Xerox has not adequately responded to meet the challenges and has failed to redefine itself in this very challenging industry.  Constant layoffs overshadowing everyone, benefits that are worse every year and shockingly bad compared to other companies, and out of date hardware and infrastructure you have to endure to get your job done, and work from home policies changing for the worse, a high stress work environment, constant outsourcing to the lowest bidder, managers and coworkers jumping ship monthly it seems, only scratches the surface of the negatives.  Profitability through cutbacks is not a long-term solution as current management seems to be chasing."
bad,"Constantly looking over your back waiting to get tapped (I was tapped twice during a 6 year period.) Used to do mass-layoffs,after there was a big one you knew you were safe for a few months. The last time around they did one person at a time for four weeks (I was the fourth,) then a mass layoff a couple months later. No strategy for replacing those let go, we'll figure it out attitude. I'd be shocked if the company survives another 10 years. Might not be a bad place to start a career as long as you don't plan on retiring from there."
bad,"Xerox/Conduent RIFed and cut people to save money. Now management is wondering why nothing is getting done. For those that were left, they didn't get raises for years and then only 2-3%."
bad,"Company focused more on spend, then investment in opportunity. "
bad,Managers were untrained and rarely helped with anything. Some management didn't follow code of conduct. Supervisers and management picked favorites and didn't help people advance based on productivity or good work.
bad,Xerox is a great place for recent grads to hone their sales skills. I very much enjoy working here for the most part. I have been able to move from outbound cold calling to my current role as a Senior Account Executive.
bad,"I was been here working more than 6 years, so I learned how to run printing Xerox, those printer very old and down , no one want to work,i have to fix printer by myself for finish the job."
bad,"Xerox State Healthcare brought the previous company which was ACS to handle NJ State's Medicaid program. Due to the privatization, pay was not commensurate on the amount of work handled. In order to grow, you would have needed to work from the main office in Hamilton, NJ. The was a huge lack of communication between employees who worked in the main office to those who worked in the satellite offices."
bad,It might be a good first job for young adults but the position I am has an 18 month contract with no health benefits and poor pay (they base off of your previous job). They don't care for their employees therefore it feels like your efforts and presence are not worth it for them.
bad,When I started there employees were valued and the management showed their appreciation for the employees. Five years later employees were just numbers and morale was non existent
bad,There is no point to write anything...any type of correspondence was ignored by management. I would have never left my job if there was some interest in the shop by my manager and upper management.
bad,Training doesn't cover many things you're supposed to pretend you know once you hit the floor.  Not enough trainers per employees when crossing into tech support leaving long waits and unhappy costumers.
bad,"Good for anyone just getting started with customer service, not really to much good things to say about the company as far as the cell phone section is concerned.."
bad,"Xerox I''m sure is a decent company to work for.. ACS however, was not. They paid the least in the area for that level of service, and the security of the data was due to the diligence and dedication of a few, and not the status norm."
bad,They're always hiring new people because they fire people at any moment . Customers treat you like garbage. They curse at you and threaten you and curse at you but if you cut them off the company takes points off your grade and ur salary drops.  This place has made me cry and gave me anxiety
bad,"Xerox was a different management structure which allowed me to hone my Supervisory skills.  My time at Xerox allowed me to look at and experience several different positions.  Starting out as an Agent and working to become a lead, Supervisor and then Site Admin."
bad,Was hired being told that the company was not a call center... Management was the worst I've ever experienced.  Employment ended because of poor management and loss of contract with CVS
bad,"Exceptional leadership in awful environment & lots of favoritism for job advancement & abuse of power. Mandatory overtime due to poor environment, poor management leadership, & just hiring anyone who walks through the door."
bad,This is not a company that values it's employees.  They expect a lot with out showing any appreciation. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unprofessional people.
bad,"The job is not terrible but it could be better. The pay does not match the workload. Some xerox sites are busier than others, I believe I have one of the busier sites. No benefits even though its a full time job."
bad,"A typical day is arriving in dreas when you arrive. When you enter everyone will be looking and talking about you pure pettiness in the air, supervisor doest speak or want to engage it anything that is not beneficial to them .. Getting on the phone being cussed out everyone that you call to help has attitudes and dont wont to be bothered from cna, clinical , and let not even speak of the stupidvisor that doesnt no anything ... Whooo glad that Im goooonnnnnneee"
bad,"Xerox is a great place if you want to be a representative for the rest of your life, there is no opportunity for promotions and management sticks together to keep representative incentives"
bad,Customers were fantastic. I have met a lot  of great people. Company is constantly going through restructuring and there is no job security.  Management focus only on making  revenue and profit plan. They do not care about their employees.
bad,"Installation, paramétrage et maintenance des périphériques XEROX, Infogérance informatique."
bad,"Xerox is currently laying off every six to twelve months. They have been since 2010."
bad,"Xerox, not a bad company to work for......."
bad,Management needs lots of improvement and no transparency in management decisions. Management try to save their buddies irrespective of their contribution.
bad,"There is zero work/life balance in this 24/7 company. Mass lay-offs have been occuring over the last few years as a result of and effort to send as much work offshore as possible, leading to a decline in the quality of deliverables."
bad,During my time working for this company I repaired and serviced multiple models of devices at various hospitals. One of the hardest tasks was driving to multiple locations .
bad,"The only positive I can offer is the paycheck didn't bounce."
bad,"Most of my time spent working at Xerox was spent twiddling my thumbs. As one of the few women in a male dominated workplace, I had to continually go to my manager to press for more assignments, more challenging assignments, so that I could contribute to the overall wellbeing of the team. Not only did I finish most of my work within the first three of eight hours, I was then expected either sit motionless in my office waiting for new work or do empty meaningless tasks such as decorating or reorganizing stock. Awful experience."
bad,"Highest turnover of any company I ever worked for."
bad,They hired several hundred people and then laid them off in months.  This looks like a trend.  They were horrible about fixing their own internal IT issues.  The pay was horrible.
bad,"need to update the computers software , no vacation time , sometimes will be working more than 50 hours a week, no vacation time, managers dont care about the employees"
bad,"No Comments, lots of changes in the organisation, support function is not that good, needs lots of improvement in each sector of the company and leadership"
bad,Its a good place to gain experience but no growth. No communication with upper management. Employees are not rewarded for their hard work. There is no loyalty.
bad,Didnt like dealing with the rude cellular phone customers and the hours were horrible to give a person your whole day is tied down to them. Pay was ok .
bad,Not a whole lot to do and there is alot of downtime to twiddle your thumbs to. Management is very nice but its usually contract so no benefits or longevity.
bad,"job itself is fairly manageable"
bad,"Room to advance, but fast paced and the faces change very often. Choices made my management were influenced blindly by those who had biased positions to only advance themselves."
bad,"Terrible training, leadership and work culture.  I did not meet one person who liked their job.  You take calls helping people with Verizon bills."
bad,The major issue I had with working for this company is the lack of respect or dignity they all allow the employees to have. The management is extremely negative to the point that you can feel it just driving onto the parking lot.
bad,"The company at first looks promising, however, opportunities for advancement do not come along that often and there are no salary increases regardless of years of service."
bad,"you need to send an email to go to toilet..."
bad,"Xerox lost their contract and had to discontinue employment for hundreds. I would rate their company a 6/10. The company was great for our community here in Bakersfield, California,"
bad,"The people here are nice when you're in training. As soon as it gets to the floor when you're taking calls, they are rude and expect you to be perfect. They say you don't read from scripts, but basically you do... If you come across an irate customer, they do little help. You better know how to de escalate customers. "
bad,This job was quite easy on how much you required to just sit around all day but the system was atrocious. The professional and just the overall urgency to like that job was pretty low. Overall pretty low basic job and lacked in how they took care of themselves and the calls that were coming in.
bad,Supervisors r rude  and so is upper management Messed over my pay on multiple occasions and now Im gone and they trying not to pay me..calling corporate
bad,"my experiences with Wds were OK, the management made you feel that you were inadequate for the job. it is a call center. i hated working there the pay was lousy the 12.25 was recently implemented as of Oct. 20th before it was 9.00 per hour. the management would claim that we were the best in the account that we worked for but the employees were not truly recognized for the efforts there was more of a negative vibe every time that you walked in the door....... we'll im sure that someone else might say other wise however my experiences were not good and i know according to the customers that i would talk to that it was the best experiences that they had however within the management i was never recognized for this it was always what i was doing wrong."
bad,I've worked at Xerox before I got pregnant which was well over a year started for Humana last October as of Today got Termed.. Their are some Supervisors there that do not need to be supervisors or head management! If your going to get Termed they can at least give a valid reason why?! However pay is decent was better at $9 than $11 due to a lot of taxes being taken out. It's called ACS for a reason Always Changing Something! So keep that in mind when you apply!
bad,"Unable to use benefits like vacation leaves."
bad,"Its non stop busy, the management does not care about your personal life. They're all hypocrites, cellphones and writing materials are all considered contraband but there is always a management member texting another. This job requires thick skin because you will yelled at and cussed out by a customer, but if you hang up on them with a manager's approval you will get fired, and the managers will critique every little part of your call to make sure you either went by the book or off script. They're all over the place with how to handle customers,"
bad,It's time I move on to something more of the challenge in life .  management care about how hard there employees works to get the job done . I love the friendly people there
bad,Management is terrible. Pay sucks. Many of the managers hire their family members and friends who don't do their jobs once hired. Many of the managers don't do their jobs either. They act like a bunch of mean girls.
bad,This is a great place to obtain experience if you are looking to start a career in the benefit administration field. But definitely not a place to retire from.
bad,"Ok place to work, nothing to brag on. Depending on your account will determine how difficult your work will be.The customers tend to treat you fair in most situations."
bad,I worked there for 3 years. And in those years I've seen very bad management. They lay you off without notice. And no raises or bonuses for job well done.
bad,A typical day is people blame you personally for their problems and then the company blames you for failing them. Then you get fired.
bad,"Werken bij Xerox is een zootje."
bad,"The training was hectic but worthwhile in terms of the sheer amount of information taught in order to perform the job. I learned several new web based systems and was tested on my competency to perform casework through a long and well supervised trial period. After doing such an incredible amount of work, I was rewarded with a (non paying) promotion to Subject Matter Expert over the pharmacy technicians on our floor. I assisted these agents with any casework they struggled with and built relationships with pharmacists to troubleshoot more effectively. Due to my leadership on the team I was promoted to Lead Subject Matter Expert, providing schedules, further training and recruiting new Subject Matter Experts to assist with production. The hardest part of the job was understanding the direction of management. The easiest was assisting other pharmacy technicians. I learned that a corporate downsizing can be a difficult part of life."
bad,"The wages are good with the ability to increase your pay based on performance with 5 hrs of overtime mandatory each week. But you need to have a tough skin and be able to be verbally abused my customers, heavy demand of calls and high stress. I am not exaggerating. I know other employees who have quit after developing panic attacks on a daily basis. I myself developed an anxiety disorder while working here. They have a quick turn around of employees."
bad,Customer care advocates need to possess great patience and communication skills working will all the different customers and members daily.
bad,"It was chaotic, high turn over and most of management looked through you or at worse at you as a number not a person. High stress environment and don't expect them to remember who you are. When I left the company they screwed up on either A. sending the message along or B. Mistook me with another employee, as they had me marked down as having left 3 days after I actually quit. When I went for unemployment and the unemployment group called them, they DID mix me up with another employee and got my benefits denied as a result."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted in audited the customers files for  the health insurance company, Humana. In this job I learned to have initiative, to have vision and provide ideas that may help to fix problems created by the system in the customers files, I also learned to live a healthy life by following the company's ""Well Being"" policy. Under this professional environment I learned to have an open communication as much with my supervisors as  with my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was the lack of personal time due to the amount of overtime that the company requested in a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job was the great team mates that I had and came to know in a more personal way."
bad,Management needs to really assess what is going on within Xerox and change the way they do business - it is currently everyone for themselves
bad,"I will always value the opportunity to learn and grow as a professional to increase my skill set. I had to learn to be adaptable since my day to day duties &responsibilities  changed daily, management was not cohesive or organized which allowed me to research, analyze and use the resources available to me and to use discernment and work  w/ little supervision .  I enjoyed helping people to obtain much needed medical assistance for their families."
bad,"Mainly data entry on computers with phone calls to MDO's to gain extra information needed to submit insurance claims for Medicare. Productivity was very important if not the most important aspect to the management. Your peers are great but there is a great disconnect between upper management and employees. You end up feeling like more of a number to them, than a human being."
bad,"This place is great if you want to get customer service experience and are starting out in the job world to gain experience, but the job is hard on people with families. You are always able to abide by their stipulations when you have a family emergency. there is no chance of a pay raise but you get all the overtime you want."
bad,"Xerox is known as a struggling company, and this is likely because the focus of the company is acquiring contracts, attempting to maximize profits, and grind away at employees with little focus on good management. Managers aren't well-trained and not incentivized to act as coaches. No advancement opportunities arise because most SBUs will combine job responsibilities for new openings with those of other managers. The work may be on the easy side, but it's usually underrated by managers (a good deal of training is still required) and no efforts are made to use management techniques to motivate or inspire employees. Compensation is usually on the high side, but benefits aren't great. Overtime arises on short notice. This job is best seen as a backup job for introverts who enjoy sitting in front of a computer and listening to music or audiobooks. Not a great place to start a career."
bad,"I worked here for 3 years, although I found joy in working with my co workers; I didn't find joy in much else. Compensation was very low for the amount of work they expected from their employees, as well as work conditions and providing adequate equipment/ time management principles left something to be desired."
bad,"The company expects a lot of its employees but does not have equivalent compensation.  The health insurance is horrible.  Most of management does not lead, but they supervise."
bad,As a supervisor I have witnessed many issues with this company. The work management is not equipped to handle work related issues and events.
bad,This is an okay place to work. They have a strange pay scale that is very hard to determine and fluctuates if you have to use the restroom at all during your scheduled shift.
bad,"I liked my job, I did not find my duties very difficult and I was always a grade A processor. Management was extremely unprofessional and would yell across the floor at someone if they made a mistake. A lot of favoritism and unfairness, supervisors had no idea how to handle personnel issues professionally. I was humiliated by management when I accessed their ""open door policy"" by discreetly reporting wrong doing by a ""favorited"" fellow coworker. I was singled out by management and as a result I walked out. Management created an en extremely hostile work environment at ALL times."
bad,"Xerox has taught me quite a lot with the offering of their E-Learning portal, and educational courses. I've enjoyed the challenges of learning to work with the state of the art equipment they've produced, and the face to face interaction with our clients."
bad,Call Center for banking system and answering calls for banking needs and taking time to speak to customer about their needs and tranfering funds to one bank to another in a timely matter.
bad,"Fun environment with great pay but does not have the supportive organization it claims to praise. All growth and development is focused on 10 out of 250 individuals which is very dissatisfying to those not included. Most enjoyable part is payday, the reason for working-to make a living."
bad,"I learned a lot working as Xerox trouble shooting cell phone issues for Virgin Mobile.  The best part of working there for me were my co-workers, as an older person I was surrounded by a bunch of younger persons who where very respectful, kind of kept me up with the times. "
bad,"When you know what client you're working with, you'd say, wow, this is going to be a good time.  Well, it was, until a couple months ago, when both Xerox and the client decided to raise the stakes for bonus so high that its unattainable for many. "

bad,Xerox is rated one of the top 10 worst places to work by TIME magazine for 2015. That being said. Keep your expectations low and your head high.
bad,"Has a high turnover rate and does not understand that you have a life outside of Xerox."
bad,"Loved the work with their Apple side as far as billing or technical support. They don't tell you that commission is based on unfair surveys (among other things). If you work well, they'll tease you with a promotion or two and then close that out all together. Chaotic management who are never on the same page with each other. Hours vary upon business needs and can be changed several times in less than a year."
bad,everyone is very childish here. the management is not professional. and everyone gets into each others lives. the store is always nessy they don't really care.
bad,"Xerox was my first job in customer service industry and will definitely be my last."
bad,"There was absolutely no room for growth. Once you are on a particular team or in a particular posituon , you could be black balled from applying die for other positions. Team members have gone from project based to full-time permanent WITH NO increase in pay and the excuse is ""Oh well now we are offering you benefits"" which makes no sense especially if the pay isn't increasing. Every changing policies, and if you want to advance you have to know somebody higher up management because they ""hook-up"" their friends with positions, whether qualified or not."
bad,they want help you if your new they have no goals set for you the qa point system sucks you will be in ojt for years its very hot in the summer time they don't believe in ac
bad,"The best part about Xerox was the people. Management was only concerned with numbers, volume, and churn. The training and preparation was inadequate and left much to be desired."
bad,"A typical day at work was to make phone contacts to teachers and district people to discover what AV needs they had and how I could assist them.  I learned a lot about AV.  Sadly, management was not in touch with the people.  Management was arrogant and I believe these factors are what led to the demise of the organization."
bad,"At this employer you were assessed on your relationship with the Manager. This is no longer the case. Making everyone accountable for their AHT, ATT and hold time.Once upon a time, we did not have a numeric goal."
bad,This location is very unprofessional and inconsistent. There seems to be no opportunity for advancement.  Also the compensation for this position is very poor.
bad,handling customer inquires with account changes and billing. they are a call center for Verizon wireless at the time. you could work as many hours as you wanted and could then control your pay check witch was nice. There is a high turn over rate because they hire at least 200 ppl at a time training is paid and if you get 2 bad surveys you are gone.
bad,Would like to see a more professional environment with management and staff. Most of the training is not done in an effective manner and positions are only based on if you can pass the test in order to have a job. Horseplay is always a factor with loud voices echoing around you when on the phone. You have no time allowance for coming in 2 minutes late it will cost you points that effect your bonuses. It will take you 6 months before the points will be removed.
bad,"Continual outsourcing  to Malaysia and Guatemala to increase the bottom line, creates no job security and low employee morale.  Administrative and after-sale support processes are cumbersome."
bad,"The lack of opportunity to advance and the inability to grow financially is the motivation for me to seek other employment. The job its self is very simple. The atmosphere is lax. There is no motivation/compensation to work harder, or go above and beyond the call of duty."
bad,Very non-professional atmosphere.  Alot of favoritism throughout call center.  Certain co-workers are always calling off...still working.
bad,"my experience with Xerox has been absolutely horrible. Im not sure if it is just my job or the entire company, but they always find ways to lower what you make. the job is paid by piece rate and any time someone makes more than what they think they should, they ""adjust"" piece rate so no one can make more than what they are willing to pay. the hours we work are so unpredictable its sad. you could work 60 hours a week or 30, so it makes budgeting a nightmare, nearly impossible"
bad,"This is the worst place I've ever worked.  That is including food service positions and other call centers.  I'll start with the training class I went through.  I did not receive a login for the tools I was expected to use until two days before training was over.  It also took nearly that long to get a permanent badge.  The questions on the written tests had many mistakes that would mislead a test taker into answering incorrectly.  To the trainer's credit, he pointed these out to the class before the test.  "
bad,"The only good thing that can really be said about the Groveport, OH PDC is that they pay well. Mandatory overtime is almost constant. Six and seven day work weeks far outweigh five day work weeks. Anything resembling employee appreciation has almost been eliminated under current management."
bad,"I went in to a 5 week training that was from 4 Am - 12 Pm. It wasn't that bad except for Management their sucks so bad you never meet your assigned manager only supervisor and everyone thinks they can boss you around still remember this encounter with a supervisor, It was my first day out of training and my shifty was over at 8 and that is when we close. I needed help with a customer that couldn't log in to his online account and asked for help from a friend standing by me, but she was busy. the SUPERVISOR HEARD NE AND OFFERED TO HELP WITH THE ISSUE. I let her know the problem was and she said and I quote "" I don't usually help people but I will make an exception. THAT WAS COMING FROM A SUPERVISOR WHO OFFERED TO HELP ME. A week after that incident I quit because I had had Enough."
bad,"Not flexible with shifts, constant overtime and if not able to work overtime consequences. Although you do learn things about the insurance world you only learn what they want you to know and are constantly changing things without update to all employers."
bad,Management is poor and low pay. Not much growth for employees and the information is constantly changing. Supervisors dont know more about the material than the agents. Training is very lack luster and doesnt prepare you well for when its time to get on the floor.
bad,"It was alright, didnt  really like it. When I worked there I was shuffled around from manager to manager. Training was cut short, and I was treated like another number."
bad,"we are required to to do to much on the phone in the short time they allow us and are penalized for their mistakes as a company, our money is taken due to simple errors they should have advised us of before it was a must."
bad,"no comment"
bad,"A day at work consisted of endless phone calls."
bad,"Thankful to have a job and that I appreciated about Xerox.  Worked there going on 5 years.  Thankful for the experience, the paycheck."
bad,Management is not good and there is no room for advancement. They don't even give regular raises. This is more of a job for a teenager that still lives at home with his/her parents.
bad,Sub par management. Lost state contract and is closing down.
bad,Xerox is your typical call center that will squeeze every dime they can from their employees as well as their clients. Any promises of benefits tend to disappear and advancement is nearly impossible.
bad,"I enjoyed my work. I never had any problems with my work. I had experience in each department as well as friends in every department. The hardest part about this job was management. Employees complained about how unprofessional they were and also questioned if the direction of our work. I worked in support which assisted customer service and patient disputes but we were told a lot to abandon our work to take customer service calls. this is good to work as a team but we would be told that if we fall behind on . This company had the following DBAs: PASC,XEROX,ACS and GetixHealth."
bad,Don't apply here unless you are into the call center environment. Same thing day in and day out.
bad,All my answers are the same as my other rating of the company on previous request for rating. All the position i have held were all eliminated except the customer service and and was told to keep my job would have to go back on the phones and take a drop i pay. we work so many hour with required ot  all year that sitting that long is bad on my health.
bad,"Good to have a job, but one will not grow at this place nor will you earn a higher compensation over time."
bad,"Training is basic based on whatever contract Xerox is tied to. They are a 3rd party administrator call center. Training is not thorough enough to prepare a person for the real job at hand. Management is young and unprepared for the stress of the job. Coworkers may as well not even be there, because there is no communication other than breaks or lunch and it is only a complaint session during those times.  Hardest part of the job is getting information and assistance to serve the customers when one is on the phone. Meeting the goals and expectations of the company is near impossible when trying to service the customer as they should be. There is no enjoyment in the job unless one manages to actually satisfy a customers needs completely during a call. As are most jobs in Colorado Springs, the amount of knowledge required to do the job and the expectations are way too high for the amount of pay.  The same job in Denver, CO would be twice as much.  Rules are ridiculous, dress code is not enforced, lacks professionalism, lacks structure, and the environment is juvenile.  The call center is like working in a high school classroom."
bad,"this work place is unorganized and unprofessional."
bad,"My typical day at work is challenging my self on how I can better serve my customer in a timely matter with complete customer satiffaction and resolution before ending the call."
bad,"Dont follow through on promises, work 60 hours a week, never home with Kids"
bad,"I have worked at Xerox for 8.5 years now. It was a nice stable place to work and though the work wasn't challenging, I really liked my job. They moved to ABC compensation and despite people's reservations it worked out well. We were making a lot of money and they were needing less people to do the work. It encouraged people to work harder. for the last two years they have been on a huge down hill roll. They have removed any employee incentives. They are now using ABC to pay people as little as possible. They have someone that specifically goes out looking for errors so we now make nothing for all the work we do. They also never replace someone that leaves and expect you to get all the work done in the 40 hour work week. What once took 5 people now only has 2 and they still complain. Rules are never followed and no one is ever reprimanded. They like to talk about what they are going to do to change things and never do. The people that don't need guidance are the ones who get micro-managed. There is also no chance for advancement here. There was a lead job that opened but with no pay increase and more hours and work. They want to pay as little as possible, treat their people as bad as possible, and get the best work possible. That just doesn't happen!"
bad,"Mgmt is horrible, a lot of new managers who do not know what they are doing especially on the Brandman Account"
bad,"It is not possible to work tech support for customers when the database used is completely unwieldy and breaks whenever it wants. "
bad,"Despite my long time employment here, I have seen many come and go. The average time spent regardless how hard you try to keep your job is 1 /12 max. Very few seniority here, and the pay is terrible with metric based wages and $2 max raise cap out. Buddies are promoted."
bad,"With a background in collegiate gymnastics and two engineering degrees, my dedication, ambition and desire to win has been ingrained in me for as long as I can remember.  It wasn't until my latest endeavor into sales, that I found out competition in the workplace was possible . . . and encouraged!  "
bad,Mostly everyone that works their is project based. The pay is low and your over worked. They don't offer any vac/sick time for project based employee's.
bad,"It is a job. Not a chance for advancement, unless someone is interested in supervising a call center."
bad,unattainable expectations of  employees. Pay based on unattainable statistics. Management ran by nice people who see to care about their employees. Co workers are mostly don't want to be there because of the stress of the job. The hardest part of the job is achieving the statistic's and calming down raving mad customers while trying to pass a survey and keep people from disconnecting a line. I like my co workers and aiming for goals. I like the reward of making  customers day by saving them money or just being there to listen and help their stress level go down by explaining things so that they can understand what's going on.
bad,"Training was a joke.  You get trained on things you never have to deal with and when you start taking calls, you have to deal with members who have requests that you have not been trained on.  Always threatening termination for violating HIPAA.  Management is scarce.  Could be a great job for someone who is ant-social since there is minimal human interaction with other humans after training. I recommend this place if you want your hopes and dreams to slowly die."
bad,This is an okay place to work.  Not much caring about personal life and other problems. All this place cares about is their scores.
bad,"In over 16 years that I worked there, many changes happened. None for the betterment of the actual employee."
bad,"Xerox manager promised me if I can help them locked in the contract for their client they will get me a full time position in the company.  After I done it, manager do not deliver the promised and lay me off."
bad,"The location on Richmond and Hayes is the worst location to work. They're consistently changing the metrics and pay, the supervisors and OM's are lazy. They have a no cell phone policy yet I see OM's and supervisors with their phones out. Its like a big high school full of immature grown ups. They've fired a ton of people for dumb reasons without warning and forcing everyone to make up the missed hours. More surveys means more No's bc there's no sups there to take escalated calls. Whatever do, don't apply at this location.  They dangle money in your face that's hard to achieve. I'm pretty sure if the whole building got a surprise drug test,  96% of the employees both upper and lower level would fail.  Everyone there either drink liquor in their spill proof cups or smoke weed during lunch. The place is very low grade and in a low grade neighborhood."
bad,"•	Design, install and configure VMware ESX, ESXi, within vSphere environments with vMotion and Experience with VMware View desktop virtualization (VDI) and Server migration physical to Virtual."
bad,"The only reason I have stayed here as long as I have are my coworkers, they are fantastic. It certainly isn't for the benefits (marginal), perks (none) or pay (on the low side). It's a good place to gain experience and then move on."
bad,I would drive from office to office cleaning and repairing the copiers. Management was based out of Austin. Hardest part of the job was when we were assigned projects there was no one to really ask questions to.
bad,Answer calls all day and resolving guest concerns or issues. Hardest part of job is getting points added for being late when you aren't late. Also hard to get assistance from Tier 3 when a call has to be escalated. Difficult to keep your QA scores up. Co-workers are helpful when problems arrive. 
bad,"This place is terrible. I worked with the Travel Customer Care side and it was the worst experience I have ever had in call center EVER. The management was terrible, the managers were not even qualified to manage a team and had no idea how to coach. the pay is terrible and they try to disqualify you as much as possible for little things so that you don't receive your incentives. (something that should be a coach-able issue becomes a Quality DQ) I would never recommend anyone to work for this portion of Xerox, Do not do the Travel side of customer service in Tigard, OR "
bad,While working with this company they would overlook you to hire there friends and family members. Work was given out to favorites and not the people that would handle it better. management is really screwed up and they are more worried about customer satisfaction then there own employees.
bad,"The management seems unsure of their job titles and how to go about their jobs. I wouldn't recommend Xerox in Memphis, TN to anyone. Not unless you want the worst job you've ever had, with the worst stress you've ever had."
bad,"My career with Xerox had help me develope multiple skills in; sales, customer service and management."
bad,taking incomming calls for verizon wireless. There is no career advancement and i worked for this company for 2 years and they are changing the pay to a lower amount would not recommend this company.
bad,Keeps you very busy answering calls. Also keeps you on your toes.
bad,Stressful work environment. Little or no work / life balance. Fifteen Reduction in Force events have occurred in the past three years. Employees overworked. Hard to succeed when employees are stretched too thin. More and more is expected each day. Low morale in the ITO division.
bad,most enjoyable part of the job was my representatives. We used to have great incentives from the Client but this was stopped in 2008 - hardest part of the job was not being able to meet their ever changing metrics on a consistent basis. Always having to contain fires instead of eliminating them completely. I liked the majority of my co workers; during the last year the highe management level lowered any loyalty I had plus they were only willing to work what the were told and not listen to any other possible solutions.
bad,I have learned how to manage my own retirement options better.
bad,"Typical daily activities include being yelled at by customers for their own mistakes or another representative's mistakes. Once the customer has been satisfied, you get yelled at by your supervisors for taking too long on the call. If your average call handle time is over 485 seconds, then your pay is reduced."
bad,"Work environment is quite flat with not real interaction among colleagues. Company requires high level of performance assigning to the single individual other jobs/tasks that originally belonged to who was in charge of that particular activity, but either has left or had to,without being replaced."
bad,"The job itself is a piece of cake. The work atmosphere is okay to be around. The politics are by far the worst I have seen with any company. Everyone is always looking for a way to get one over on the next guy. It you want to advance in the company, Supervisor is an easy goal but the last stop for most people. Its an easy promotion, however that's only due to the high turnover. Workload is way to much for only 25k a year. With the hours they demand you will be looking at roughly $7-8 hours."
bad,"The environment is clean, the people are friendly, but management and corporate levels don't seem to care about those who work ""beneath them"" other than the amount of work they can get out of them for the least amount of pay. Management is rewarded with bonuses generated within their departments by their employees, but employees never see any bonuses for their extra efforts for their hard work. There is no advancement and even management confesses there is no room for advancement or in earning more money within the company."
bad,It is not a very good job to be in becuase they is always a chang in you schedual and the benifits are not good at all
bad,The supervisors were so rude.Im hard to make cry and my supervisor made me cry twice in one day.
bad,"Call center, with no job security. Every day is differnet and you never know what you're going to be doing. You have a wide variety of people who work there. Young to old. GED to Masters."
bad,This company doesn't care about it is employees and fire people left and right and i wouldn't suggest anybody to work here. The culture is also terrible
bad,"Employees were poorly treated, disrespected and taken advantage off.  There was no appreciation shown for an individual's skills and talents.  Employees were expected to assist the public with insufficient information and little support from management."
bad,You are either laid off or saddled with the work of those who got laid off. The work I was able to do was very meaningful and important but I was caught in one of the series of massive layoffs. 125 people were walked out that day...
bad,The management is all about self and really dont care about employees. Just as long as money is going in their pockets they could care less if the reps are happy or not
bad,"Xerox itself was a good place to work for. it is just the management was not skilled to manage the site. if you were not in the click per say, you were not accepted. but overall Xerox was a great company."
bad,The location I was with closed about 2 years after I left. The employee turn around is quick but you are basically guaranteed work. Moving up is hard to do. Don't expect to move to supervisor position unless your stats are perfect it has nothing to do character.
bad,"As big as this company is, certain branches of it dont receive the same benefit and I've learned that the disabled cannot advance no matter how hard they work and show forth great work ethics"
bad,I left here because they they hired new employees and paid them more per hour than people who have been here for years. They wouldn't tell us they were hiring at higher rates and it was months and still refused to give us pay raises. Way to defecate on your loyal long time employees. I could go on but I think that says enough
bad,Career pathing needs improvement. Enthusiasm form senior leadership is missing. This isan area ofopportunity. Moarle is serverly wounded. Recogniton does not occur.
bad,"Was an okay place to work...Management had their own click that they would offer project to or promotions to and everyone else would need to be worker bees. They didn't really have time to answer questions, it felt more like a sweatshop at times and there was really no personal touch with each employee, I felt more like a body that's there to perform a task and"
bad,"A struggling organisation from the outside is a struggling organisation on the inside. Processes are very dated its difficult to comprehend it's a technology company you're working for. They still remain heavily focused on a rapidly declining market - printers! And despite calling themselves an innovative company have little knowledge on breakthrough technologies. There is very little structure or direction in place..very much a wing it attitude. Culture is quite depressing, no energetic vibes just a lot of people doing very little and waiting to be made redundant."
bad,"The job is easy, my team lead is meh, facilities are okay, salary is okay for the work load, if you're in the GY shift, bye work-life balance. It's just not for me."
bad,"At the time of my employment Xerox was under contract for Verizon wireless to be a call center for their customer service. The problem with this is the customers. Verizon Wireless customers are very unhappy. But since its one if not the biggest Cell phone provider out there. They have A LOT of business. Customers regularly call you very unhappy with there service and price. Xerox pays you based on a 1 - 10 scale of how happy your callers are. Since your pay is based on how happy you make your customers and how quickly you can do it. It creates a unhealthy work environment. Rarely does a call wrap up quickly when a customer is unhappy, and you cannot do anything to help them. Without A. Lying or B. Being honest with them about the decisions they made in store signing up with Verizon. Most times people are unaware what contract they are signing and are livid when they see their bill."
bad,Most of the non-sales and non-research jobs are outsourced to other countries.  The remaining jobs continue to be cut forcing long hours. Tenured workers go first
bad,There comes a time when revenue must be earned through the quality of the products and services sold rather than through the continual cost cutting through elimination of people.
bad,"Xerox owes me nothing. I did well there and I am grateful for all it has afforded me—both professionally and personally. "
bad,"opened center, closed center 5 days week.  worked Sundays every 2 weeks to generate payroll.  Workplace culture got better as center progressed  Originally used temp agencies for placement.  Changed to location recruitment and quality of workforce improved and turnover decreased.."
bad,"Company is all about who you know, not how good you are. Promotions given to who is in the right clique. Good place to get a job if you are desperate and don't care about advancement"
bad,"The actual work is interesting, challenging and can be fun.  Unfortunately, corporate culture is the pits, eliminating all full time employees.  Does not care about employees at all, always trying to get around commitments with the client."
bad,This place has made many bad decisions and loss many customers. It is currently on its way out of the industry. Do not expect to ever get a raise or to even be thanked for the work you have done. Management only cares about making their bonus and nothing else.
bad,"I liked my job and worked hard to exceed the expectation; however, not everyone had the same attitude for at work; favoritism always an issue in management team."
bad,"The only reason I stayed for as long as I did was the contractor we worked for and a few people I worked with. This company is fairly typical in the ways of unrealistic deadlines, cross-training without fair compensation and a few cent raises every year across the cubes. If you like doing others work who are making much more than you, go for it. Never call their HR with a complaint or you will get a backlash and they will protect their bottom line. You will not be making enough  for a single adult to live on. It's an okay job to have when you are in transition, but not a career."
bad,the management was undesirable and it was very poorly run i didnt like the lack or structure call ins were not reprimanded. nobody could fully answer any questions or concers you may have had. the company wasnt concered about  the customers or employees
bad,"Absolutely horrible and ridiculous management. Fake contradicted themselves on a regular basis. Expected The Impossible. They wanted sales to get a sale regardless of how, even if it was unethical."
bad,make sure you get everything in writing or they will give you the bare min. no training on anything manager gets mad at you when you can't complete what is asked of you due to no training and not willing to guide you
bad,"12 hour swing shifts in loud, dirty environment. Four days on, four days off. You spend hours a day with coworkers then they are the only people who have the same off days as you. Overqualified if you graduate high school."
bad,The company has gone down the drain in the last 10 - 15 years. Such a shame for the benchmark of the industry. The management is terrible and they expect too much work off the clock.
bad,"My time at Xerox started out great but once out on the floor as a Customer Care Specialist, things changed. Could not take time off with out asking permission from a supervisor. They pushed really hard for up sales and very much frowned on any disconnection of services. Every thing was micro managed to the enth degree. When a problem arose when on the phone with a customer and the rep needed help, it was very very hard to get prompt help, 10 to 15 mins sometimes. The job became very stressful with a reps every call and move being watched."
bad,Office was not manage properly and bias in a lot of ways.  Management was bias and catered to favored employees. employees were not trained and rather expected to learn on the job.
bad,"Call center. not some place that I could work for again.  The compensation changed based on customer feedback.  The supervisor was great, If I could work for him again I would"
bad,"Environment was quite stressful.  Employees were strained, unhappy and lashed out at one another rather than management.  Revolving door of staff departing without two week notices.  An unhappy place to be overall."
bad,"Management could use more training along the lines of People Skills,"
bad,Sales and customer service. Fun place to work but commission on sales would have made the pay better.  During interview was told would advance to management within first 6 months and found that could not be true because too many people were trying for management without openings. Tied to phone and expected to make quotas and offers but not paid commission. Expected to work overtime (at 2 hours every shift)
bad,"New Managers came & after a few years things got really weird. Nobody cared about the employees. It seemed as if all of the Management were trained to be cold & careless. It was so weird."
bad,not s good place to work at horrible upper management extremely messy and the contract is horrible the schedule is no good and there is no room to grow (like anyone wants to) its a revolving door and just turn the other way!!
bad,"this job is a first come first serve type of job d"
bad,full-time call center customer service. must have the ability to handle being screamed at and degraded daily. management is segmented and constantly changing
bad,"This is not a great work environment because of the constant cuts. Many, many, many, amazing and dependable employees have been laid off. It's a sad state for this company"
bad,"While working at the call center, there was no opportunity of growing to better yourself, and no communication between one manager to another manager to what the employee needs help with."
bad,"Poor pay, no advancement, and not even a cost of living pay increase to cover expenses. I've been here the better part of a decade and I have yet to see anyone get any sort of raise. Also, forget about reimbursement for training, as that never happens."
bad,Xerox te envía a empresas a representar la marca sin ningún tipo de  ayuda de parte de ellos y cuando sale algo mal lo primero que hace es echarte la culpa
bad,"Management didn't treat all employees fairly. inexperienced and lack of supervision. there was a lot of young people, fresh out of high school. environment is not for mature and serious employees"
bad,Good company to work with the opportunity to work virtually from home.  Constant change in organization lead to long working hours.  Benefits were reasonable.
bad,Company overall isn't that great to work for. Very stressful place to walk into and be in every single day. They tried to make things fun at work but it still really didn't bring up the motivation of the building to perform and be motivated every day. Pay isn't too bad.
bad,"This was a good job, providing you do not mind the looming fear of layoffs or the layers of red tape slowing everything down. An old company, not subject to change and in fact fearful of it."
bad,"Found myself in the emergency mental health unit  a couple of times and Dr. notes aren't allowed (at least not in Oregon) you have to have FMLA for excused sick days."
bad,"Stay away. The environment is toxic. Long hours, under paid. If you work in senior management, you are expected to work 12+ hours a day. I had 8 bosses in 18 months. That should speak volumes."
bad,"This was a great starter job for the call center environment for government benefits.  However, advancement was not open to many and management was not professional."
bad,great starter company that's about it the work environment is horrible. pay is not competitive. offers mostly great shifts. management not professional even down to recruiting.
bad,"Poor management. Micromanaged. Not family friendly. No more to report other than it was a workhorse environment with no motivation, no positive feedback when asked, not many pros, if any to speak of. ."
bad,Do not come to work here.  The company is going through a lot of changes and the future is very uncertain for a lot of employees.  There is not a lot of opportunity as they are downsizing
bad,"Each section of the company stays in their silo and do not communicate with each other. "
bad,This company does not follow any process in the aspect of work. Follows no proper timelines framing and does delay every time to the client. No employee beneficiary.
bad,"A very unstable company with no room to for grow, almost nonsexist  employee benefits. Very stress full environment  and very lite consideration for employees"
bad,"Xerox, or as it is known now, Conduent, is a good place to work if you're seeking an interim position to fill a void. The work is a mite stifling, and the management makes it seem as though if you so much as stand up simply to stretch your legs after spending hours in your seat, and on the phone, then you'll be reprimanded. On the topic of management, while there are a few good eggs, as one might expect, they are outnumbered by the amount of people who pride statistics over morale, and individuals whom may acknowledge that a contented worker is a diligent worker, and endeavor to further that contentment, but their workplace and management etiquette requires reconsideration. At times, given the treatment, it feels less like a place of business, and more like high school."
bad,Managers and supervisors change often as well as the whole call center having a high turnover rate. There is an overall negative environment. Management is friendly with only some people and the overall sense is a biased system. You should expect the days/hours you work to change often but not necessarily to something that works with your life circumstances.
bad,"When asked to fill in and do a far excellent job and the Company we are working for says so , not given the position but given to someone not as efficient. "
bad,"Overall, management was alright. They differed so widely that you got different instruction from everyone you talked to. The hours were horrible. I drove 45 minutes to work one way, would get there and be told to leave for an hour or two. They had mandatory overtime on days off. Would send us on three hour lunches and then the next day make us skip our lunch or take it hours late. The pay was really good or I wouldn't have lasted the short time I did."
bad,"my review of working for Xerox would be very two sided. I've been working there for little over two years. First i was contracted through Metlife through the Tricare military portion. working through this side of xerox was actually good. However a few months into working for Metlife through xerox, we were being past around from supervisor to supervisor. From team to team because they kept letting good managers go. the mangers left were very uncooperative with their employees. For example they implemented a quarterly raise, depending on your customer quality, you would either get between 10-30 cents. they did reviews (in the beginning) twice a month. The first two managers were good amount quality ratings, making sure i can improve on our overall job performance. however the manger(s) i was moved to they never did quality. I've gone six months with out one review, no comment, not even a suggestion on how to improve my work performance. Now this is just an example of one of the many things I've noticed about working for xerox. after working for the metlife contact i was then transferred to a Humana contract. i actually have a big problem with this Portion. the reason i have a problem with this portion actually started in training. this part of xerox promised a particular amount, salary wise you would receive when beginning this portion raise amounts and scheduling. Shortly after this portion began i learned that everything they promised was false. Wages, Scheduling, raises, and quality. the training managers even the SVU manager would always tend to seem hostile. I'm no stranger"
bad,"Merger of ACS with Xerox lasted roughly for 3 years. The top management carried on, some iterations in a few notorious managers' teams continued. No checks, no questions."
bad,"One supervisor says to do it this way. Another says to do it that way. You can get into trouble for not doing what a supervisor says. So what do you do. "
bad,This wasn't a terrible place to work but the hours would fluctuate so much that you never knew how long your day would be. The team leads were great to work with but upper management was complete trash.
bad,"Lack of communication and documentation"
bad,"Working for Xerox was like being back in high school. It was extremely repetitive, and everybody has to share headphones and computers, so I was constantly getting sick."
bad,"Typical work day entailed reviewing FLEX in order to know what types of jobs were slated for the day. I would setup printers, perform maintenance, load with paper and check alignments, perform quality controls and sending jobs out after finished. "
bad,"Xerox is floundering badly and is focusing on satisfying short-term share-holder expectations at the expense of both customers and staff."
bad,"Upper management is worried about upper management only. They will lie right to your face to get what they want. Your work lead and supervisor are on the phone with customers all day so you're pretty much alone, ""figure it out yourself"" kind of attitude."
bad,xerox is product based company .there is nothing much to learn because application are running on old technology. i would not suggest xerox to an experienced developer.
bad,Don't waste your time. I was there for a little over a year and the company just kept shape shifting and they constantly changed your job title and duties.
bad,They will teach you the call center environment but keep in mind they are subcontractors and have to follow the rules of the contract. there are advancement opportunities within Xerox.
bad,"Surprise meetings covering unknown topics trying to catch those not prepared. Poor training and poor motivation. If one is a mgr, decisions made are usually undercut without sufficient due diligence, favoritism is rampant and job openings are mostly already filled before hand via favoritism. Benefits only average, but pay 20% below standard across the board and bonuses reduced at will, so upper mgmt makes theirs."
bad,"Working in a beautiful building and location is one of the few highlights of this job. But the pay and management and no benefits, don't make me feel to confident about my situation here."
bad,Its good to start for a fresher. It have a good atmosphere and good working timings. The company provides supports to move on and go through your talent ...
bad,Peers and managers great to work with; we all had same goals which included supplying great customer service to our clients and their participants.
bad,"This is a bad place to work. The atmosphere, pay and people are horrible. For what you are paid its not worth being there. this place really stinks and you aren't appreciated."
bad,In the beginning the job showed great promise. It was only six or seven months into the job when it started to seem as though we would not be around much longer. And with no notice the company lost the contract and we were all laid off
bad,"Don't go into this job expecting any sort of proper up to date training or support. You get a couple weeks of training before your sent to the floor where you immediately learn that all your training is completely irrelevant to how things are actually run. Things are constantly changing without proper warning, and you're not going to be provided any sort of support from management. Expect constant negative feedback from every direction with no payoff and to be pressured to meet impossible demands in short amounts of time. You're not provided vacation time separate from sick time. So you're either worked to death until you're home sick or you're working while you're sick just because you're too afraid to lose that much needed break from this corporate soul-sucking, hostile work environment."
bad,"The worst job I've experienced. Good pay, but management and organization is horrible. Lack of communication and training. Supervisor have poor management skills. There's no order what so ever."
bad,"Was not a very good experience working for Xerox, benefits were not good, did not enjoy working there. Learned how to data entry,"
bad,Management run by politics; Team Leads sleeping next to me while I am working.  Training lacked severely within the time frame to learn.
bad,Technical support for Sprint customers. Call Center environment  with supportive training team. Turnover rate pretty high. Meet most expectations and guidelines. Not really good at up sell
bad,This company had very unethical and unprofessional ways. I was wrongfully terminated. Most employees including my supervisor was always under the influence of drugs and weren't very willing to help. I was able to learn how to work in a customer service setting and i acquired many skills.
bad,"Not enough employees to run the store, shipments were often late to stock the store. "
bad,"The training they give you is very detailed and informative, 6 weeks long and enjoyable. The stress level once you hit the company floor can cause most people to quite with-in several weeks. They have weekly meeting for each floor group to discus issues that might raise during the incoming calls and new products that were just released."
bad,Xerox acquired the business from a previous company. However the veteran employee's have not received a pay increase to compensate for the YEARS of going without. Nor hAve the employees received a cost of living raise in over 11 years.
bad,"Turned out to be a very demanding environment. After training, we were surprised to find out we all had to work mandatory overtime or loose our jobs. My direct management was okay, but they had a hard time keeping people around when they have to come around to every employee at the end of a mandatory 12 hour shift and try to convince you to work another 4 or 5 hours."
bad,"If you like talking on the phone, this is probably for you otherwise it's only good to work for a few months and save up so you can afford to be jobless again."
bad,"Decent company to work at for a paycheck. Salaries and benefits not competitive, no formal career advancement plans, it varies from manager to manager."
bad,"The call center in Yukon OK is very ghetto. Cleanliness of the building is questionable. Management never seems to be organized. Often times managers can't even be found on the call floors. "
bad,"I came from a company that compensated their employees well. When I came here, I was shocked at the salary. After all, Xerox is a well known global company. I'm trying to give constructive criticism. "
bad,"Days at work were really stressful, not the amount of work that needed to be done more like the staff/management. Management was aware of all issues but yet cared to make employees comfortable in a working enviroment. I learned a lot about medical insurances and grew stronger costumer service skills. There was a lot of favoritism and as for me it made me feel very unwelcome. overall I grew expereince and became better unfortunate i wasn't able to grow within the company but i did meet some awesome people."
bad,"Worked for call center, need to screen employees better. work environment is a joke! people arguing while your on calls, systems always messing up but your still expected to your job as if it wasn't(something you can work around, some you can't)"
bad,"Working with printers and networks is a no brainer."
bad,"While there are some benefits, such as the ability to work remotely when needed, the negatives surely outweigh the positives.  A big one is job security.  With a number of departments moving off shore you never know if yours will be next."
bad,"A typical workday / call flow was moderate, I learned a lot about payroll and benefits. Management could have been a bit better about being knowledgeable and the co workers were great and helpful. The hardest part of the job was when the call flow increased and i still had other admin duties to attend. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and co workers. There was no room for advancement; the were no raises or bonuses; management was not very knowledgeable; the attendance policy was not great; benefits could have been a lot better, and training was not good at all. Everything that you learn you had to learn on your own or through co workers."
bad,"The pay is horrible.  They promise a pay system based on how much work you produce, but it always averaged out to $8 or $9 an hour. Favoritism by management determines if you make more. Management does not care about how they treat their employees. Unless you cannot find any other employment & desparately need a job,  I would not recommend working here."
bad,temporary position but the employers lacked  tack. typical day at work. i am not a data entry specialist. coworkers friends for life
bad,"It has been a rocky and rough time with the company, but it's only going downhill and it's not a pleasant place to work.  I have been there so long because I love my work family, many of us have been together for more than 5 years, but the good ones are all dwindling down and there's not many benefits."
bad,"Assist customers with insurance polices. Taking payments, prescription refill and fill. It was very hard not having supervisor support when needed or when customer had an issue only a supervisor was allowed to handle. It would take an extremely long time for a supervisor to be available."
bad,"The organization is tricky. It is hard to move up unless you take a position without a pay increase. The information learned can be used at another company. I suggest you learn what you can and do a good job. There may be a pay increase, or you can use the skills somewhere else. Some say the pay is not good, but that depends on the client. Many coworker have purchase homes, put children through college, and even got out of debit."
bad,"Upper Management lost our contract. 300 jobs impacted. We were the best center the client had. Even THEIR OWN at THEIR OWN SITE couldn't beat our CSAT numbers. Just goes to show no matter how great you are, lay offs happen."
bad,Not a healthy place to work to keep your sanity.  Very unprofessional management not trained to be management material.  Unwilling to listen to their employees for how to improve.
bad,No comment as I was not employed by the business for a long enough period of time to offer an opinion. The team I worked with was great with a willingness to achieve the goals the business required.
bad,"This specific center was dedicated to Sprint customer care.  It gave me a look into how Sprint was like which is why I will never have Sprint service and tell everyone I know not to get Sprint service.  Everyone was paid more for selling stuff then giving a good customer service experience.  We were required to try to sell stuff on every call, no matter what reason the customer called in. "
bad,"Most time is spent on the phone assisting customers with their issues."
bad,"Awesome place to work to gain experience in the field, thoroughly lacks opportunities for advancement and support necessary to be successful beyond bare minimal requirements."
bad,This is my first call center job and I already know that it is not in order. Training is done backwards and taught by people who don't know how to do their own jobs. Everyone wants to be a leader/manager but no one knows what is going on half the time including the managers. The only upside is the group I went through training with and even then they sometimes listen to others more than what we were taught. It is pretty much a place where no one knows what is going on but everyone likes to be in your face about what you are doing.
bad,"Working at home was the only benefit of this position.  I keyed medical claims for out of state health insurance.  We had in office training for two weeks and then transitioned to work from home.  Direct supervisor was hard to get a hold of for questions.  I couldn't reach her by telephone or email.  Supervisor consistently replied to my questions hours after I had completed the claim.  I thought I was a fast typist to get a decent wage, but I rarely went above minimum wage."
bad,"I WAS DESPERATE !!!. But even then  I thought that I would be given a FAIR chance to preform. You are temp for 90 days,, NOT. at the end of 60 days the HARRASSMENT starts. "" if your not at 20 applications now, why do you think you will be at that number  in 90 days?"" A  lack of applications, system shut downs, applications ""stacking""  by more experienced workers, and making sure that your work is 100% accurate.  All of this and the constant interruptions being call  to ""quick"" meetings where your told your not meeting your quota for the day,,,daaaa!   STOP WITH THE MEETINGS!!!!  ON my last day I was on point 20 apps and short six days from 90.... but let go anyway.  "
bad,Trabajábamos muchas horas sin contrato y cobrabámos muy poco.
bad,"Not the ideal place to work if you require structure and balance. Xerox does not provide either. I did learn a lot about over the phone customer service, but not without sacrificing my time. Over time is a joke, and you will constantly be questioning your pay stubs, and legalities of the position. Training was the best part of this job."
bad,"Xerox in bolingbrook has no hiring standards,employees are allowed to break policies depending on who their supervisor is and there is favoritism in promotions"
bad,"During the time that I worked for Xerox (formerly ACS), I learned many skills that I use on a daily basis, including: "
bad,as pessoas só são realmente valorizadas e promovidas se puxao o saco da liderança
bad,"Blue Cross Blue Shield outsourced their claims dept to be processed by Xerox , been doing the same job 14 yrs"
bad,"Bedbugs! I just quit this job after 4 months because they were infested with bed bugs. All of the managers are trying to be hush hush about it. But absolutely not okay, they didnt try to do anything about it. Most of the managers are nice so thats a plus. But i had no life, i worked from 7 am to 7pm, they have monthly mandatory overtime, which is difficult for people who have kids in daycare, plus sometimes they have mandatory overtime for the entire month. On top of that they do mandatory shift change, also challenging for parents with kids in daycare. They just dont care about us or our lives outside of work. They dont try to work with you. Also if you are on a call and you need supervisors approval for something, or a question,or escalation, you will likely stand there with your hand in the air for 20 mins with a crabby impatient customer on the phone waiting for someone to come help. Just not worth it."
bad,"If you are into a constant changing environement with lots of stress, then this is the place for you.  I work in the call center in Houston, Tx and inconsistencies are the norm here."
bad,"A lot of work for little money.  Training is non-exitstant, you pretty much have to teach yourself.  It's not bad once you get used to things. I've heard from others who have been here for years, there are no raises and it could be because the perk is that you work from home."
bad,"I feel that this review will not reflect Xerox as a whole but is targeted at WDS in Poole. The working environment is poor with very little assistance from supervisors and management. The staff turnover is ridiculously high as basically all staff are dissatisfied with the role. Management will also sack staff with only 24 hours notice for the most minor of offences only to take on new staff which will later be dismissed. There is basically no possibility to advance within the company. Staff are given advanced roles (at the same pay rate) only to be stripped of the role a month or so down the line due to ""changes in the contract"". Constant threats of job loss with a 24 hour notice period. Morale in the office is usually low. Call times are very targeted so at times you feel very much like you are not providing customer service and simply trying to get the customer off the phone as soon as possible - Not the way I want to work. Not the sort of workplace I wanted to stay in. I felt the need to resign."
bad,"I got to work in many large Banking and Law Firms, also The Guggenheim Museum.  I would work on the latest color and mono chrome copiers, I always liked hi-tech equipment and poses an affinity for them.  Coming to Xerox I didn't need any training because I was doing the same task as I was at Dillon Read, if anything, less, more specialized,- only maintaining machines vs maintaining and operating.  What I didn't like about Xerox is that they would loose many contracts and as I was only outsourced service would end up at some other site.  I would always give it my best efforts but Xerox had many competitors who would offer much lower pricing for the outsourced services provided."
bad,"This is a good company for starter experience, but not for career advancement. There is no organization in management and there are no true opportunites. You are not fairly compensated for your experience and work effort."
bad,"It was chaos. The supervisors were no were to be seen most of the time, and the Operation Managers were just as bad. Nobody in management wanted to do their job."
bad,"I worked for xerox through a staffing company. I was hired to process healthcare applications. I was taking inbound calls too. Like call center environment. What I enjoyed about the job was processing the cases and Working with my coworkers. What disliked about this company was the inconsistent of the work flow. First you pull your task and process many cases as you can. The mgt complains about they need quantity then they flip flop and insist on just quality. So your stressed out worrying about processing fast cases and sending out bad quality work. Then there are weekly QA's too many bad ones your walked out the door."
bad,I worked there for 6 months then I got laid off and they did not care. They did not help me find another job because they really don't care about you..
bad,"out dated technology, understaffed, overworked & underpaid, a lot of empty promises for advancement."
bad,What I love about my job is the people that I work with. I also love what I do but that is where the positives end.  Xerox took over Suntrust at this particular location and it has been a disaster ever since. There is no room for advancement and you are treated like you are inept and incapable of doing your job.  I have been the top performer in the department I work and when it came time to give me a raise I was told I hadn't been on the job long enough.  I think it is despicable that companies like Xerox can get away with paying people scraps.  80 percent of my co workers cannot even make ends meet which means they more than qualify for some form of government assistance.
bad,"Highly regimented working environment. Department Heads are largely Japanese. "
bad,they don't care about their employees. to them you are just a number and can be replaced. They are slow when it comes to getting things done.
bad,"This is overall a horrible place to work. The management is unprofessional, the staff is promoted on biased means. Skills that are used daily are not acknowledged but people with no commitment to the job or the customers."
bad,I found this job to be very boring and unrewarding.  I took this position because I hadn't been in the workforce for a couple years and this was a way to rebuild my confidence.  My day basically consisted of taking customer service calls for Sprint one after another after another.  There were no windows in the giant room we were in and they fit as many people in there as possible.
bad,"Starting for the company, they advertise that you make up to $13 an hour when you actually start at $10. Then, they advertise unlimited overtime but then when you are a good agent but your stats are just below par in some areas but excellent in other they revoke you from working overtime which is only way to get a decent check,"
bad,"I would take back to back calls while other employees milked their time off the phones.  The management rarely enforced rules about this as they spent much of their time focused on the talk about their personal lives while they had some work program on their computer screen so it would look like they were doing actual work related activity.  The training for the job was unfocused and there was a lot of jargon used that was unfamiliar to trainees.  During training we took too many breaks and were released from class early every day."
bad,I hated working here!!! The Apple side wasn't the issue it was the Xerox side of things. No one knew what was going on and the management was biased. The story changed on a minute to minute basis and not well thought out. The attendance point system was a joke. Over all the job was easy but the people were difficult.
bad,"Xerox pro's - continual change"
bad,The typical day at work was going in and seeing if you would wind up with no job at the end of the day because either your boss didn't like you or something that was not done correctly without letting a representative know what needed to be corrected to fix the issues and give them a second chance. The job was practically you had co-workers to help you because there was no supervisors around when you needed one to be there to assist you. All the supervisors were buddy buddy which when one would go on break then all the supervisors disappeared. I have not learned much while working there except to expect the rules and regulations to change without being told about anything of what is going on. There was nothing enjoyable about the job except helping the customers when they called in about their Verizon bills.
bad,"I worked as a Sr. Financial Analyst in the IT Outsourcing division of Xerox that was formerly ACS. My understanding is that division has since been sold to Atos. Many of the higher level managers were not pleasant to work with and were frequently making decisions that impacted the lowest level employees with little regard. Increasing profits was always a higher priority than treating employees well. "
bad,"If you work for Xerox, you have no personal life. You are on call 24 hours a day and you also work long hours in the office. A typical day for me is from 9am- 8 or 9pm."
bad,"Work days were to long and I had no backup, so I couldn't take time off."
bad,The co workers at Xerox and Managers are very judgemental. Discrimination is a problem at Xerox. An employee should never be judged or discriminized by anyone at a job. Someone really needs to do something about this . I was being judged by co workers and staff because of my past that my kids father posted about me on facebook about . I'm a changed person . My past doesn't dictate who i am now or my work abilities .
bad,Tasked with a multitude of projects to manage daily. Management only interested when there ware issues. The company enforced furloughs yearly without pay. The company laid off most experienced resources and decided to go with offshore resources. I did enjoy working with my co-workers.
bad,There are no items that I would like to share now or ever in my future.
bad,"It was a decent place to work the pay was too low the the amount of responsibility. No room for advancement and the management was poor, they pay just enough so you don't quit good as a stepping stone not a carrier. "
bad,"did lost of data entry, reporting, sit for hours, management was unapproachable, did not communicate vital information, some co workers had attitudes never new when and what to say to them. the hardest part of the job was dealing with management team. most enjoyable having a good working relationship with the buiness"
bad,"Great products, great brand, sick company culture and practices"
bad,"The management there was absolutely horrible. For example, when you needed assistance with a phone call you were dealing with, the manager wouldn't get up and come assist you. So that of course made call time bad, then you could get into trouble for because your call time was too high."
bad,"Wrote proposals for clients on a daily basis."
bad,"Mondays and Tuesday, are where are  plan out most of the week and forecasted events that the team deliverables tien into and brief them about priorities and the methods by which the targets could be achieved. "
bad,"I have learned quite a bit a Xerox.  I have learned that there is plenty to gain from every type of job.  There is constant change at Xerox which makes it difficult to assimilate into the culture. Many of the individuals are driven solely on pay.  I do not see many new hires that stay for more than 2 years.  I enjoyed interacting with customers at all levels, including C-level individuals.  I had great coworkers that would help navigate the complex internal system of Xerox.  Xerox did consistently make it difficult for the sales individuals to submit orders, get paid, or get issues resolved for customers.  The management was clearly disconnected with what was really going on."
bad,Customer Call Center but wages are paid on production level. No calls no pay
bad,"Loved working with Xerox, Had great hopes as various opportunities presented itself every day with new and different departments to work with. Different locations and positions available."
bad,Great group of people to work with; the team make the work environment pleasant.
bad,"This position got very boring very quickly, employees were dinged for so many things during reviews with team leads and supervisors. Quality Assurance reviews were performed by another person who broke down all points associated with your score, but overall, the company didn't give employees the impression that they cared about the people who worked for them. "
bad,There is no management presence at Xerox and it lacks departmental cohesiveness which causes many set backs for quality. The coworkers and the supervisors were always pleasant but morale was low for all employees of all levels. The pay is decent but not worth the terrible schedule and negative environment.
bad,"Xerox does NOTHING to keep its employees because it gets paid by the government for hiring employees and to do so, it fires them left and right.  You have to earn 88% on customer satisfaction surveys to stay employed. You will be told you only have to reach 88% once every 3 months to stay employed, but then they will turn around and give you 2 weeks notice followed by another 2 weeks and so forth.  "
bad,"Work was not hard if you are familiar with computers and cell phones.   Management is quality oriented, but they do not correct errors in quality surveys, even with a voice recording that is all positive, if a 0 was entered instead of a 10, you would be scored a 0.  Hardest part was demanding customers wanting free stuff, ie free time on phones for no reason. "
bad,"I love taking calls, it was fun, easy and steady paychecks. But my supervisor made me hate my job. She rarely helped, anytime I asked a question she always got mad and send me to help desk, then helpdesk would get mad because I was asking them. So I decided to start looking for a new job that fit me. I felt way to overqualified for the job."
bad,"Upon getting hired at Xerox, I was trained to work under the Verizon BGCO Fulfillment project. My third day out of training, where we had direct Verizon trainers from Salt Lake City come train us for a couple days and a month of ""You don't need this info since you won't be on the phones, the whole Fulfillment Team, including supervisors, were called in to a meeting to let us know our jobs no longer existed and we had an hour to forward all work to direct Verizon since Fulfillment is no longer supported by vendor. Not only that, but I would not be doing BGCO anymore either. Complete department change. New training. Apparently Verizon yanked some contracts with Xerox and we had ONE HOUR NOTICE. Completely unprofessional and unorganized. I still work there, but am actively looking for a new job. On the bright side, they offer unlimited overtime and the people that I work with are fantastic! I love my supervisors and the people I work with, and I loved the job I did for a whopping three days."
bad,"If you don't have call center experience and would like to get some, come to Xerox. "
bad,"A typical day at work is basically just at your computer taking phone calls, usually back to back since the que can get pretty high. There are two 10 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch in which the lunch you do not get paid for. I obviously learned everything within Verizon Wireless prepaid services since that is the project that I was on. The management is not up to par unless you get a decent supervisor, most of the management just sits around and tries to stay within site goals for themselves and doesn't necessarily help you out if need be and if you have to miss a day for personal reasons or being sick even with a doctors note, forget it, you will be written up, and after getting 2 points (in which you can receive two points if one of those days happens to be on a weekend) you will be written up on a final and next time your late, over on a break, anything at all in which you are not working when you're supposed to be even in case of an emergency, you will be terminated. The turn over rate at Xerox is completely ridiculous, mainly because supervisors will terminate if they just plainly do not like you. I personally have been working there for 5 months, training the pay is 9.50, and once in production you make 10.00 an hour, but I never got my actual pay. I've been bringing it up to the OM, supervisors, and nothing has changed. I need this pay for living expenses and that is one of the main reasons I'm looking for a different place to work as well. The co-workers are all really nice and I get along with them well, they don't like working there either but we kind of deal"
bad,"Mandatory overtime.  Overtime is good, mandatory not so much.  You don't get any benefits until 90 days on the job, including holiday pay.  The customers can hurt your pay when they don't get what they want and it generally doesn't matter if you did the job right.  The support system is inadequate and impacts your performance, which can hurt stats and also pay if it results in a negative survey.  Every place I've worked had an extension for help, but here you raise your hand and hope someone sees it."
bad,"Xerox is a very stressful place to work. Once in a while, management will show their appreciation for all of your hard work but not as often as they should."
bad,A typical day at work was watching movies at our desk. The hardest part was dealing with a few unprofessional and irate callers. The most enjoyable part of the job would be participating in weekly raffles within the call center for a chance to go home early on Fridays. (An early out). Without pay of course.
bad,"Smart people, but some key members of management are not very respectful to employees which is fairly demoralizing."
bad,I like what I do at my job. Just dont like everything that comes with it including the pay
bad,Xerox isn't a bad place to work...if you don't mind the fact that at any moment for no good reason the company will decide to offshore your job.
bad,Assisted pharmacists with info to get their clients a paid claimfor their prescriptions.
bad,"Days are long and uneventful, the workflow is random and call transit even more.  "
bad,"A typicalday at Xerox was fun and friendly and very productive. I workedin cutomer Service where we handled a high volume of calls wih a ""first call resolution"" type approach."
bad,"Typical day at work, I would be there 15 mins early, would have to wait on a seat and pc, then when I could not login by 3:30, I would have to make up time, that was beyond my control, because of their bad scheduling.  I have learned to calm customers down, when they were irate and needing assistance. The Mgmt was very unorganized.  Then supervisors I had were somewhat organized; but with some of the upper mgmt, if you weren't in their click you were not going to get to change schedules, get particular days off, etc.. My coworkers were great.  The hardest part of the job is when one person tells you to do something one way, then another would tell you something different; Not able to actually take notes on the things that have changed, you would actually try to read training info in btw calls and because of the way the calls were coming in you really never could get time to understand the changes  Also, never knowing what you were going to be paid from one payday to another.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist a client and, by the end of the call, have them in a more positive outlook about the particular agency worked for."
bad,"many different shifts, some nice people to work with, no chance of raises or advancement, super low hourly pay, half hour lunches, micro managed , stupid spiffs where you can win a bag of chips, crowded breakroom, a lot of weird people work here."
bad,"Here is the problem:"
bad,The job was just unorganized.... It made the job a uncomfortable place to work in.
bad,Execs constantly telling us how great company is doing but no pay raises or benefit increases ever handed out.
bad,"Xerox Commercial Solutions/ACS is a unprofessional place for work environment. The job is under new managent, which is not to fimilar with whats best to do for company. Managment chooses favorites with Supervisors and with representives. This job has a high turn over rate. If not preforming supervisor can fire you so it wont mess up sups bonuses. The base pay is $9.50 with the eligiblity to make up to $14.25. Which metrics change every month sometimes weekly which makes it difficult to have a steady pay check knowing what  your pay will be. This job is open on all holidays and will be required to work if your working schedule falls on holidays. Their are alot of extra activties that are being place within building and outside building that can get you either arrested or fired. Most enjoyable part of the job is taking a hour lunch. Because trrust me you will look forward to that hour off te clock."
bad,"I worked for xerox for over 2 years. I was top of my training class and offered a supervisor role after only 6 months on the floor. I declined the offer provided the door be open later so I would be able to finish perfecting my original role first. In late summer of 2011 they changed the pay system so that if you fail a customer survey your pay per minute while your on a call is decreased for every survey you fail, bottoming out at minimum wage. Average labor market research shows that the average wage for a customer service representative is over $17 an hour. So, to put this straight, the $13.50 an hour they advertise as a top tier is only if the calls are back to back busy and your handle time is crazy low and you have no bad surveys for the last month(or about 1000 calls***). most people at this job end up making minimum wage, working mandatory overtime(about 5 or more hours a week), and eventually get fired for anything they can stick you with to replace you with another fresh, naive face to grind into the floor until completely spent. I quite because of a forced department change that resulted in a further decrease in pay while harassing me about overtime to the point of giving me a panic attack. and I'm deal with peoples issues all day, and they gave me a panic attack. not worth it folks.  "
bad,"This company pays on an ABC pay rate. Meaning you make minimum wage with a potential to earn more. If you actually care about your cusotmers and want to help them, then you end up sacrificing your pay. They make it difficult for people with disabilities to get accomodation."
bad,"I worked in this place from 2010 till 2012 in the beginning was fine but after time everything change in bad, they not appreciate your time and effort to do your job because you start to work but you don't know a what time you going home, they have a inappropriate method to pay your money that If you do mistake they take money from your check. Is horrible, many people start to work and after they see how they really works they left. No a good place to work for real."
bad,Co-workers and lack of management skills made work days very hard.
bad,"You start on the phones the minute you walk in and your on the phone the entire day other then break times, we went through supervisors like crazy new ones every month or so, and the people you are working with depended on where you sat that day. Some people where great some people just did not care. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers you could not please not matter what you did. The most enjoyable part of the day was when you made a customer happy and pleased with services."
bad,"The compensation for Xerox was a perfect fit, but the job itself was fairly terrible. The customer survey system was what based how you kept your job, and even if you did exactly what the customer asked they could still fail your survey, and you can potentially lose your job because somebody felt like being rude that day. The management always goes against one another and against a lot of the training practices while your on the floor, and they cut corners and try to sabotage other teams so that their numbers are better than everyone else's (and that's straight out of a supervisor's mouth, those aren't MY words). All and all it was just terrible to work there and I never looked forward to going back in. This was the worst job I have ever had."
bad,Go in to work to help customers that call for their prescriptions. A typical day at work is working hard to make sure you have helped the customers to your best abilities.
bad,High Volume Calls For a Call Center
bad,"I was just starting my 4th week of OJT. Training was the process for handling guests who were calling in to book travel, changes to their exsisting reservations,questions concerning their Elevate accounts, problem solving. I really enjoyed most of the classmates who I went through the training with."
bad,"After training, (which was the worst training I have ever received) co-workers informed my team members and I our pay rate was $3.00 less per hour than what our Supervisor and Recruiter stated during the hiring process. Of course, we asked our Supervisor and she ignored the issue and told us not to worry about our pay because it would be a distraction. Our Supervisor would not answer questions about anything. If we asked more than once or emailed her more than once, she would speak to us in a horrible, disrespectful manner. She was very unwilling to give our team any type of assistance. Senior Staff stick together and will lie if necessary to make the situation hard for you if you keep asking about pay or anything else which may make the Supervisor unhappy. Our client was located in California which made their lunch at 3:00 - 4:00 pm our time. Our Supervisor would send everyone to lunch but could not figure out why calls were in queue. She would keep hitting IM for the one person answering calls (which was hard enough) to get you to cut a call short which is impossible when you have just started speaking to someone and figuring out the issue. This is the worst job I have ever had. We were treated as if we were lowly Call Center Staff. Senior Staff would never take suggestions even though we were on the front lines. I feel Xerox is taking advantage of the poor economy. Xerox is like a Predator taking advantage of the unemployed. They feel they can treat you awful because you need a job so bad. The one part of the job I did enjoy was solving our client's issues. Our client's staff"
bad,Working Customer Service for Xerox is a joke. Getting a day off is like pulling teeth. The attendance policy goes by points and no matter why you need a day off you get pointed. You would probably have to provide a corpse if you needed time off to grieve the death of a loved one. The only thing that really saved me is the fact that I had an excellent supervisor. I could not come into work one day due to being very ill. My supervisor waived the attendance point and I made up the time on my days off. My manager wasn't exactly the kind of person that takes the human aspect of the employee into account. I went over my 20 minutes of allotted break time by one minute and he threatened to take away my holiday pay. Again my supervisor stepped in and made sure that I got my holiday pay. He would not let me work 10 hours on New Year's Day for nothing. My supervisor was even going to take the whole team to Olive Garden because we did so well. I would never expect an employer to take everyone to a restaurant but its those kind of gestures that made me want to stay there.
bad,Xerox is a great place to get professional sales training. The key to be sucessful within Xerox is to develop an internal network (management) to protect your job and give you the accounts that can help you to be sucessful.
bad,"I love the job it self. I like taking calls and helping customers. The company is a joke. I do not know a single person who likes their job. We used to get paid per call and could make some really good money. Now it is $9 an hour with potential to make more depending on stats. But they make the goal so far out of reach to make sure they don't give you a chance to get more than 9. They are constantly changing the pay scale and taking sale offers away so that we have to work 3 times as hard to get a decent sales bonus. Oh...and if you have to call out, not only do you not get paid for that day but they also take money away from you for having high absenteeism. I hate this place and am trying to find another place. And my supervisor acts like I don't exist and I bothersom if I need help. They make you work mandatory 6th day and if you can't work it you get in trouble."
bad,"The TPL Recovery Dept is run by a bunch of immature women who never outgrew their high school mentality, who choose to act as hall monitors and bullies instead of team leads, and who, if they decide they don't like you, will just make your life miserable in the office until you finally get fed up enough to leave. The turnover rate is horrible and they have no concern regarding employee retention. While the job itself is challenging and never boring, management makes it impossible to enjoy being their."
bad,"inbound calls from sprint customers, trained for six weeks, and pay was reasonable"
bad,"Its an ok company, stocks are low... Many of the employees are always unhappy. The management is unorganized and the company is not doing well as a whole. I don't recommend this company to work for."
bad,Constantly busy environment with demanding customers. My manager does not treat all employees equal. The hardest part of the job is the physical labor which includes lifting many boxes of paper and print jobs on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I actually get to work on the paper work and billing.
bad,"Many XEROX branches that came from the former ACS (prior to its acquisition) are paid by production (they call it ABC)! The company does not give raises if you are paid by that method and feel that if you want to earn more, you should figure out how to produce more work - even if you are working at your maximum capacity. They feel that giving a winter party with really cheap door prizes for a few and a summer festivity is enough to show they care! No one, other than management, gets bonuses - oops, I forgot that they come around with a cart with HIGH CARB HIGH CALORIE snacks once a week. The office opens at 7:30 and the doors are locked until that EXACT time so if you start at 7:30, you have absolutely no time to setup your work station and organize that days production, get a cup of coffee or check your email. However, if you start a later shift, you can come if at 7:30 and have all the time you need to get ready for the day. They will not make any exceptions for the earlier start time by even 5 to 10 minutes. I made a few friends and will cherish them and really learned quite a bit about the subject that my division was contracted for. I plan on using that information to further my career."
bad,"You might consider Xerox if you're fresh out of college to use as a stepping stone, but that would be about it. After spending 18 months putting bandaids on ancient infrastructure in the Cigna Division Mailroom and finally helping to get some new equipment setup I was told ""thanks for your time, but you don't work here anymore"" citing that there was a lack of work. Then I find in my subsequent job search that 3 days before they fired me, they posted a job for a .net developer for the same location that I'm fully qualified for having 14+ years of Microsoft/.Net development experience."
bad,"Xerox used to be a really great place to work. The stated goal was to treat your employees like you wanted your best customers to be treated. Employees could expect to be treated with respect, be well compensated, and be given opportunities to improve their skills. A hard working, skilled employee never had to worry about job security."
bad,This job is only for people who dont have any kids they are not willing to work with you and r always changing thibgs around
bad,"Good experience of current corporate culture, facing every day challenges and realizing that it is not healthy environment for growing individual in general."
bad,The overall issue with xerox is their inability to recognize or manage change. Once the decline of the paper document started they placed all their efforts toward processes and not technology. Lost many good people during years propping up services. No product to sell anymore
bad,"This was a decent reliable job, but there was no room for advancement. They also change your shift on a monthly basis so it is hard to keep a set schedule."
bad,"Management is all promoted from within, but only by those who are favored. Negative environment overall. Those who are willing to suck up and lose all outside interests are promoted quickly beyond qualifications."
bad,"You are on the phones all day, which is fine, but the supervisors and their team assistants are super messy. Anything you tell your supervisor in confidence (Like why you missed work or you had/have a medical condition) will get spread around."
bad,"This job was easy but it was like being in high school, Miro manage was horrible and it was the worst experience and 1st I've ever had and everything was all a lie when it came to hourly pay and incentives etc, But I hear its a better work environment since the name has changed to Conduent. But call enter will always be call center vibe. Don't make any friends and stay to self."
bad,They laid a lot of good people off. Re-structure of the Company. I don't have too much to say about the company after they took control. Everything was being downsized.
bad,This job supported me through college. I was able to make enough money to not owe anything. I enjoyed working with the people that worked there. I did not like the way they managed the branch I worked.
bad,Xerox was a wonderful place to work in the 80s and 90s.  Since then there have been nothing but cutbacks and poorly thought out management changes. Everything about the company has gone down hill since 2008.  The final blow was a drastic cutback on severance packages!
bad,"call center customer service is a hard and trying job "
bad,"as a customer service agent, we were told to be at our seats at all times, unless it was our paid break time. Asked to use the restroom during our break times. Two 15 min break every 2 hours, with 1 unpaid 30min lunch in the middle of your day. Stressful work environment, phones would ring nonstop and management would task us with more and more with no compensation benefits."
bad,"Work here was stressful. You were timed. 90 seconds between calls and they pushed you to keep an average of 15-minute calls, even if helping customers took longer than that. "
bad,"Xerox was by far one they worse places I had ever worked for, this place had no management skills that stood behind there employees. They treated their employees like prisoners and acted like they was children. Regardless if this was professional place of business or not, I currently work for the Federal government and have a clearance and I have more freedom than I did at this place. It is sad that one employer is aloud to do so much negative stuff to there employees."
bad,"Here it is a systematic work, nothing much to improve our skills. but the good part is no one will interfere in our work. also having good ambience to work."
bad,Training could have more info and be longer than what's given. Higher up management don't do their job so the inbound call takers are being chewd out by customers for lack of responsibilities from management.
bad,"I have not worked at Xerox in 18 years so I cannot offer an honest opinion of the company at this time.  Xerox training, when I went through it, was very good and help prepare me for the next steps in my career."
bad,"It was a tremendously stressful environment, employee wages fluctuated greatly depending on customer satisfaction. employees are encouraged to be untruthful to customer to elicit positive reviews. and advancement is almost none existent due to large amount of employee, thus resulting in a large turn over rate."
bad,"Xerox was an ok place to start roots if your fresh out of high school, or college. The pay was low, the culture was not something you want after 30 and there was no room for advancement."
bad,Xerox did not have formal training for most job roles. They failed to meet their commitment with regards to salary reviews. They decreased our salary as part of a exciting new incentive program then made incentives unattainable. I would not work at Xerox again.
bad,"If you work Second Shift, you need to check a box or you will not get paid the extra rate even though you entered your hours correctly. If you complain, or suggest they fix this, you will not last long."
bad,Lots of changes in the works . . . . . leading to fast paced demanding work environment.  Lots of opportunity to learn and grow for those willing to sacrifice greatly with limited advancement opportunities.
bad,The company did not concern itself with the well being of its employees. What was needed was an focus on employee development and education so that there could me a mutual sense of loyalty.
bad,i work there and i worked long hours and over looked they always had a budget problem i was always made out to be the fall guy when things didnt get done right
bad,"Overall, Xerox is a good company however i feel employee's should get more pay and better treatment when it comes to bathroom breaks  and lunch breaks no one enjoys working in discomfort."
bad,The experience here wasn't that different from any call canter environment. The managers were oaky with conveying information. The only Issue I have had was how the site closing was handled. Information was not filtered through
bad,"Very high turnover of employees, job was affecting the health of many of my co-workers who would be rushed to the hospital right from the job.  I don't recommend it"
bad,Pay is on a point scale that is impossible to manage.  Managers constantly disregard employees need for assistance.  The work environment was hostile.
bad,"I do not think I liked the way the training is done. They are way behind in their teaching skills and formats they use for newly hired staff. "
bad,"Nothing positive to say, environment was not good at all. Management was all over the place and they are very reactive vs. proactive and really want profit over employees well being."
bad,Really great teams and individuals. The products are great the execution is often weak. Over promise and under deliver.   Spend more time making bandaids then fixing processes.
bad,Xerox is undergoing severe change and it is not clear if it is to the benefit of the company or the brand.   It is not an environment where employees can thrive and learn.
bad,"Their is no room for group,the pay was not enough and the manager where not understanding and friendly.the time frame for lunch is too short and working environment was not healthy"
bad,Overall this company was inconsistent of what they wanted to do one thing after another.  There was no recognition for their employees the management team was pour.  If you didn’t do overtime then they would right you up.
bad,The company is going thru a ton of internal and external changes....major layoffs....was able to dodge the layoffs for over 20 years. I would not recommend working there at the present time.
bad,"One of the worst jobs I ever had. Management micro managed, they were horrible at their jobs. Had a death in the immediate family and they had the audacity to make me feel bad about calling out"
bad,This company has always had a large amount of turn over due to their strict rules.  It is a very fast paced and competitive working environment.  There is little to no down time so you really appreciate your breaks.  Training when you first start is good however if you have trouble later the management was not very helpful or flexible in assisting staff to overcome issues.  Many folks quit due to the high amount of stress and lack of assistance and support when needed by upper management.
bad,"If you like sitting behind a cube while on a phone for hours, this is the job for you. There are teams and some incentives but a lot of unjust favoritism and a false sense of collaboration, which can be seen in the amount of turnover."
bad,Pay wasn't good with Xerox but did improve when Conduent took over.  Benefits have pretty good minus the health care deductible.  Earning PTO is easy and as long as time is available you can have the day off.
bad,Not sure where this division is going Glad I am gone Do not go to work here they have no idea how long they will be in business. No sales or forcasted sales
bad,Toxic work environment with little to no strategy.  Typical work day starts at 6:45 and ends around 5 PM.  Little management support.  Constant turnover.  Inability to fire poor performers and problem employees.
bad,"Xerox has become a cliquish Company where managers bring in their friends and favorites and fire or ship out employees that were there before the manager gained the position. Mangers often have no managerial education or training , most managers are engineers elevated to a manager's role."
bad,"the current environment is extremely challenging, stressful, chaotic, and not enjoyable.  The take over by the new CEO has created an environment of instability and there is not sense of security."
bad,I had only been with the company for ten years so I was considered to be candidate for the IRIF. I was promoted to RSS because of skills in the field. My job was to help people repair their machines or network them to scan and print over the phone. I had them do their own work so Xerox didn't have to send out a tech.
bad,"Xerox was a good company to work for but the chance of advancing was limited to who you know not what you know.  The teams worked long hours and management did not any and idea in which direction they wanted to go.  They took over another company which had no processes in place, did things on the fly and once they had established processes in place still did not follow them."
bad,It's a great starting place for the young people that's just starting out in the work force to n. They do provide you with extensive training. It a great starting point
bad,I have gained enough experience to be an asset to a company that will encourage leadership. Am typical day at work is helping client employees to enroll in their health benefits and educate them.
bad,Xerox will just be a platform to get you to where you are trying to go. Turnover rate is too high to become a career advancement. Be careful of working too many hours.
bad,Xerox/Conduent Hires the lowest management possible.  The staff do nothing to support or lead by example to other employees.  They have favourites and if your not one of them you are treated like dirt.
bad,"I worked for Xerox in a call center for 4 years. I never got a raise, and they kept piling more and more work on me without offering me any more compensation."
bad,"Management didn't seem to want to there"
bad,numerous processing and not collaborative teams which only add customer service delays and no value add. There is no communication within high level management structures and low structure.
bad,This job was suppose to be a temp to hire position.  Being employed with the for almost 18 month.  Only to be told four weeks before you are suppose to be hire as a Xerox employee you will not be getting hired.
bad,Like returning to high school and finding out all of the nerds want to try their hand at being jocks this time. What work will be like will depend on your project and who is working in your project.
bad,Xerox is no longer part of the card services division. While we were still part of Xerox the company was fun and the environment was much more laid back.
bad,They said they were cutting back some of us eventhough i haded been there but 4-5 mths an then the day after the mouse jump on me they called my in the office and fired me.
bad,"Sitting in your team cubicle for 8 hours a day. Its nice if you end up only seeing your boss half the week. I guess the company culture is nice, especially if you are a smoker. Seems like that was the happiest time for employees."
bad,"Xerox use to be a great place to work.  Unfortunately, upper management ran it into the ground.  Outsourced a lot of IT offshore which made it extremely difficult to get things done.  Employees were put under highly stressful situations to get the system projects done.  Had to work extremely hard without any recognition or even a thank you from upper management.  Management then went and outsourced a major complex project to E&Y IT because they thought they could get it done quicker and cheaper.  It failed miserably and nothing was delivered! As a result of this outsourcing, several people were layed off and Xerox lost a wealth of knowledge and skills.  Xerox no longer values their employees which is very disheartening."
bad,Xerox is a very good company to work for.  I enjoy working with management and feel that they are very appreciative of the work you do each day.  I loved working with the people that I do on a daily basis.
bad,I worked for xerox through the xbox project that Microsoft eventually pulled from that cooperation. Ran very unorganized. Trainer quit in the middle of our training. Did not recycle our class through. Had many different teachers never trained properly and then thrown out on the floor. Ran VERY POORLY at the time 4 years ago.
bad,This job was not for me.There was no base salary no benefits.I had a terrible territory.There was NO possibility for me to succeed in this position based on the area I had to launch new sales.I did not like my mgr. she was harsh to me and negative towards me from the very beginning of my employment.
bad,"I worked there for more than 6 years. Now its a company called Conduent and it has gone downhill. They put incompetent people in management. They took away alot of benefits like 401K match, tuition assistance, and stock shares.  There is no incentive for growth. There are no salary increases at all. There are employees working there for more than 15 years and they have not had any pay increases and are making less then new hires."
bad,"If you like to work hard for really nothing, this is the job for you. The hardest part of the job was being trained in so many areas, but not compensated enough."
bad,Esta empresa estaba muy bien pero el mal manejo de los supervisores se vino abajo
bad,"fast paste job with an opportunity to lean customer skills."
bad,"the way the work ethics there was when i worked there was horrible, supervisor was very disrespectful with other under he's team. would not recommend this place to anyone."
bad,"its just a ""job"" not to much of a career not the highest paying it the industry but it over all ok if u need a place of temp employment and expierience"
bad,Its not my cup of tea .. It was laid back but management was not goid and the pay rate was low nit wirth what you work for.. Its quick and easy to get in the job
bad,"The company was very political, the right thing to do was to 'look good' never the right thing for the project.  Very cut throat, people feel concerned about their jobs, will do anything to stay in favor."
bad,"With my experience being a sales representative and customer service in the company, we are promise that we will receive incentives since we also handle sales however by the end of the month, you'll be advice that you are no longer qualified."
bad,Xerox is a company that just doesn't seem to want to move on with technology.  I never felt a part of this company and never felt like I had any value to add.
bad,I like to feel stable where I work and don't like a lot of change. If you are not extremely outgoing or if you don't like new places Xerox is not for you. I loved the training and it was great while I looked for another job. After training you are thrown to the wolves dealing with angry customers and waiting for help for extended amounts of time when you are unsure of a resolution. Its a different desk everyday and if you dont have the same schedule as your supervisor good luck getting help from a different one.
bad,"i hated the job, you where under appreciated but its a good way to make good money i would probably go back if i was in a bind. its easy work and its a easy 4 month training course"
bad,"Job was easy, employees were helpful and nice. Management was not helpful yelled at you if you needed help. Asked to borrow money from you for their lunch or breaks. Very unprofessional."
bad,"the job it self is not hard, however i think more training should be implemented and we are not compensated for the work we are required to do, we are required to work on holidays which should not be since there the main offices are closed"
bad,No comment.  Very stressful.  Too much information to learn in such a short period of time.  Some people were helpful and some did not care.  It was not a conducive environment for me.
bad,"Back to back phone calls of being yelled at all day. Felt like a zombie after the end of 10 hour work shifts, I see why there is such a fast turn over. There is opportunity for advancement if you can survive the environment long enough."
bad,"The work as fine and interesting. It is like a puzzle that you are the only one who knows where to find the missing piece. My colleagues were great and provided a lot of emotional support and humor.  Management was unsatisfactory. During my time there the managers were rude and disrespectful. We called our weekly team meetings ""insult Thursdays"". I think it could have been a great job if the management was replaced with people who knew what they wee doing and cared about their employees."
bad,"Hire freezes and inability to look for more challenging opportunities and poor health benefit options make this a poor place to build your career.  If just starting out, it would be best to look elsewhere."
bad,you  have to be able to handle high call volume and high pressure to get sales quota and not to mention that you may not get a good supervisor that is very helpful
bad,"Xerox was all about productivity.  At the beginning of my employment I thoroughly enjoyed working with this company as you treated fairly and you loved going to work and giving the company 100 % of your work life.  "
bad,"Conduent spun off from Xerox in January of 2017. As part of the spin off, it was necessary to reduce staff by 10%. this is what is occurring now, making morale not good."
bad,"Layoffs are always being considered by management. There are no plans to expand the company only cut costs.While the workers try to be loyal and work hard, it is difficult to do when the upper management seems to focus on cutting cost instead of creating new projects for out customers."
bad,"you will be required to sit for extremely long periods. You can only get up from your seat for your 15 min breaks and for your 30-60 min lunch break. "
bad,"Xerox is an alright job if you make it through training , but my best advice for anyone would be to stay to yourself amazon is a very drama filled place."
bad,"Xerox is not an organized company.  No one has an established cubical, you are expected to hot seat it daily.  While working there they had an infestation of bed bugs and did not close the office down until the infestation was gone."
bad,"9 years spent with the company. I've volnteered to work evenings, and required to work 3 weekends a month with on call rotations. Was only provided one day off as ""compensation"". A remote day once a week would probably have prevented me from leaving. "
bad,it was a stressful job. The pay was small based on the job you were expected to do. I really enjoyed worlking with my coworkers and helping the clients.
bad,"I enjoy helping others, the hardest part of the job is not allowing enough time to review case after a call & then receiving a QA lower than 90% was not good & each QA rep reviewed differently.  the enjoyable part about the job was i was able to help others & met some amazing people."
bad,Really standard boring contract call center job. The same thing all day and then repeat till the center was shut down and all the employees were laid off due to poor management.
bad,"Too many people in upper management making decisions that were not conducive to the working environment.  Worked for company for 9 years and never received a raise.  My salary was based off of production work that I earned before being promoted.  I was always told there was a freeze on raises, then when it was time for a raise, I was told I had maxed out."
bad,The company will bring you in and tell you that you will be working for 6 months and let you go un-expectantly in 3 months and will wait for the end of your shift to let you go.
bad,The job was excited at times and very stressful with goals and metrics throughout the work day. Talking on the phone all day becomes a headache. but overall the employee were a lot of fun
bad,"The hours were long and the job was tedious and boring, I like to be busy all the time and there were days when it was really slow with not much to do."
bad,"Management needs proper direction. Does not pay well, high attrition. No sense of taking care of their own properly. No competent leadership. Don't recommend."
bad,"Not a real good place to work for, poor management. We changed companies in Jan 2017 was supposed to be the ""call center of the future"" when it changed to Conduent. Then 3 months later the company closes its doors."
bad,Telephone call center. They offered promotions to top performers which was good but they had a hard time treating employees with dignity and respect. Don't think I remember anyone happy working for them.
bad,"QualityControl Specialist. QC check of processors works to decrease errors. I really feel the work environment could have been so much better. No raises were given for more than 5 years. The name kept changing, but nothing else. It would have been nice to have management that truly cared. The most rewarding aspects were to know I really tried to help people."
bad,"While my immediate supervisor was very nice the rest of the job was very stressful and non stop.  we were to preform for the healthcare enrollment time for at least 6 months.  One day the supervisor had to let the whole group go because the NC branch took it over!  there were overload system problems, crying clients, constant phone calls with 3 seconds to document. overtime was constant."
bad,"Empresa Regular para se trabalhar, sem grandes benefícios"
bad,"talk to customers all day, make sure to be postive, dont get mad, customers are always right when it comes to customer service, solve the problems, work smart, be respectful"
bad,"The job does not reward it's employees enough.  Also, the management is usually in inept hands.  There needs to be better people at the top and more direction."
bad,"The company informed us in the beginning that is our contract with our client ever was stopped, there would be another client to come in and take over. We were promised many different benefits, but nothing ever came to fruition. Very stressful environment most of the time."
bad,Ok company need better benefits management was not great its need to be more professional learned different things by teaching my self hope they can change for the future
bad,just another call center job. front line assault from customers who feel they are getting ripped off by the phone company. its a 50/50 deal here. people should have their plans explained totally
bad,Requires a lot of verbal skills and patience as you work with customers to resolve their issues.  sometimes your best will not be enough.  The headache may not be worth the pay.
bad,"A typical day at work was spending 10 hours at work, forced to do overtime when I needed time at home, taking calls from abusive customers and fighting supervisors in fixing their problems. I learned that there are times where you need to buckle down and fix the problem yourself. And patience, lots of patience. Management was terrible. They fight you on every little thing possible and then sit you down once a week and do their best to make you feel inferior and unintelligent after a long day of getting the same from the people just on the other side of the headset. Workplace culture is fine, really female-oriented and diverse. Hardest part of the job was getting through the work day, especially when you put in time off for grievance and they reject it. Had to miss a family member's funeral because the job refused to accept my time off. Only enjoyable thing about the job was the late night shift, when the calls were slow and you could talk with your fellow agents and laugh."
bad,"As with any call center, they just burn through people without concern for anyone but themselves. When initially hired, I was one of 35-ish people, when I was let go 90 days later, perhaps five were left. And all in all they don't care. Guess they don't need to. A few of the managers were okay, but seriously overshadowed by the absolute jerks who don't care. Save your time and get a real job."
bad,Overall Xerox was an okay company at best. The culture was that of hard working people whom were not sufficiently compensated nor showed respect for their work.
bad,"Customer service is stressful as it is, but when you get management telling you to do something then trying to fire you for doing it, it can be very stressful."
bad,the working environment wasn't the most professional. I didn't enjoy working there. I would not apply there again. Hours are pretty good and they did allow overtime.
bad,"Call center environment"
bad,"By far one of the most tumultuous environment I have ever worked at and I would never recommend this."
bad,poor equipment training vs service management expectations. they are more worried about client perception than employees.
bad,"Poor work space, a lot of employees engaging in inter office relationships, supervisors and managers do not like to help resolve customer issues. Were promised raises but that never happened"
bad,Management does not care about the employees or how the job gets done. There are no raises and job advancement for anyone. When someone does try to improve things they get kicked out.
bad,I enjoyed working on the Ignite Education Team!  Each day I was busy.  Always met my goals.  I was a very strong performer. Had a superior boss.  Team culture was excellent.
bad,"Xerox was a good job based upon the pay.  Other than that, job security is something that is a worry, based upon performance and the quick fast-paced, ever changing environment. "
bad,"contato com o cliente, através do webex. reuniões diárias com departamentos internos. definição e controlo de medidas de implementação. gestão de projetos à escala global. contato com várias culturas e diferentes maneiras de trabalhar. liderança presencial e virtual."
bad,"I learned how to fix any problems on a cell phone. Management was not good at all they treated their employees like dirt. My hardest part of my job was the managers . A typical day at work was answering phone calls, and assisting customers with cell phone bills and problems with their phones."
bad,Very low pay for the work that you did. This resulted in high turn over and they would hire anybody as a result who was willing to work for that pay so it made everything worse.
bad,"Came in, Sat down put headset on, and begin taking a non stop bombardment of agitated customers, this created a lot of stress that also carried over into my personal life making me highly irritable and random fits of anger."
bad,You walk in feeling the day is too long before you clock in. Continuous changes weekly and specialist are usually the last to know leaving very little room for preparation. None transparent
bad,It was mostly a call center for verizon wireless. You had a day shift and a night shift where you sat at a desk on the computer most of your time. Surveys are where you make your money.
bad,"Er worden vaal verwachtingen en eisen gesteld aan de functie. Er zijn nauwelijks gestroomlijnde procedures."
bad,This is one of the worst run companies I have seen I a very long time. Definitely an opportunity to better pay their employees and appreciate them.  Managers need better raining as well.
bad,This was a great environment to work in I enjoyed the people I worked with but this place was not organized at all. They placed anybody in a supervisor position.
bad,long hour that did not pay well enough for the amount of pressure that was put on me. the training did no adequately teach me how to perform well.
bad,Only benefit is being able to work from home.  Upper management lacked direction.  Company does not communicate among teams.  Everyone is on their own.
bad,"My typical day at work, focusing on getting the job done in a timing matter. Xerox helped me gained a lot of experiences. Which I'm very grateful for that. I worked well with my co-workers, we worked as a team player. the most enjoyable part of the job, I like what I was doing."
bad,"Xerox is a company where you'll have to adjust periodically. There a new rules placed all the time, so it might be suited best for people who like change. It's a very easy job, but a lot of people there are very unprofessional I.e managers."
bad,"this is a ghetto comapny, when i applied for the job it took them 3 hours to interview me, when i came back for my drug test i was there for 4 hours. they don't give bouns, there no floor support at all no help"
bad,Organization lacks direction and is constantly re-organizing with same management structure expecting a different outcome. Salaries increases never happen as well a bonuses.
bad,"Most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the people I support and fixing technical issues they have."
bad,I received inbound calls from KY residents who needed to register for the KY Affordable Health Care Act.  I assisted people with online applications for healthcare. I answered questions regarding their healthcare options for health and dental care.
bad,"Xerox is an ok employer. However they take advantage of their employees and don't value them. Xerox doesn't take employees work life into consideration when scheduling thier employees, nor do they stick by what they promise."
bad,"Xerox is a very busy and stressful workplace. They have to approve the PTO you've requested, so you may or may not get to use the pto that you earned, even if it is an emergency. The people there are not always helpful. They messed up my W-4 form and then said they didn't have it because they shred all important documents after hire. My co-workers however were good people and helped me when I was in need. The hardest part of the job is dealing with getting yelled at all the time by callers. They never gave me my raise that I was supposed to get after a year of working there."
bad,Xerox -TMS Healthcare is a very unprofessional place to work.  The company does not follow any guidelines that most professional companies follow.  The company does not even supply their employees with writing utensils like pens or pads of paper.  The company does not recognize that it is more expensive to hire and train a new employee than it does to keep an experienced employee motivated and respected.
bad,Just another outsource vendor call center. My site was free to change our schedule and even our job title with little to no notice. Our entire sites job title changed from wireless tech support to supporting residential sales with only two days notice. I did not have a supervisor for two months and basically lead all of my own coaching. The people are great but management seemed out of touch with their employees and only did things to satisfy the client. I recall multiple occasions where I asked about a policy and everyone just placed the blame on the client and what they want. Sales/up selling is a huge metric at this location.
bad,Please see the prior review offered for the company Xerox Mortgage Services.   This should suffice for answering any questions concerning the company.
bad,It's an ok job to gain experience and insight in software development. I only wish that there was more opportunities for growth.
bad,Management is terrible. The job itself is fine. The management team is very unprofessional. The environment is very stressful.
bad,Unprofessional work ethic by some  management and co-workers. Inappropriate work attire worn. Alot of inappropriate language used in the work place.
bad,"Through out the 7 months of working there is was miserable. If the pay wasn't so good i would have left sooner. Not only is the company as a whole terrible, but so is the management. I had to deal with people cussing me out and calling me stupid and an idiot on a daily basis, yes I know that's what I get for working at a call center but when I'm in the right and nothing I can do or supervisor can do but just say take it, can drive someone insanse. I also felt bad for most customers because the services hardly worked, sometimes there would be planned outages and nothing we can do and if they want a credit we have to give it to them but forbid you go over your credit limit. Also an entire lack of communication from management and employees. I would never recommend this job to anyone."
bad,The management team caters to too many sensitive complaints and treats them serious. Anybody that complains about another person puts that persons job at risk. That is no good. They make changes to company and do not communicate the changes to the training classes.
bad,Enjoyed working with customers. Management uneven and unpredictable. Excellent training. Insufficient wage structure to match seniority and skills.
bad,Benefits were ok but compensation was barely above minimum wage. No opportunity for advancement and there was no job security. Worked everyday afraid it would be my last
bad,"All employees are treated like children, and compensated as such. Supervisors and managers use fear-based tactics in order to get as much work out of everyone for as little as possible. Recently, half of our staff was laid off only to place the responsibilities of all their positions on those who remained. We now work two entirely different positions for the same pay. Upon hiring we were told we would be working for bonuses based on the quantity of work we completed, which was a lie. Xerox also does not abide by CT labor laws as we are reprimanded whenever we take a sick day (full-time workers should get 40 hours without punishment). There is no room for advancement, and promotions, when given, are based on how long you've been employed rather than merit. College degrees are required for a starting pay of $15 an hour. Icing on the cake: they expect us to pay for our own Employee Appreciation Day."
bad,"Accepted a contract to Xerox for Project Management. Once onsite I was given about 6 projects that had zero documentation and no historical data to go by except word of mouth from my immediate supervisor. "
bad,I really think people need to be more professional. This could be a great job if things would be looked at closely. Hopefully it gets better.
bad,"typical day"
bad,"Xerox has many site, however the site I work at could do much better. From the hours they offer to the management they have. Asking for any kind of help with a problem you have is like fighting tooth and nail. Im also in a room full of people and maybe no three peoples names."
bad,cuts breaks and lunches not to make up for the amnmount of time in a day that you work\ practices major unethical background towards employees
bad,Repetitive work. Favoritism takes precedence over expertise and knowledge when it comes to role progression. Communication gap from management down the line. Favoritism in terms of providing work life balance.
bad,"My typical day at work is training to be a call center customer support representative. I learn that it is a very fast paced environment and you learn something new everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you were able to resolve a customer's concern or issue and the hardest part of the job is when no matter how hard you tried to assist your customer, they still left the call unhappy."
bad,Good company to work for unless you get hurt then they don't care.  Company was in new stages of opening and contruction thru out the building.  No bathrooms for people who are hurt unless they can walk  all the way to the other side of the building and only allowed 3-4 minutes person breaks.
bad,Company is ok. The equipment isn't good. New equipment need to be purchased. Training in class was fun. Training on the phone is another story.
bad,Employees are treated unfairly. not a good work environment. to many chiefs not enough Indians. There was some racism going in the work place.
bad,"I don't mind working in an inbound cancellation call center. The team I have is amazing, and they make it fun. The benefits are great. The management leaves much to be desired, as its essentially impossible to get assistance or information from anyone that has the information. I disagree with the style, as it is more of a dictatorship instead of a team. The hardest part of the job is dealing with supervisors, as they are constantly not working on the things they need to. The best and easiest part of the day is dealing with the customers, as they are usually much easier to talk to and get information from."
bad,"At first, I loved working here, but the more time goes on, the less I like working here.Answering phones all day and not being able to move can be frustrating. What doesn't help the situation is when so much pressure is placed on the employees."
bad,"Please see the title, as it states all that you need to know.  apply anywhere else but here. It is an office full of temps. That is all I have to say"
bad,"First off, the staff could do a way better job training. They put you in a classroom for 5 weeks making you copy notes and look at a projector and take tests. Then the final week they choose to put you on a computer with little to no help. Finally when your on the floor working alone their is really no one of authority to assist you. The other staff rarely wants to help and your stuck looking deer! The pros to this job is basically the pay. The pay and hours is whats good about it. Kinda flexible with your schedule most of the time it has to benefit themselves. I worked for 2 weeks before i found another job! Very high turnover rate! Apply at your own risks!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,This company is very unorganized and the management team is very insufficient for licensed agents because they are not required to be licensed.
bad,"Xerox experiences can very, but I have never herd of any one being sad to leave. There are supervisors who do treat there employees really well and there are supervisors who abuse their power. Bad pay but it could all ways be worse."
bad,"Very unprofessional and unorganized work place. Job description does not coincide with the pay. Turn over rate is terrible. The only upside would be a select few of my coworkers, which is also one of the biggest downsides."
bad,Basically a high school environment. Supervisors really didn't care about the employees. They were not sure of their positions
bad,"The job itself was not difficult at all and the hours were decent. I was Employed by Xerox but Out sourced through Verizon Wireless."
bad,I strongly believe that since the company is just really starting to get started there are many systems error that is taken time to correct.
bad,Learning experience . Management need a little work but seems to care for their employee. Good place to learn good customer service
bad,The company that I currently work for has taught me a lot over the past year and assisted me with my customer service skills
bad,"Management acts like they don't want to help, they act like its high school and people talk about each other like there is nothing else to do."
bad,Good balance between work and family. Good solid employees. Culture has changed.  Health care is expensive and a solid hit to your  salary.
bad,"A typical day would consist of taking technical support calls and assisting with whatever issues the customer may have. They amount of day to day work was dependent upon the amount of call volume received for that day."
bad,"Temp job, thru a temp agency. I was looking for permanent work but this position ended up being only temporary. "
bad,"I'm not going to rant and rave on here, but I will say that this company, even though I have been with them for almost a year and a half and I should expect nothing less, this company is only out for themselves, not the well being of their employees."
bad,"Been working here for over a year. Starts pretty ok but after a while you realize it's draining you like crazy. The equipment never works and they force you to work under broken equipment. Heavy stress from calls it's a thing you know you have to deal with, but the stress the management puts on you and how things work makes it worse. They force you to leave customers happy while they make your employee experience a misery. Pretty good as a stepping stone of a job to move to something else. The Healthcare and your workmates are the only good things. Pays very poorly for the humongous amount of work you have to do. Don't ever belive in the ""incentives"", they're made in a way you'll be lucky to win them once or twice. Have fun with the callers, make the call pleasant because the job won't be."
bad,"No Comment about this company, I was a long term employee for 20 years with no advancement over the last 9 years. The direction of the company changes each day and it is only focused on the numbers. Its about the employees! this is not true. A company all about politics not what makes sense to do for the customer."
bad,"I really liked learning new medical terms as well as becoming well versed in Health insurance. I enjoyed the relationship I had with my fellow coworkers, however the lack of support from management and team leads lead to a lot of confusion and lack of new opportunity. Also, the job was incredibly scripted - it was very difficult to be personable with clients when having to read straight from a script. Overall, not a terrible place to work though."
bad,"I would go the call center and log on to my workstation and start taking inbound calls for about7.45 hours."
bad,Management does not care and good luck getting a decent raise ever.Xerox does not care about cost of living or your goals. They make excuses year after.
bad,update customers payment history and make sure they have the right products on their account. I was able to switch phone number to other phones and also was able to provide basic trouble shooting
bad,"I like the job but the management needs work, as well as the team leads, they are very rude at times and dot run a proper business"
bad,Working from home is great. Like the flex time and working at your own pace. Working from home allow you to have more freedom to do others things such as attending appointments without losing time from work.
bad,Communication is not the best. Employees are only a number and are treated as such! The only good thing is the people you work with. From all around the globe
bad,"Empresa com forte tendencia a treinamento de funcionários, especialmente de vendas."
bad,"You do not get any raises, there are no goals to reach, you work every day just for a pay check that is all you will not get compensated for working extra hard. It is like you are a slave just working to work there are no benefits nor raises the only good thing is that you can leave work when ever you want because if you do not work well you do not get paid, ""your hours your pay.' There is no PTO and for holidays you are forced to take them off and you do not get paid for them even if you do not celebrate these days. Overall this job is easy, it just sucks because thats it you will never be anything with this company unless you stay here for your whole like for the same pay."
bad,"I am contracted out from Xerox to another agency.  My management at Xerox is not educated on Xerox policies or procedures, and often refer me to other divisions within Xerox, who in turn and refer me back to my manager.   "
bad,"On the phone 8-10 hours a day,management could be better,co workers were great,hardest part was if they had technical issues trying to get help for them.  Most enjoyable part was talking to the customers."
bad,"I enjoy the members I speak to on a daily, but this is a new company so there are a lot of changes without much notice. My coworkers are like a dysfunctional family, but we get through and motivate one another. Supervisors are nice but are new to this job as well."
bad,They have made it almost impossible to be successful within the institution. They give almost no direction and change territories over and over to point that you cannot be successful. they constantly change their business plan and never help with gaining new accounts.
bad,"I volunteered in the radiology department which I enjoyed. I made sure patients had whatever they needed before the procedures"
bad,"The job itself is very stressful being that you take approximately 90-120 inbound calls each day as a Customer Service Rep. Almost every consumer is very upset about their situation. My position or superiors did not grant  me enough authority or tools to assist the majority of our clients with their issues. Which seemed to make our position and responsibilities somewhat insignificant. Also, the supervisors, who where there mainly for administrative work and to help the CSRs, did not offer enough support to help us be effective. The company actually messed up my payroll several times and shorted a few paychecks on a few occasions, I reported my problem to my supervisor and the issue was never resolved. Now they are being sued for Loss of Wages by some former employees."
bad,"Xerox is a company that has many clients who we work for. Most of them are Health Insurance. A typical day at work is answering phone calls with a 30 minute lunch and a 15 minute break. Very calm environment, with a great sense of professionalism. We learned to navigate through many systems at once on the computer to confirm all information for the providers, such as doctors, chiropractors, and etc. My fellow co-workers are always willing to help out when there's a question. The hardest part of the job is making sure the provider does not have to call back for the same situation. We always want first call resolution. The enjoyable part is getting to know your team and making the environment fun to be in."
bad,"OK place but too far from home, department was slowing down and lots of people were let go so it was time to move on. Learned a lot about scanners."
bad,"The work/life balance was great. "
bad,"You must either know some one or have big breast in order to advance within the company. General Manager is known for these two things, including changing/altering policies to accommodate any of his ""star"" (big breasted) employees.  One day you have a job & you are told to be ready for an excellent working year then next you are been told your hours will be reduced. Also you work hard to get any extra incentive you can to be able to provide better for your family and you are given dates of the month on which to expect that bonus but then that day comes and you are told you wont be getting that money until next paycheck, and you would be lucky to really get it on the next paycheck. Overall the only great time in this company is if you really enjoy talking to customers & knowing somehow you are helping them have a better day."
bad,"Xerox is an equal opportunity employer that is a great job to have when you are needing a paycheck in between jobs. It is however, highly stressful with the requirements in order to get a decent paycheck. Many people who have worked there and meet all the requirements still have difficulty earning anything above the minimum pay at $10/hour. This job also requires that you work a minimum of 45 hours per week. There is no room for part time. This is a work place that takes a lot out of you and doesn't leave a lot of time for anything other than sleep and work."
bad,I heavily did not enjoy working there but it was something while I was in college. I cared too much about my job and doing a good job at it with people acting immature and constantly undermining me. There was quite a bit of inappropriateness at the workplace.
bad,The pay system is pretty weird and there is a lot of problems with the system. We do get a lot of calls and most for order questions and issues with the ordering process. Management could use more help. Co-worker are good and helpful when they can be. Hardest is angry member who want a supervisor there could be more supervisors for the on-going issues. Most enjoyable is clocking out.
bad,The interview and the job were totally different then presented. No training at all. I was on the phone after 3 days.
bad,Filling medications for the clients who's insurance is send through the mail. Right Source. Calling for new RX for the clients. Helping take care of balances over the phone.
bad,A typical day at the office is having to make yourself known to the right people or you do not get anything.
bad,"If you can put personal feelings aside, this is a good place to work. "
bad,Does not have good management.  Very unorganized. No diversity. No opportunity to excel. Typical day at work will be whatever management or work flows decide. Easy job but not worth the hassle and stress management adds to the job.
bad,Lamentablemente el ambiente labor siempre es malo producto a la posibilidad constante de que te despidan por recorte de personal. Lo que me paso personalemnte por que me despidieron sin causa.
bad,"The job itself is good,but be-aware of political things and BS.No growth for advancement and if you deal with the management at Airport it will be the worst thing you every encounter. You will be constantly looking behind your back and always covering your rear. Team is good,but management is the worst onsite with manipulation and corruption for you will be treated as a child. be sure to document everything to HR."
bad,Xerox is the highest paying in the document or office equipment industry. They know they are so they aren't too worried about you leaving elsewhere so pay cuts come abruptly across the board and they have no real future goals that seem consistent as every January first there is a new company direction meeting. Often dumping last years version. Top heavy company looking to cut off its own knees.
bad,My Job there was just that just a job. There was very unprofessional staff and very little training for sensitive Medicare accounts.
bad,"Xerox is a multinational company. I am under Michelin Account, assigned as Accounts Payable- Vendor Master Analyst."
bad,This company does not provide enough training for its employees. I was an at home advisor and they just basically threw us out there after 4 weeks of training which consisted of us look at slides for 8 hours a day.
bad,es una empresa que se preocupa en capacitar a su personal para que pueda brindar una buena atencion al cliente el clima labora es agradable donde se puede disfrutar del compañerismo donde nos ayudamos mutuamente ante cualquier percanse  y la gerencia es una parte mur importante por que es la que se preocupa por que tengas buenas herramientas de trabajo para brindar un buen servicio
bad,"This Location was a joke. It has its perks of the amount of money you can make, and is not hard to make the money but it a whole lot easier to loose the copensation you have worked for. room for advancement works on a  favoritism bases so if your name is not known through the grapevine good luck climbimng the scale to success."
bad,review is the same. this was simply a lower position for the same company.
bad,Training needs a great deal of improvement. Training is not sufficient. Very unorganized
bad,"Its a call center so the pace was fast ."
bad,no support from management and managers but my co workers help me to solve all problems and they are my friends also so help any time and any where and they gave leads to pick sales
bad,everyone who works here is motivated to do well.  if upper management would look to invest local workforce and reporting administration it would cut down on the workload that cannot possibly get done with proficiency.  creates chaos.
bad,"Awesome place to work and need for attention essential, Manager is awesome to work for"
bad,"If you ask me and I known to be very honest. When I was hired, I was hired to do a job. It started that way, I loved my job and the people I worked with. Yeah I worked in a basement with little sun light and no ventilation but it was still fun. There were games and at first they cared about you. Things started to change when all of a sudden we weren't meeting our numbers."
bad,"A typical work day for me would consist of quoting benefits and claims summary to providers for their patients. I also am apart of the email team where we communicate with providers about their claims. I am a step up supervisor which the name was just changed to a team leader. I am responsible for a team off about 15 or more agents.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the different personalities and adapting to changed, but my co-workers make it worth coming back to everyday."
bad,"Verified information, operated data entry devices and prepared documents. I processed account information, customer information, and a variety of other forms of documents by resolving inconsistencies and reviewing data for errors using standard data entry. Entered information into specific files or forms from recorded material, hand written pages or figures contained in printed files. I kept records of asks, files and proofread reports."
bad,"Work for Verizon but under Xerox's name. You have to deal with 2 different types of standards. Very difficult to get through the training when the trainers take favorites and let you flounder. "
bad,"A typical day is a stressful one, just like any other work place. However, generally it gets easier, which it did in some aspects. If there was anything this job taught me it was to have God-like patience when dealing with management. The best way to deal, is just shake your head and smile despite the fact that some management likes to hold grudges."
bad,"It was all over the place, it was'nt organized tthe training the shift you was going to work, it seemed very un-organized. I learned how to help people with Medicare Enrollment. Managment was always switching up. Co-workers were fun to be with. The hardest part of my job was learning my job through training. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the elderly."
bad,"•a typical day at work"
bad,"poor management hard to deal with on a daily basis, lacked ethics "
bad,"The best part of the job was the enviornment was very comfortable. "
bad,"The training was great, my instructor was wonderful and made work enjoyable especially since you were sitting in a room for 8 hours a day with minimal breaks. Once you are on the floor taking calls the environment is great! Almost everyone enjoys each other, they make it fun and easy to adjust to. The calls could be good or bad, you have to have tough skin and a great outlook to be able to get back out there and answer more sometimes. Most enjoyable part of the job was the way everyone treated each other, it was greta and easy to make friends. The hardest part of the job is the calls you received daily. Management for the most part was good, i think out of the 4 i had i only disliked one. Also, Changing your schedule is incredibly hard and everyone has to like bet for their schedule based on ranking within the location."
bad,The hardest part of work was the unprofessional atmosphere and the lack of the supervisors.
bad,Over worked. Under paid. No life outside of optum. I wouldn't recommend this company for employment
bad,there was no room for advancement from the bottom. A typical day was ok not to hard of work. Management could have been better many problems came about mostly between employees. most enjoyable part about the job was location.
bad,The actual job was good.  The environment was awful. Not many good things to say about Xerox.
bad,A typical work day is from 8am to 5pm Monday through Friday. Worked closely with Sr Finance Manager to things done on a timely manner. Communicated with vendors to resolve any payment issue. Very good team spirit with co-workers. The hardest part of my job was management. The Management system is very poor with so many approvals needed for purchase to be made. I enjoyed preparing budget and forecasts.
bad,worked on computer customer service had fun worked with customers
bad,"pay wasn't good"
bad,I gave this job 2 stars due to the organization the upper management had.
bad,Very relaxed atmosphere. Managers required to much on associates with little gain on the return.
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,"While I enjoyed my managers, I had been offered $11 an hour and only got $9.50 an hour. The clean desk policy also meant I always worked at least 50 hours a week, but sometimes worked 55-60 and had to come in Saturdays. The management often bought us lunch when that happened though. Also, there was a huge mold problem that went ignored despite multiple complaints and we had a mouse problem. I'm a PhD student and  finally quit because I was exhausted and didn't have the time or energy to find another job."
bad,"A typical day at work is greeting my team, making sure all my employees are ready for work. Handle any issues that my employees might have or answer any questions. Check my email to is if there is any new updates that need to be reported to my team. Start my coaching's for the day, reviewing my employees' stats and discussing any areas that they might need to work on. I have learned that each one of my employees are different and learn in a different way. So as a supervisor I would take note on how each one of my employees learns and coach based on their different learning habits. The best part of my job is looking at my employees achieve goals they didn't think were achievable. The hardest part of my job is delivering corrective actions to employees that have been working hard but still can't achieve certain goals."
bad,I have been there for one year. This is a call center environment.
bad,A typical day has me starting at 7am in the morning to prepare MTD reports since the ERP system has no reporting features at all
bad,"This was a temp to permanent position that I obtained through a employment agency.  I was there 3 months.  They hired approximately 10 quality assurance reps.  Then one day they let three of us go.  The manager or supervisor from xerox never gave us an evaluation of our work, and we were just told to drop off our badges and that was it.  I later received a call from the employment agency, informing me that because of lack of work, i was let go.  I left a stable job with T-Mobile, in an attempt to advance my career.  "
bad,"Nice company, fast paced , nice people  to work with. the call volume is high but it make your day go fast."
bad,"Xerox is a fortune 500 company and there are opportunities to advance if you're lucky. The company offers pretty much unlimited overtime which is nice if you have the determination to stick through long days. On top on the unlimited voluntary overtime there is also mandatory one hour of overtime for all employees either prior to or after your scheduled shift."
bad,"Anyone who knows the name ACS knows how this place operates,. I dont really need to get into it. Perfect job for someone who is just starting out and learning customer service. Not a lifelong job."
bad,"The job is good in terms of pay but the supervisors and operations managers are never on the same page. The OMs are more concerned about their numbers than anything; they have no problem not following proper procedure as long as they're number are good. The workplace resembles a high school with all the backstabbing and favoritism. Overall, its a good temporary job but it's definitely not worth staying."
bad,"They will hire anyone and everyone for the most part.  You can have a tattoo on your face and you'll get the job.  There is no motivation to do your job the honest and right way, your pay is based on surveys that are the majority of the time out of your control.  The management is your clique-like giant call center hierarchy of drama and laziness.  Your supervisor will not care about you or your customer and will do everything in his or her power to AVOID doing any kind of work other than lecturing you."
bad,"The coworkers are fine, its a great place to stop, not settle."
bad,"We never knew from one day to the next how many hours we would work, it all depended on how much mail came in that day.  They never gave us an idea of how long we would be there or how many trays of mail came in that day, so it was common for people to work 6, 7, 8 hours and take no lunch break (a violation of labor laws, by the way).  People didn't want to take a lunch because they were afraid other people would do all the work while they were gone.  And we only got a puny 30 min. lunch which wasn't even enough time to go anywhere and get a decent meal."
bad,"The management was very nice and treated you with respect.  The pay and benefits are HORRIBLE!!!!  For such a large company you would think they would have more to offer.  There is room for, but only if you are willing to work a lot of including weekends.  As a supervisor/trainer I was not micro-managed like the agents on the phone were.  Their breaks/lunches are timed to the second.  Overall not a good experience would love to have the same managers in a different work environment!"
bad,"Faulty chain of command, poor moral, uncomfortable working conditions"
bad,Laid off same day walked out.  we were doing a great job.  Manager was as shocked as we were about layoff.  Upper management made all decisions about layoffs.
bad,"its a job, not ideal. "
bad,however there 10 commitments are not followed correctly. nice mgr and good job. not clean 
bad,"pretty open environment"
bad,"ACS was bad enough - with no career advancement, unfair performance reviews with no avenue to reconcile differences, and no compensation increases in years.  After acquisition by Xerox, ACS was treated like step children and ACS's acquisition of eHRO from HP brought more staff and no new clients in the pipeline."
bad,"Xerox had no HR department on site, so they had what they called an ""open door"" policy where you were able to walk into anyones office to voice a complaint or ask questions. Several members of my training class had to do this multiple times with a few different people in management positions with issues of drug selling/possession, alcohol use in the building, HIPAA violations, among other things. Minimal efforts were made by management to correct these issues. When I was offered the job originally I was told I would be working friday - tuesday for 7 weeks. with schedule changes we lost two days of training before they shorted our training to four weeks."
bad,"Where to start; first getting out to the Webster location requires braving the 590 North route if you're coming from Rochester. The bridge gets reduced to one lane at times so you're looking at SEVERE traffic jams."
bad,"After 6+ years of supporting at least 12 and as many as 19 call centers with only myself and one other engineer, I've learned one thing; I'm a line item on a spreadsheet at the corporate level."
bad,I worked for this company for about 3 months. The training was shameful. They were unorganized and trained on only about half of what you needed to know. They got you out onto the floor after 6 wks of training. They promised high quality scores for the company they were working for. Once you got onto the floor and started to answer calls you found not only were you not taught everything you needed to succeed the Mngmnt had no clue how to answer your questions.Knowing that the training was bad and most of the people on the floor were getting bad quality scores they called about half of the workers in and fired us instead of trying a retrain. The place is a JOKE!!! If you work for these clowns don't get to comfortable!!
bad,i cant really explain it's all too much. if your desperate then by all means but if not run
bad,"Frozen promotions, no raises 3 out of 4 years (though they were SUPPOSED to have happened during one of those years, bringing it to 2 of 4 years, but didn't) Changing business model leaving those who created the brand with nothing. Benefits not worth mentioning."
bad,"It is an okay job, just the hours do not allow for much of a life."
bad,el ambiente muy tranquilo y aprendes a relacionarte con todo tipo de clientes y siempre trabajas de forma individual y grupal por obtener buenos logros en calidad de llamadas .
bad,"Management does not care at all about their employee or employee needs. I went to HR requesting documentation for proof of income. Management pointed me in all different directions for 2 weeks without taking any action to help. Management is only focused on their demands without caring about employee needs. The lack of effort from management in not providing these documents caused me to lose the apt. i was applying for....to make matters worse, I and I had nowhere to liv then they fired me for missing a day because because I was without without a home... All stemming from their lack of concern for employee needs and a simple written document i needed for an apt and had been requesting for 2 weeks"
bad,Please note the entity of Xerox I was employed by was formerly ACS which is an autocratic and bureaucratic organization.
bad,"As a customer service rep, I had to take many calls per day, typically, I would arrive at the building search for a cubicle that was moderately clean and get started taking calls. The job consisted of providing customer support for one of the 4 major cellular service providers. The hardest part of the job was making sure customers were happy with your resolution to their troubles, as the pay was set up in a manor in which the customer's opinion of you through after call surveys directly affected the per hour flexible pay rate. Management on the call center has been sporadic, with a lack of support for agents on the production floor and high turnover within the supervisory staff."
bad,"Xerox is attempting to be a services company, yet outsources a ton of its own business. HP does tech support for Xerox. A lot of development has moved overseas because the same talent in India is a lot cheaper."
bad,"After working for both Xerox Commercial Solutions and Xerox Federal Solutions, I've found the ease of the job depends on how understanding your managers are, and whether they see you as a person or a number. From my experience, the commercial side seems to treat people like cattle, projects tend to offer either job security or advancement (not both), and the benefits are few, often expensive/taxing, and usually do not compensate for the workload and expectations."
bad,"Working at Xerox took my life away from me, being a 20 year old looking into going to college there was no way I would ever be able to advance anywhere but within the Xerox company. It is required to work 40 hours a week, and I was working 45 because of mandatory overtime. People are very rude to you on the phone and off, I wouldn't recommend living.....I mean ""working"" here."
bad,No flexablilty in the company. with little to no incenitives or orportunities to advance.
bad,Xerox as a corporation seems to be progressive. The company however that was taken over by Xerox ACS leaves a lot to be desired.
bad,"when i first get to work the day begins with taking calls range from 55-87 a day,i learned new things everyday because things changed on a daily basis,managers was ok some of them was all about them and there team and did not care about other people and some talked down to you,being yelled at all day,it was easy"
bad,"Xerox, formerly ACS, can be a great place to work. The pay isn't very high, especially if you're a skilled professional."
bad,"I enjoyed helping member over the phone with medicare pdp and medicare advantage medical coverage but the company itself had little regard for the employees....Paying $9.00 per hour, the company thought nothing of sending you home after you had arrived at work because ""they didn't need you today""....I found that very disrespectful of an employee's time and budget to ask them to return home after they had taken the time and gone to the expense of arriving to work on time."
bad,Micro management. Numerous gotchas
bad,Not a road that I would like to travel again but thankful for the opportunity....
bad,I like the job I did but the environment wasn't the best from
bad,IF you know someone or are a newly grad from a school on a approved Xerox list you might get hired.
bad,"Exciting industry to work in. People & culture are very accommodating and enjoyable to work for/with. "
bad,"I have learned immensely due to continual reductions in force with the expectation of having to assume open workloads and full expectation and responsibility of workloads. Best thing about the job is seeing my contributions in operation and the global scope and reach of a fully functional IT environment. Hardest part is the acute management silence and ongoing turnover, HR RIF/IRIF actions, funding."
bad,"Benefits and pay were not that great. I actually enjoyed my job, however the company is not willing to pay. Worked there for a total of 10 years with only 2 raises, as the company always stated they were on a pay freeze."
bad,Very bad place for work most jobs moving to India. Every 3 months they layoff people or bring people from India to training. All jobs are temporary. Not suggest anybody to go.
bad,"Not much to say here, it was an alright place to work but by no means a good place to extend your career. Management does not promote workers that do 110%, they would rather keep them in their current posts. No Employer loyalty."
bad,Worked Xerox for many  years and pay hasn’t changed much at all. I do more work  now for same money.There are a lot changes happening and a lot of jobs being offshored. Many people who been there a long time losing their jobs and some leaving because of joe security.
bad,Didn't like the fact that they lie to us about ABC. New sup was the worse sup ever. She puts u down and basically tells you that your stupid. When you confront her she say it's not true. Force us to work so hard we skip out break and lunch sometimes just to get work done.
bad,Xerox was once a great company to work for. I was there quite a long time and would have stayed but due to many missed opportunities the company is no longer a great one.
bad,"Very high turnover and a disgruntled atmosphere meant that, even if you are a positive person, you're going to struggle against the current of overworked, angry folks."
bad,"Once considered one of the best call centres in Saint John, Xerox Canada is having trouble keeping employees.  Since 2017 it was forced for ""business reasons"" to split into other companies, one of which is based out of India, where ultimately there is no secret where those jobs are going.  The migration of the employees forced to move is being enjoyed by other call centres in the city.  This is affecting morale and if you are going to spend 8 hours a day here, it will affect you as well."
bad,"I worked with WDS A Xerox Company as Senior Technical Support. No Job Work/ Life Balance. Career opportunity was zero and pay rise very bad. They don't see you as a human, only a number."
bad,the management does not care that you dont have a life. no respect for you as a person. the trainer is awesome. the co workers are not friendly at all.
bad,I have worked for this company for 13 years with only 2 raises since I began working here.  A promotion only means more work no more pay.  I was passed over many time by people that i had to train.
bad,It was too long ago for me to remember every thing about working at Xerox. I do remember it being a busy call center and they did try to make it a fun experience specially when dealing with anger customers.
bad,No just fake stock price inflation. Every one is looking for new work. Layoff or outsourced to India is probably coming for most it not all roles. Sad turn for a great company.
bad,Xerox is a company trying to re-discover itself. Too much management turnover. Many employees have either left the company or have been WFR. Sales resources are almost non-existent.
bad,"Xerox Agency business is a meat grinder, street pounder position. "
bad,"I worked for Xerox for over 2 years, and in that time people come and go as it is a call center,. However you were switched at will for contract work ."
bad,The company is on a downward spiral and there are at least 2 lay off per year. Not a place where one can look for longevity. This affects morale and employees feel insecure.
bad,high stress low reward you dont get the tools to succeed at least when i worked there sales even in technical support . good pay though meh meh meh meh
bad,"Xerox was a great place to work for when I first started, but not anymore.  For the last 10 years, lots of layoffs.  Work life balance was bad, had to work overtime constantly."
bad,"I got to work with the cutting edge technology. Learning the modules and tools was interesting and exciting. "
bad,"Açık ofis avantajları"
bad,Printjobs always the same because of just one big customer. No creative work. Management does not except proposal for workplace improvement. People coming and going.
bad,"Learned a lot over the years, but that is over. They no longer value employees. Pay is not linked to performance. Raises do not cover cost of living increases. Cutting costs is more important than increasing revenue."
bad,"So much potential, but its a fortune 500 with so many rules ans laws. The stress of worrying about the job and the pressure from the people above you literal was killing me."
bad,This company outsourced itself into oblivion. Not a good place to work unless you're middle management with no prospects of going anywhere. Every other job is low pay and will eventually be sent to a 3rd world country.
bad,You come in sit down and take phone calls same thing every single day consistent job with consistent pay. Very few hiccups in your day it was the same thing over and over so you get very good at what you do but you can get very bored of doing the same thing all day long.
bad,"Field people are great, both internal and 3rd party companies. Culture changed for many years depending on position you may experience constant changes."
bad,"There used to be a lot of talented people here, a lot of great, challenging and rewarding work and the leadership to capitalize on those things. Over the last 15 years, the company has been so poorly managed at every level, that those who could leave, did, and the engineering is merely a shell of what it once was. It's only a matter of time before the doors shut for good. A prime example of incompetence, coupled with greed and arrogance."
bad,"Xerox has terrible management, promotions are not based on merit or performance but simply for whoever is friends with the managers and does their job well enough to avoid being fired. You did not accrue PTO until 6 months employment, and even then it was only at the 6 month mark that you could use those hours. Innovative programs were put in place and senior management shut them down due to spending too much time developing Trainers and Managers instead of taking phone calls (which were easily being handled). It was a great job for someone breaking into the call center industry to learn the ropes and the lifestyle -- once you tried to gain some sort of career opportunities you were set aside to waste your urge for knowledge."
bad,"For the most part it was a call center and operated as such. A lot of turn over. That turn over was not limited to phone based team members. Management levels were also constantly change making it difficult to have consistency. Their pay scales and structures were constantly complained about by team members. Management inconsistency mean moving up was a struggle, and often felt as if you were being pushed out for the next Managers preferred choice rather than working with those who were already in place."
bad,There is nothing to say. I worked for a Xerox dealership for a year and worked on a 1000 draw a month. Not a good job but got the sales experience need to be where I am now.
bad,"management is racist, the pay is a joke and you do more than your pay taking spanish calls on the regular and they pay bi-linguals a 1.00 more. Disorganized company, management shows favortism"
bad,"there was very little help from supervisors or management."
bad,"A typical manager is overworked and does not show up to meetings. Instead of promotions, they let people go and put more employees on managers who are already to busy to meet with their staff. You have to be there 20 years to move up or come in as a new person. Once you get hired at an amount, it is VERY difficult to get a raise or advance."
bad,These people don't care about people who have children who are disabled. They will work you into an early grave anyway. There is mandatory overtime and many of the people you end up working with are young and act like they are still in high school. Employees bully others and act like children and management says nothing when they witness these events. Someone has to complain for anything to be done about the high school drama that happens here. Everyone is overworked and almost everyone who worked there hated the job.
bad,"Working in a call center is no joke BUT working here was a bit much. Though, I have to say I have almost worked in 2 call center and the division I was working at here - their computers were averagely fast not really slow considering all the programs that were held in one computer. Also the training was very good - this including the training and trainers. very knowledgable and hardworking."
bad,"The people at Xerox are good to work with. However, Xerox far underpay their staff compared to the market average. Fairly often I have seen people up skill themselves and move to different businesses because Xerox aren't willing to up their salary to keep them. There's very little training available at Xerox and many leavers work tends to be shared out amongst already overworked staff members. As a result of the above, its very hard to find people skilled enough to sort problems out. There's far too much in-fighting between Xerox areas, which halts progression of work."
bad,"When I first started working for Xerox, under the Xbox project it was amazing. The class I was in were all great people. From management to lowest on the totem poll. Then people started getting fired for unknown reasons. A new management team came in from CA and just ruined the place. Everyone hated their job with them their. Everyone of them were full of themselves and could do no wrong. I left after about a month of them arriving. They just sucked the life and care out of the once fun and exciting job."
bad,"8-5 dealing with upset customers, running from business to business trying to repair issues with increasingly cheaply made xerox copiers and printers.  overwatch has increased tenfold as management continues to rely on matrix models, GPS and emails designed to crush morale."
bad,"If you need employment, they are always hiring.  Its a great place to learn something new.  Everyone can learn something from this employer.  Be open, do your work, keep great quality and you will be fine.  If you agree to the job, don't complain about the pay."
bad,"Xerox/Conduient was known for their continual pushing of employees, even when praising an employee they would always follow up with how they could do better. They made decisions in contrast to what the State management was asking of us, which always left employees in a no win situation."
bad,The company lacks transparency and it didn't demonstrate its ability nor make any effort to keep the employees stay. It lacks career advancement and growth.
bad,"Over past 10 years or more, senior management does not care about the employee at all.  All about the bottom line and company is still failing.  Most employees are unhappy and are waiting for the notice that their job has been eliminated"
bad,"It's been several years now since we were told that our jobs were going away. It doesn't provide for a very good work environment sitting around waiting for your turn to go. Benefit costs went up and coverage and quality went down. No raise, not even cost of living was given to employees for nearly 7 years."
bad,Xerox was a better company when it cared about its employees instead of the bottom line. The company used to be team oriented but now it is about numbers.
bad,"I was laid off after 18 years like many other of my co-workers. Xerox has become a culture of quick wins, and poor foresight. "
bad,"Xerox is not the same company it was when I started almost twenty years ago. The last ten years seems like the company has tried many things to stay relevant, but they are moving off shore and don't understand the damage that is being done to the customer base."
bad,Upper management could never give a straight answer regarding the future of the company.  It is no surprise that they shipped our jobs to the Phillipines.
bad,The printing industry is getting smaller and Xerox needs to diversify their exposure to the printing industry.  They have spent the last several years getting smaller and seem happy with declining results.
bad,"the job was very stressful, not much money to be made, I worked there for several years and had a new manager every year.  you never new what changes were coming.  the CEO was terrible.  she ran this great brand in the ground."
bad,I have nothing good to say about the current state of the company.  My direct manager is remarkable.  She is the reason that I stayed as long as I did when my intention was to resign long ago.
bad,I had a very hard time being comfortable and feeling like I could ask for help while working here. While in training we would come in and sit down and then the instructor would come in and would show some slide shows and we would do some practice on the computer and then take a test.
bad,"under heavy call flow, managers micro manage employees throughout the day. Have to reach and maintain quality monitoring to continue employment. Must use all tools provided to complete calls."
bad,I recommend this job as a seasonal job. Supervisors really dont care about you and not very helpful. Not a friendly environment to work at. Everybody cares about themselves. And very strict on phones to where they have to be off. If they hear it you will be escorted off the premises.
bad,"The company was fantastic when I first started. It is now plagued by a culture of fraudulent dealings, an inability to keep up with current trends. The unfortunate incompetence of the upper management over the last 5 years has led to the company losing money, then lying to shareholders about up to $500 million in losses."
bad,"Training is extensive, but it is paid.  Customers were rude and extremely unpolite. Supervisors did not take calls like your told in training. on the bright side, you get short lunches and cursed at almost daily. but you can listen to music while you work and your allowed to bring a drink. NO UNIFORM"
bad,Xerox is losing revenue and market share in a ever shrinking market place. Five years ago we had 10 managers and 150 associates. Now after my last day they will be down to three managers and 50 associates. All those jobs were sent overseas and that is just my facility.
bad,"Mala, lamentablemente falta estabilidad comercial para con el personal de venta ya que no los instruyen y tampoco se hace un curso de ventas o capacitación al entrante vendedor, ademas del control de los horarios permanentes por parte de la administración."
bad,"The pay was good, but when hired as full time permanent employee in January and got laid off in May, just because the client did not sign back the contract, don't how and what kind of people you hire and spend so much time and effort and money is a waste of time l think"
bad,Answering calls all day. I learned how to deal with upset public. when there are not many calls they allow you to that the rest of the day off without pay.
bad,Management provides answers and immediately makes changes that are different from the answers they provide. Information is usually inaccurate due to constant changes in the office.
bad,great job to start off. I wouldn't recommend making a living off of this type of job. Just a good job to start off as. Make sure to always stay to yourself.
bad,"Xerox is tying to reinvent itself with new offerings in service and software. Not a strong suit for them as a copier company. Enjoyed meeting with clients, not fun being micro managed because of corporate shortcomings."
bad,There are huge political interest within management which result to unfair environment for staff who excel and productive. The situation sometimes gets heat up when mid-level management try to lick their bosses.
bad,Operating seven different systems at a time taught me how to multitask. Every day you'd come in and pull each one of your systems up to make sure they were all functioning correctly.
bad,"Having worked at two separate sites, one being much busier I will deduce the common denominators. "
bad,"I enjoyed the work, when I was hired they asked that you have some medical experience. The problem with the job, they just hired anyone. The management team sucked, what I enjoyed the most was helping clients get their medications. You can't have a productive work place if everyone in there was related or a friend. It really became a zoo."
bad,"Basically come in every day and just sit down at a computer for 8+ hours. Learned nothing useful, management is okay now. Used to be awful. Very easy job, but extremity boring. Hardest part of the job is dealing with management that is not in office."
bad,"If you are unable to support someone due to their equipment being out of warranty, and no path forward, or they have a device no longer supported, the negative outlook they give in the call summary can get people demoted, hours cut or even put in alternative training. Their management is given 15 mins training and expected to know how to manage people. "
bad,"started out with logging into computer work desk. High call volume analyzing and trouble shooting customer issues on iOS and Mac OS products. It is a great learning experience for someone wanting to learn a particular product and gives general insight to how a computer system works. As far as growth is concerned, one might have to invest several years to make a management position, an actual manager positon. For a tech service company, there really isn't any room for growth with respect to different avenues of the IT field. Ex. networking, VPN, Programming, Project management..."
bad,"A once great company brought low by short-sightedness, lack of vision and inability to create foundations upon which great things can be built."
bad,"Normal day in call center: log onto phones, computer systems, using older programs with grey screens. Get calls from people they will get directed to the county office. Management is not the best. The pay is base on per call, per grade for two weeks ..Have to have good quality and quantity."
bad,"Not a bad place to work, but with hardly any management, there is not much floor support on Production floor. Can be very stressful some days. its interesting working for a phone company!"
bad,I was part of the pilot team and stayed up to almost 5 years under the same account. The number of countries that we were supporting kept on growing but the management seems to have difficulty in adding the ideal amount of workforce so we can work more effectively and efficiently.
bad,Try to utilize the talent within the system and need to focus not only business point and savings.... Since employee are the backbone  its your responsibility to keep them satisfied atleast to 80% for the survival of brand in the market
bad,"I have been with Xerox for almost 4 years now and a typical day for me is to walk the call center floor and make sure the employees(agents) have all system access they need, coach them to calls that are graded by me and QA, also teach them the new policies and procedures as they pertain to their job and the call handling.  I have learned as much as I possibly can about Medicare and how Medicare insurance works. Also I have learned to be more of a people person during my tenure.  My co-workers are very spunky and spontaneous and we make the most out of our days.  The hardest part of my job is working as hard as I do and knowing so much information but also not being paid a fair salary for my knowledge and efforts.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to make the agents happy.  I love to help them work through a very tedious and trying call or situation and know that we worked and got the best outcome."
bad,"There are a lot of people that I worked with over the years at Xerox that were great.  Unfortunately, almost all of them have been RIF'd.  Whenever Xerox needs to ""make their numbers"" the primary course of action is to RIF people across all levels, regardless of expertise, knowledge, success, etc..."
bad,"No job security, no hikes, only good things is work-life balance.  Management is not good. No standard HR policies. There are mor cons than pros."
bad,"This job started off okay, 12 weeks of paid training. Trainers are nice, easy to get along with and very supportive. Once your done with training, the moral is very poor. They have incentives but it means nothing when your supervisor doesn't help you get to that next step. They are not flexible when it comes to your needs or personal issues."
bad,"The people I worked with actually made the job, but the schedule and the people over us in management and HR weren't the best"
bad,"Lack of management, Management goals change constantly.  No advancement opportunities.  Lack of sales force team in area.  Enjoyed working with customers and co-workers."
bad,"I had an Great Supervisor, but job is not consistent things change by the day  ; learned great skills far as pharmacy and medical claims ..job can open other dorrs but is not a job I would make an career out of"
bad,"There is no room for advancement, favoritism, no raises, no incentives. There is no stability. Benefits arent that great, for the cost."
bad,"Although an old institution, this is a company in transition which has more room to grow and needs organizational maturity.  Culture is not engaging and turnover is extremely high.  Lots of room for improvement in all aspects."
bad,"A typical day at work would start off as us getting strait to the phones as soon as we clocked in. We would answer calls and provide technical support. If we needed to escalate the call to a higher level, lots of times they would be unsupportive and bash us for doing so."
bad,"If you are a high school graduate looking for your first job this is a good job for you. It has decent benefits and the pay is one dollar above Taco Bell. However, management is very unprofessional. It is extremely hard to promote. Its almost like being in high school again. The job demands are great and it can be frustrating being so worked with so little pay. No holidays off. I even had to work Christmas day without holiday pay. With over 500 employees one is easily recycled until the next individual comes along. Good for a first job, but definitely not a career."
bad,over all this could be a great place to work there months where there is unlimited overtime so this could be alot of money that could be made
bad,Unorganized management . Training was good due to the trainers from the Orlando site. This is not a business professional atmosphere.
bad,"The salaries are not compatible to what we do. They hire you as a Facilitator Manager, but in the system you are a Supervisor, and that is what your pay is based off."
bad,"Xerox started out seeming like a great place to work, then quickly went down hill. The job is very stressful with very little help for relief."
bad,Alamo is a very intense project. Daily changes for this project which is still very new. There many different programs within this project.
bad,Then hcsc with xerox is your job to be apart of. Typical day consisted of logging into the system and start keying your work. Nothing ever changed. I was promised I could make up to $14.00 but never made it past $9.00. My manager was great and was really flexible with letting you go home early if needed or giving you certain days off. But towards the end of my job there they weren't letting us go home until we were told to leave. Working 11-12 hour shifts. Lots of turn over rate.
bad,"Working for a call center for Xerox is not a good experience. The job is not stable, and they are constantly changing your job description without notice. You're treated like cattle, not actual people. They invest zero money into their call centers and their people."
bad,The company needs much improvement. The company is very unorganized and unprofessional. They rush training to get people on the production floor to take calls.
bad,Xerox is a large company that out sources a lot of their jobs.  I do not like this about them.  Pay increases were very few and very low. No room to advance with in the company.  Favoritism was used to promote within.
bad,"It was a call center. I answered customer problems with tech support. I was a customer service rep."
bad,"This is a wonderful opportunity to work from home. However, all times are in central standard time. Even though a shift is from 7 AM to 4 PM, this is central time. I would prefer working eastern time, so that this allows for scheduling family time. The training was 4 weeks and we were not given all of the training needed to perform our jobs. Longer training time or more access to the programs we were going to be using would have been wonderful!"
bad,"Poor job security.  Overtime one minute, laid off the next.  Employees are not valued and there is very little opportunity for advancement or reward for hard work."
bad,"The competitive environment is understandable, but in a job where you get yelled at by customers for 12 hours a day you don't want to add the pressure of competing with your coworkers for bonuses. It's really no wonder their turnover rate is so high."
bad,"The Company provides good work experience and opportunity for growth.  However, the lack of consideration of the employees needs and comforts are largely inconsistent."
bad,"Very unorganized, lectures during training with no one-on-one- focus. I have heard they have turned into another service but this was my experienced while working there."
bad,This particular site used to be ACS and not much changed after Xerox took over. They are implementing new management to try and upgrade the facility and incorporate it into the professional Xerox brand that everyone knows.
bad,Very uncertain about fun. no future advancements seem or offered what I know. Who work hard they show no respect. Reduction of work force with no reason or warning. Even there is other positions in other departments they would not offer or support to transfer employee.
bad,the job isn't that hard the management and other associates are nice. The hardest thing is to keep the numbers up. they are mostly based on how the customer feels about Verizon.
bad,Great work/life balance. No organization. Really dysfunctional. Lack of communication. Compensation and benefits are low. Advancement is difficult.
bad,"Counter productive bonus structure, set up to minimize earnings."
bad,"I can just say that working fast food is not easy for the pay that you get. I have worked days shifts,evening shifts, and graveyard shifts as well. The hardest part of the job was trying to satisfy customers needs and working at a busy location."
bad,This place is very stressful and he worst place to have a job if i didnt need  job i wouldnt ever be there. They care nothing about the coworkers. We do so much for our customers.
bad,"The work days go by really fast, strict time constraints for breaks, learn to be self sufficient because of lack of support through management, management fails to give coaching for job improvement and does not communicate well. The hardest part of the job is sitting at a desk all day but the most enjoyable part of the job was assisting and getting to know the customers."
bad,Busy atmosphere. Back to back calls. No time to adjust for next call. Leadership is mediocre at best. More professionalism needed in the facility. Most Co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of this job was to adjust between calls in the beginning . Literally only seconds between each call.
bad,"Overall it was constant change that you wold not be aware of until you come into work, low pay with no raise incentive, schedule changes daily, somewhat unorganized ans unprofessional at times."
bad,"Moral is very low. This company does NOT value their employees.  For what they ask of their employees they should pay more money. And their employee benefits are horrible. They only want to pay you one salary but want you to learn three different disciplines (Health and Welfare, Payroll or Pension)"
bad,"At Xerox I didn't feel so comfortable there, everyone was rude and mean and wasn't so find. Im the type of person that takes my job seriously, but playful and happy at the same time. Management was okay, hardest part of my job, was nothing and enjoyable part nothing"
bad,Layoffs are a constant concern. Mis-managed from the top down. Work/Life balance is good but the concern of layoffs looms each and every day. Pay is low compared to industry.
bad,"Xerox in Moosic, PA is honsestly one of the most unfair, biased places I have ever worked.  After almost 2 years of working there, i was fired over the phone for something I didn't say.  I was advocating for the customer like they told us to do but I was accused of saying something totally different.  I have also been trying to move up and it seemed like if you were besties with a supervisor or manager, it didnt matter about your numbers, you were in.  There was a guy who just got done with ""sucess bay"" which is to help the people on the floor who are having major problems with their calls.  Well, this guy a week after being done with sucess bay, became a trainer.   A TRAINER.  and totally failed at it.  but there was a TON more tenured agents who would have loved to have that position.  but because this guy was good friends with the manager, he was a trainer.   thats just one example but there are plenty more.  i wouldnt suggest this job to anyone."
bad,A good starter job if you are looking for entry level positions. It will help you when looking for professional advancement due to the experience you will gain with this company.
bad,"Il lavoro è interessante e ti permette una buona autonomia e possibilità di migliorare se ne hai voglia."
bad,"As far as the employees loved them. But upper management rude, disrespectful, talk about other people's business on the floor, lack of resources and catch a attitude when you ask them a question and many are unqualified to be in positions, they show a lot of favoritism. They even made it mandatory that we had to email or send a message to them which they never responded to if we had a question to ask. Sometimes we will wait 30-40 minutes and still did not get a answer. I worked in many places and some great and others were not so great. But when I got here I never seen a disorganized company in my life. If anyone is applying here one word: RUN.........."
bad,After working here for 1.5 years they have 2 big managers fired.  There is no culture at Xerox.  There is no professionalism is this company.  The most enjoyable part about this job resolving the customers needs. The hardest part of this job was coming to work and facing the supervisors who showed no professionalism.
bad,"I learnt a lot working here, I made new friends and tested if my communication skills were accepted."
bad,"I have worked in many call centers but Xerox, by far is the worst when it comes to overall performance of employees. Mangers are never around to offer assistance, or feedback on work being done. I can honestly say Xerox was just a paycheck for me, and thats saying alot when normally i love to go to work.  There was nothing enjoyable about working in this call center, minus one or two co-workers standing by what they felt was right and wrong in the work area."
bad,wasn't bad but the management at xerox is down right awful. no way to schedule time off without going through a ridiculous computer system. All the agents are highly undervalued. Not enough money to justify working there
bad,"Very disorganized.  Not a good place to work."
bad,"Based on the fact that this company is big on offshoring and outsourcing work they do not have any compassion or regard for US based employees.  Management is into securing their own jobs and not concerned with their staff - and each time someone is laid off the workload goes to another team member despite their current workload.  I am trying to find something kind to say but it is difficult - I loved my co-workers but towards the end of my position the company morale was so down.  "
bad,"Job wasn't hard, just had to get used to explaining different health benefits available for there specific situation. Management could have given more tools to do research but overall I liked my coworkers & management so it made it easy to come to work."
bad,"I answered about 160 calls per day, assisting customers with billing issues, phone orders, technical issues and answered questions on new devices. The hardest part of the job was listening to customers scream about their bill because of a salesman at the store giving wrong info and there isn't anything you can do about it. The best part of the job was  helping people and keeping the customers satisfied in any way I could as long as it was within the companies guidelines. ( ex: credits, free downloads, extra minutes, free data for a month, etc.)"
bad,"Xerox Business Services (01.11.2011 to 30.05.2014)"
bad,"This place has such great potential but has a revolving door of employees. Hardly anyone stays. The training used to be provided in  a formal manner, classroom, time spent learning the job requirements and duties- now, it's all on the fly and no one seems to care enough to provide the time it takes. The pay is great, type of call center duties great, coworkers full of their own drama and mgt complacent and could not care less. I got sick of it and quit, finding better"
bad,Fast pace work enviroment. Family enviroment. There is really no hard part to the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you work alone at your own pace.
bad,"Like any other big company, if you manage your career and find the right mentors, there is no limit to how high you can rise."
bad,"Had to quit job, due to immediate schedule change. Had no warning, or time to plan for changes. And, no option. Either quit, or begin new schedule right away. Therefore, had no time to arrange new schedule for daycare for my daughter."
bad,"It would be a typical call center job, go in answer phones and assist people with problems or questions. Biggest grief was management was unresponsive. When needed they would try to dodge you."
bad,"Xerox was an okay place to work at when I first started. Good environment, positive attitudes, close friends. However, after a year of working there, no recognition was given to the employees for all the hard work they do. Friends you make quit the job so you end up being alienated quickly. I went through five supervisors so I was unable to build a proper relationship with my seniors, and above all else, if you do so much as breathe at the customer incorrectly, they will give you a bad survey and make your daily life so much more difficult to handle. It's a good job to start at to build your resume, but definitely not a place to stay."
bad,This is not a place that you want to make a career. Most of what you do is the same thing over and over. This company does not like to reward hard work and has not provided and raises. Like I said it is a job. Learn what you can and get out.
bad,"I liked the job at first but once I got used to how things operate, I should of known management is corrupt and full of political games They allow a former employee to sign on with their client for an obvious conflict of interest, then that person systematically is dooming the contract. They do not stand behind their employees and make the job near impossible to accomplish according to their standards.The management structure is completely clueless on how to run things and they wonder why the get fined 100k per month for failing SLA, then they fire techs at will.They let a tech steal computers for over 6 months, just to show how clueless they really are. A good company knows where every computer is at all times. They make a ""executive support"" tech a acting supervisor for months and make him go through the stresses of being a supervisor then don't even give him the position, but give it to some clown that had to be removed from one property."
bad,"I have worked in the call center environment for over fifteen years. This was by far my worst experience in one. My position was ""project based"" which was great because it allowed me to see if this was somewhere I would want to work permanently.... NOT . The only good thing I can say is that we had an awesome trainer named Kim."
bad,I enjoy working for Xerox in regards to my coworkers and my schedule.
bad,"Xerox es una empresa muy completa, sus instalaciones están bien equipadas y en general uno dispone de todo lo necesario para entregar un buen servicio y cumplir el trabajo plenamente"
bad,Used to be a great place to work. Good compensation and vacation and paid sick days. Now It's all downhill. They try to turn you into robots and eff with your pay. Too many rules now in place. How about just hiring more classy people in the first place? Place has gotten really ghetto really fast.
bad,"Getting a job at xerox was a decision i made to try and expand my resume. Knowing full well that there was advancement potential, but not realizing how pseudo-professional they really are."
bad,"This is an inbound call center, therefore is a very busy work place where I'm on the phone  receiving  calls all day. My supervisor is one of the best supervisor I have ever had."
bad,"Poor benefits, poor environment, smart co-workers.  Overall company health is questionable with little to no job security."
bad,"Was able to improve skills in de-escalating upset clients and confirm theories learned in college of how management should and should not treat employees. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with account problems that were a result of known company system delays and bugs, which management never notified employees about. Deadlines for resolutions to system issues were rarely met, this often caused already disgruntled customers to get even more upset. Lack of positive incentive and follow through on goals from management cause massive numbers of employees to quit. The most enjoyable part of the job was the self satisfaction of being able to help customers and fix account issues that have been unresolved for months. Because I was a Subject Matter Expert outstanding issues were often escalated to my level for resolution. "
bad,"I enjoyed my 23 year tenure while being employed with Xerox prior to being laid off on 05-31-2013.  Always a fun place to work.  My fellow workers and my customers were key to my success."
bad,Good place to work if you don't associate with anyone other than your job function 
bad,"It’s amazing the diversity in a company like Xerox, Working with a diverse amount people is an experience to remember. Teamwork is the key term when it comes to my co-workers. I enjoyed working with the amazing amount of people, there are anywhere from 140 to 360 people at one time working for Rightsource RX, the camaraderie with myself and my co-workers at Xerox was an amazing experience. I would have to say that when time got rough we pulled together and worked hard to solve issues. I must also say that we worked well together; we were defiantly a great team."
bad,"Pra mim foi bom por ser meu primeiro emprego,aprendi muita coisa,inclusive a me relacionar com o publico."
bad,"Working at Xerox is/was strange. The job was advertised as a temporary job, but it turns out that wasn't quite the case. At first, you go in and you open mail all day long. Not really a big deal besides paper cuts and the like, but you can get over that. Then you are taught to sort mail. Once that happens, it seems as though all hell breaks loose. The co-workers at my particular facility were keeping a heavily trained eye on the trainees, waiting until we could sort somewhat decently before they decided to full out try and get over on us by giving us the harder work, lying about how much work was left, complaining to management because trainees left earlier, and making snide remarks constantly. You see, Xerox works on a system called ABC pay. You get whatever pay is consummate with your speed. If you are going too slow, they can drop your hourly rate to minimum wage (or here, that is 7.25 an hour). Training for us started at 8.00 an hour, obviously not the best pay in the world, but the recruiter made it sound like it was going to be cake getting better pay. WRONG. At the speed myself and other trainees had topped out at, we were still going too slow and would ""never make it to production"" with the speed we were going, which meant if we somehow did, minimum wage was in our future. Please tell me how you can take a step back on the pay scale with formal training??? They gushed about how a top performer of theirs was making over 50 an hour. That's great until you realize if you're going that fast, you aren't getting that many hours because there won't be anymore work. Other things"
bad,"Horrible sick days, had to quit due to having no voice for about a week but was only allowed 2 days off."
bad,there's not much good training before they put you on the phone. many people will call in with problems that you cannot solve and then get mad at you.
bad,"Good job but bad management. Xerox offered competitive pay and good benefits. They had raises every six months with opportunities for advancement, but there was too much favoratism and politics."
bad,Its not the company it used to be.  Now the annual (or more) layoffs of large % of the IT population are taking its toll on the productivity and the environment.  May be a great place for a temporary job - but don't plan on it long term.
bad,Company is in the midst of significant downsizing and offshoring.  There is no job security.  The benefits are horrible. The people I work with are great and you have the option to work from home if you need to.
bad,Xerox was very good to me in the beginning of my career however when I got older and made more money I felt my job security diminished as was always looking over my shoulder
bad,"Was hired, trained and the sent home after working less than an hour every day. After about 6 months of that I was told my position was being done away with and I was laid off. This job was a joke"
bad,They are only about the numbers being done. They care nothing of the quality of work.  negative atmosphere. leaders are not trained to lead. They offer no training.
bad,"Management are lenient. Easy parking and access to office building. "
bad,"My typical day includes working in Oracle, Xelus, Outlook, Excel, Word and other applications."
bad,"Often had to work weekends or long nights with no warning due to a need for a new classroom or a new production floor.  Raises were non existent due to IT being a ""non-revenue generating group"".  Management on site was great and the people I worked with were great to work with."
bad,"If you don't have any customer service experience and you're seeking an opportunity this is the job for you. If you have another choice, run away as far as you can from this place."
bad,"The only issue I had with xerox was it was a temp job. I loved the courier and print position , but I could not afford the rate of pay and the lack of benefits anymore so towards the end of my contract I began searching"
bad,The hardest part of working for this employer. It was very micromanaged. If you did not meet the quota for the calls in a average day you were written up.
bad,"This job is boring for the most part a lot of sitting answering phOnes. It was great money but not worth the stress if you know noth Mf about iPhones, macs, or iPods this isn’t for you a lot of researching and troubleshooting . Customers just yell and be angry which makes representative frustrated."
bad,Would never work there again. Much happier at HR Directions where my disability was addressed and within three days was accomadated. Nothing more to say.
bad,The company was consistently acquired by new affiliates. Employees were not given complete information on acquisitions and keft to pursue new careers in fear of losing their job with little to no notice
bad,"Xerox was a tough place to work.  Was on call 24  a day 365 days a year. Once manager of 10 years left, the management chain was non existent. HR and Payroll were handled remotely out of Dallas.  Very hard to get any kind of answers from either group."
bad,"The metrics here are nearly impossible. You are dealing with angry customers and trying to get them to keep their accounts, but you are also required to sell them things which often upsets the customers even more."
bad,"This review is about Xerox services - which is now known as Conduent. The company suffers from micromanagement and near zero career advancement opportunities. Some people get stressed out due to too much work and by not knowing the direction in which the company is going, and quit. People I know started as software developers/Business Analysts and have not seen a salary increase for 6-10 years."
bad,not learning  enough. too much politics and gossip. was the only male working in my department. so of course lots of gossip. but i was treated well. can 't complain.
bad,"Xerox Corporation separated into two companies in January of 2017.  Since that time, there has been extensive restructuring, downsizing, along with aggressive cost savings efforts."
bad,"If you are looking for something temporary, this would be a great job for you. Otherwise keep looking for a permanent position, this is a contracted position. If you have kids, this job will definitely take spending time with them away, especially if you are willing to make the money that they are providing. When it's crunch time, look for them to take away your breaks. We were refused lunch breaks, they preferred us to eat at the desk while speaking with the customers. So, if this is the job for you then apply. If not keep looking. No benefits at all, very hard to be added on as permanent employee."
bad,"The company seems to be downsizing and they make it very difficult to remain employed there. A lot of older more experienced employees have been phased out. "
bad,Very poor environment for a customer service call center. Management says advancement is based on numbers bet yet they play favorites and many people with great numbers are held back if they aren't favored. An average day is 40-50 calls dealing with frustrated people which is the hardest part of the position. It is extremely fun to talk to people throughout the country though.
bad,"Income is performance based, however customer feedback can decrease pay regardless of how well you perform your job. Managers provide great feedback for improving performance. Unfortunately employees switch teams frequently making camaraderie difficult to maintain."
bad,"Site leader was horrible, she did not care about her employees, talked down to supervisor. She was the reason for our low productions and attrition. She did not care about our business."
bad,Upper management does not  know how to manager. Some employees are over worked while other do not have enough work . There is no accountability.  There is no systematic process for managing project.
bad,"Xerox is a total bummer to work for.  They are incredibly inefficient.  The waste is hard to watch.  Still, they make money and report it so proudly to employees who are living in fear of losing their jobs and never get raises.  Immediate supervisors were always great to work with and apologetic about how bad the company is failing."
bad,"Unpredictable, poor management, lack of clarity on advancement, no continuing education, poor leadership, petty co-workers, poorly managed travel program..."
bad,"Xerox is very easy to get started at, I walked in the building and within 2 hours I had a job. The first 4 weeks will be paid training which they compensate surprisingly well for. Once you hit the actual work floor its all down from there. The customer are very rude most of the time and there is really no way to defend yourself against them because if they give you a bad survey you lose your bonus or worse your fired. if you can block out negative people and constant personal degradation then you should be fine. This base pay is pretty standard but if your a hustler and can sale pretty much anything than there are opportunities to make close to 3k in one pay check before taxes. Xerox is a wolf pit of scheming co workers, Ghetto supervisors, and lax upper management. Keep your head low, don't mingle to much , Do your work and you should be ok."
bad,"The culture is to bring in as many people as possible and select only a few for long term employment.  The culture is represented by their audacious turnover rate.  They do mass hirings and fire just as quickly. This is an ok experience for first time employees, so they can learn what is not ok in a work environment.  Just barely a step above fast food."
bad,"-80-120 calls per day"
bad,"- Dar suporte técnico aos clientes da marca"
bad,C'est une bonne société pour son histoire et sa politique tant est si vous tombez sur la bonne équipe et le bon manager....
bad,Not a great fit. Sorry to say but went through training and my training class had to make a group complaint on a trainer because he was so bad. Also floor lead person was exact same personality of talking in a condescending tone. Was very uncomfortable.
bad,At Xerox you put in very long hours with very little to none breaks in between. The culture reminded me of  high school and if you didn't grow up in the area you were cast out. I did not enjoy this job. Management was ok. I had to managers that were awesome they worked with you and tried to make your days not feel as long. At the time I was a college student trying to keep my everyday necessities up. Overall I would not go back here.
bad,"Although Xerox was once known as a hallmark company to work for, my experience is that leadership had one play in their playbook -- cut costs through RIF and offshoring. Xerox is a huge company and I must concede that it would be a difficult company to lead with all of the beauracracy	that must be faced. Additionally, there is not a simple strategic vision for the company so ""what do I want to be when I grow up"" has not been succinctly answered. "
bad,Company itself had very good pay and overtime when available for full time shifts.  Unfortunately the work environment was childish and management often engaged in workers personal lives.  Were unhelpful as well as rude.
bad,This BPO part of the business is crazy and not well organized.It is an absolute disaster. Every aspect of the company is poorly run... maybe after the full transition to Conduent things will be better.
bad,"No additional Comments"
bad,"The only reason I worked for this company is because nothing else needing little experience paid as much. The benefits are laughable, but the hourly pay is good when you can't really find anything else."
bad,"Could be productive at time. More work required than compensation. Direct manager was effective. Not enough emphasis placed on quality of work, more emphasis on quantity which made for poor service levels"
bad,"I would rather sell *ss then to work at Xerox and I have no desire to sell *ss. It may be extreme, but it's so disappointing when they expect so much from their employees and in return give so little."
bad,Not a lot of advancement opportunities or pay increases. They do however support your work-life balance. Schedule flexibility is a huge pro with the company. Great for students.
bad,Xerox is an ok place to work for experience. If you would like to move up i suggest finding a position elsewhere. The pros to the job was having weekends off. Cons- I feel the company doesn't care about the employees. You never know if the contract is good to go each year. Your always looking for employment because there is no definate job security at xerox.
bad,"Great company overall. Local level of management needs ongoing management training, Learning to choose quality, educated and career driven persons, would advance company."
bad,"toen ik hier begon werd gezegd dat je of 2 avonden pw moest werken of de zaterdag. ik heb iedere week 2 avonden en de zaterdag gewerkt, en toen ik vroeg om dit te wijzigen kon dat niet want de planning werd in Bulgarije gemaakt. ja, maar u wilt dat ik mij aan mijn afspraken houd, wilt u zich dan aan de uwe houden svp? dat was een beetje éénrichtingsverkeer. de collega's, de werksfeer en de training en begeleiding op de werkvloer waren top, overleg en inspraak iets minder.  het moeilijkst waren de systemen en procedures waarmee gewerkt werd, die liepen regelmatig tijdens je gesprekken muurvast, het leukste was dat je klanten vaak direct aan de telefoon meteen kon helpen, zij zagen meteen resultaat, zo sloot je veel gesprekken met een positief gevoel af."
bad,I learned the skills needed for a customer service representative and how to apply them to every phone call. Management is unorganized.
bad,Great people but management could use a makeover to further help agents. Hard working agents are pretty much scared away due to not only lack of incentives but also lack of support from management.
bad,"It is not a hard job, just a stressful one. There are a lot of customers that can't even respect you as human that are really trying to help them with their issue. Day after day of that can really break your spirit. And the compensation is a complete joke. There is never a raise and everyone has the opportunity to make the same amount of money no matter how long you've been there."
bad,"limited growth as employee, only use contractors now, takes years to become a full time employee. If you like staring at a laptop all day you might like this"
bad,"I can't really day that I liked this job,  it really didn't take much for me to get a promotion and get off the phones. Went to work everyday and did my job and within 3 months was promoted to Quality Analyst. Even then,  it was tough to enjoy my job. The schedule choices were terrible and requesting a day off was more likely to be denied than anything"
bad,Its like being in high school again. People are constantly gossiping and are just plain rude. I wouldnt recommend working for Xerox but if you need the money then it's not as bad as working in the food industry.
bad,great place. environment not so much. Management not so great. Very have's and have not. I wouldn't recommend this place.
bad,I like my coworkers but you never get raises. We were promised 3 raises so far and got nothing. There's no room for advancement.
bad,"La gerencia de este momento esta buscando dar promociones internas en base a diversidad y equidad de genero, pero literalmente para ellos es que solo mujeres reciben promociones y aumentos, lo cual es bueno, pero ignorando las políticas que ellos mismos imponen."
bad,The work in itself is fine. This job lacks the tools and resources that are needed to do your job effectively. Training was not effective.
bad,"The job is very simple, and relaxing. I learned how to fix problems with machines. The most enjoyable part is being able to work independently, the hardest part is having to stand up and work long hours."
bad,"salaray is ok, they are on minimum wage. no benefits aside from SSS and Philhealth. job security is a so-so since they only have contractual. management never visited us to see if the department is still okay."
bad,"A  typical day at work is very long and mostly stressful. I admit I learned a lot of soft skills while dealing with customers and through training but the job is still not all that great. The management is a bit unorganized to me, there are too many sudden changes almost every week and the changes are mostly not for the best.The job gets harder and harder and there become more and more reasons to terminate employees. My co-workers come and go either they get fed up and find other jobs or they are terminated. I do still enjoy the little time I do get to speak with co-workers during breaks, at lunch and when calls are coming in slow. The hardest part of the job is keeping the supervisors and managers happy and meeting metrics. Satisfying the customer is easy I have no issue with that and I used to think that the most enjoyable part was speaking with customers and hearing about different backgrounds while still being able to assist but the job is not really enjoyable anymore honestly. Overall it's not the worst place to work because it is a great job to start off with for customer service experience and it is also a good job to put on your resume."
bad,"While Xerox has a great name brand, their reputation as a company is fading fast both to the employee and the customer. Inability to evolve with the market has left them spinning wheels years ago."
bad,"It was a great job while it lasted; I learned a lot of different skills, interacted with people from a large variety of backgrounds with different ideas, there were many projects that I was involved with that, due to outside circumstances, fell apart. As I moved into my quality position, I got to see firsthand the back and forth bickering and withholding of information between my employer and our client, which was made all the more stressful because I was the middleman required to help tell 300+ people what changes were happening without being able to give them the full story because I was told to withhold information."
bad,"an ok place to work, no employee loyalty, rampant favoritism, its the type of company that you do good in a who you know not what you know type of environment"
bad,"Zero Training"
bad,learned alot and really appreiciate the opportunity to learn new and great things in the many different postions i held at xerox
bad,"This expansion role is predicated upon the desire to create synergy between US BFSI organization & Canadian sales operations.  I have been building a North American Sales and Delivery model with high opposition from Canadian mid-level management."
bad,The distance was too far from my home and the pay rate was entirely too low. Also the company was just unprepared and no one really knew what to do when it came to answering the customers questions.
bad,The people that work for the clients are good people to service and very patient.  The management of the IT team is very poor as well as the planning on projects.  There is also no real appreciation for employees and work that has been done.
bad,"The job was a horrible call center position. There was really nothing at all that I enjoyed about the job, other than clocking out. The work was mind numbingly boring and the training provided beforehand was almost entirely useless and didn't help at all. The one good thing I can say about the place is that the managers are some of the best coworkers I've ever had the pleasure of meeting."
bad,"Xerox isn't the company it used to be. They are constantly outsourcing and have eliminated the benefits. You don't even get a choice on insurance any more and their wages are far from competitive. Don't bother with this place, I promise, you will regret it."
bad,"Too much bottom line, no chance for advancement, poor employee/management relations. Too many test. Enjoyed working with Sign Center employees."
bad,The job was a call center job and it was a really good job. It was a contract job and I was on contract for a short period of time.
bad,"No matter what they tell you, nothing really prepares you for this job. It may seem like a cozy place during the creative training courses where you subsequently develop close relations with your coworkers only to watch them slip through the cracks of corporate bureaucracy. You quickly learn that in order to retain your job, let alone earn a decent pay, is to up sell your way through actual customer's problems."
bad,Never thought I'd speak ill of the company but the return on investment for working here is very poor. Dissatisfaction with work and the CEO is rampant among the employees. Management is overworked and in some instances sourced out of state or country.
bad,spent the days on the phone with short breaks and management was very disorganized but i enjoyed the interaction with the customers and co-workers
bad,Call center is not organized and they promote employees in higher positions but do not increase their pay. The good thing about working here is that you gain knowledge of systems and how to operate working with health insurance. Speaking with member and providers daily gives you experience that you can take to a better company and advance in a role and get compensated appropriately.
bad,"If you need to pay your bills working here is fine, but if you want job security, room for advancement, and the possibility of yearly salary increases, this is not the place for you."
bad,"Responds to telephone inquiries and complaints using standard scripts and procedures.."
bad,"If you want a relaxed place to work, go for it. If you want to deal with childish managers and being paid nearly half of what you can make literally across the street, it's your place to be."
bad,working consistently on the phone and handling customers complaints was not so much an issue. But the handling of employees and commitment to make the environment worker friendly lacked tremendously.
bad,In this job we have specific standards that we had to meet. Clients were often irate. I learned how to be very patient with people through this job because it is important to not take things personal. Coworkers made the job more enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was not being able to speak up for ourselves as agents when people were being extremely rude.
bad,"With a management team that favors cliches and tenure over ability and non-Xerox experience the sales arm has caps built in, a competing field sales department (2 of them, actually) and a very rigid advancement ladder that means you'd have to work there for at least five years before any meaningful career advancement."
bad,"A typical work day could range between a shift of 8, 10, or 12 hours. I learned Time management and how to be resourceful with the tools that I am given. Management is management, they do what they can  to stay within the company guidelines. My co-workers are very helpful and respectful. The hardest part of the job is trying to find a solution to a problem when there is none. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
bad,When I first started I liked working there. The training was great and I knew what I was doing. I got out on the floor feeling confident. But management and our trainers didnt prepare us for how negative the callers were going to be and how many complaints we were going to deal with all day. I guess I should have expected that going into a customer service center but oh well.
bad,"Salary Increases or Raises haven't been given in 5+ years.  With the recent cost of living increases, taxes being increased, and benefits costing more, this is completely unacceptable."
bad,"Loved my trainer, hate my schedule!"
bad,"It’s a place that shows a lot of potential but management has to be restructured. I was hired on a temporary contract and I managed benefits for some respectable companies. On the first day I knew something as wrong. We (new hires) were given a workbook on benefits, healthcare, and medicare. We were told we had about a week and half to complete it (on our own). Then we were trained by someone who had no business training anyone. The next two weeks were spent getting half trained and lo and behold, we were told to go out on the floor and take phone calls. With what we knew? Really?"
bad,"none. it is a day job. Me personally, I need to be able to grow."
bad,"Cashier mangers did not care about employees, co workers was great to work with"
bad,"I have learned quite a lot since I started with Fuji Xerox especially learning multiple system to resolve accounting issues."
bad,".Typcial day was taking calls, answering questions about billing issues, trouble shooting mobile phones, and updating information into the computer.  Learned a lot about working with people in a different environment and troubleshooting mobile devices.  The hardest part of the job was trying to resolve an issue and not getting a high rating on a survery"
bad,"Early arrival, late to leave. Sales pressure without adequate resources. You don't matter. Very competitive. Lack of support. None."
bad,Not a bad company to work for if you like to work overtime. If you dont then you will be butting heads with them. That is all.
bad,"if you have a change to a better company, I recommend you don't consider this company"
bad,"Just keep on looking these guys aren't worth it.... They DO NOT care about their employees, Pay is terrible I researched it and it is in the bottom 8% nationwide."
bad,"Xerox Services, which is the division I work for, has very large aspirations but does not seem to be able to fully execute.  Communication is key and it is important the same message is heard across every department and division within the company.  My day can be exhilarating and frustrating at the same time.  I work in a smaller office and due to staffing issues (that seem to be never ending) I  float from area to area and assist wherever I am needed.  I am very greatful for the exposure and knolwledge this brings me but frustrated because I am usually falling behind in what I need to get done on a regular basis."
bad,"A typical day includes answering a minimum of 60-70 calls per day resolving difficult financial and online banking issues. I learned to work in a very tense, fast paced environment and developed exceptional communication skills. The overall quality of management was poor. Co-workers at Xerox created violence in the workplace EX: fist fighting on production floor as well as parking lots, theft, and bullying. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the violence in the work place and the poor management. The most enjoyable part of the job was converting an upset customer into a happy customer after providing every service requested by the customer."
bad,Its a job...gives you resume building experiences but not somewhere to make a career.
bad,There is no order in the call center. People are able to come and go as they please.
bad,"First off Xerox and Xerox services are not the same no matter how they try and market it to potential employees. most staff are paid using the ABC methodology even for jobs that should not be paid as such. There are some employees that use tick marks on paper to determine how many transaction they worked in a day due to corporate demanding ALL non-exempt employees must be ABC. There are degreed professionals required to use their knowledge to perform reviews of detailed request, but they must be done within a certain amount of time or their pay will suffer so, you see many employees cutting corners, not reviewing throughly and gaming the system to be paid what they want to make. There is no team environment it is all about what each person can make and forget everyone else. "
bad,"negative job atmosphere, the co-workers had bad attitudes and it was hard to stay focus with so much negativity from the work place"
bad,"Good job as far as customer service. Come in and answer phones, solve problems, learn new products and software weekly or monthly"
bad,"Executives eliminating the ""mother Xerox"" service techs for the xerox owned service companies. They pay them less and it shows in the service they provide but hey, the execs are making money. Pay has been pretty flat for almost 10 years before getting the ""IRIF"". Flavor of the month procedures and benchmarks make it hard to be consistent and meet numbers that really matter. District managers were mostly great, regional were ok but kool-aid drinkers. Rediculous schemes to make more $ without the commitment of an actual raise. I liked working on the products and customers were great to deal with. Company car restrictions abound now, they used to be pretty good. Benefits costing more and more and getting less and less options."
bad,It was a great run for 5 years and sorry to see it end so soon. They lost a wonderful employee.
bad,"Xerox has a great dynamic going for itself, however it falls short in training, leadership, and quality among associates.  Not a terrible place to work, but definitely not in my top 10"
bad,"I started here as just a job and saw that i could make a lot of positive changes to help not only the environment but also the company. When i made that known i was quickly promoted due to my work ethic and professionalism. However, my professionalism became the butt of all jokes in the office. I eventually left the company because of the constant harassment and unfair pay."
bad,"Call center position taking inbound Medicare healthcare calls.  Very difficult to get bonus when you first start, and even later on, it could be hard. The hourly rate was only $10.00. But it was rewarding at times, because we were helping seniors with their insurance."
bad,"If you like being a mindless cog in a corporate machine, this is the job for you."
bad,They had too long of days with not enough work to go around.  They were not compassionate if you were sick or had to leave due to an emergency
bad,"As my first job, I found this to be a pretty pleasant experience.  The workload was light and stress free and I had a good working relationship with my co workers and managers.  The best part of this job was the lack of stress and the hours (6-2:30).  The worst part was the boredom and lack of challenges."
bad,I have learned a lot about pension benefits while with the company many nice people there that come from different back grounds
bad,"los días eran siempre iguales"
bad,"It was very difficult to advance within the company. The management believed in the principle that if you're good at what you do, there is no point for you to do anything else."
bad,"my typical day involves taking incoming calls from customers and consultations from other departments."
bad,"I enjoyed working for the client we serviced. Hogan Lovells llp, was the client."
bad,Management is terrible along with training hours. You will not be valued as a person or employee 
bad,"When you start you day you make your self available to take any escalated calls from level 1 support. You follow up with end-user's that still have tickets open that are assigned to you or your group. Troubleshoot desktop, applications or network related issues over various platforms and repeat the process throughout the day."
bad,"When a co-worker does not do their job, and you have to. Once I told my manager things got bad for me at work.  It come down to me getting fired because I would report her. "
bad,"i would pull task from a que process cases from different types of benefits from tanf,foodstamps,medicaid.etc "
bad,"ESM was a great company until we were bough by Xerox Business Services. ESM was a company that believed in Mutual-fair benefit and provided great advancement opportunities for its agents. Once we were bough by Xerox Business Services, all opportunities for internal advancement ceased, all compensation froze, and the relationship between middle/senior-management to the new Executive management strained. The real issue came when someone was asked to move to salary from hourly with no salary adjustment."
bad,VALO tech work not for the light hearted. Value Added Logistics Organization poor working conditions.
bad,I was working for xerox through Verizon.  I previously worked for Verizon in another state and made a lot more money. Be prepared to constantly have to multi task and if you make a mistake they probably will threaten to fire you.  No female managers.
bad,You get the opportunity to learn some transferable skills. Management needs to do a better job to keep employees motivated. Can be a very unprofessional working environment.
bad,Xerox was a great place to work but in the most recent years they have changed to a company that only cares for the stock folders. the employees are just a number that they can terminate at any time.
bad,"However, senior management did not see that the Fire Marshal position was warranted at a 50 plus building complex with over 275 fire sprinkler systems."
bad,"Management catastrophique."
bad,"The job got challenging when the consistent calls from angry customers started rolling in. Management was all over the place, some better than others. It was a bit difficult to move to a different department if requested."
bad,"It used to be a great place to work, but right now they are doing everything they can to benefit the stock holders, and maximize their return.  if this company is around in 10 years i'd e surprised."
bad,I worked for 38 years and the early years we set the standard for service in America.  The time passes management new less and less about field service representatives.  While business started to suffer the quick answer was to remove the employees that had direct contact with the customer.  I had hoped they would build a new and exciting customer base but workers were removed and replaced with contract workers.
bad,Slow advancement and low salary made many supervisors seek other jobs. This is an entry level position to gain managerial skills. Work life balance was good.
bad,"I don't want to, not my favorite place to work, more into money than their agents/ employees. i do not recommend working here to many people, especially since they let people go."
bad,Employees are unpaid for the verbal abuse that they are subjected to and forced to put up with. I had to leave for medical benefits otherwise I would have been there longer.
bad,"The management was good but the hours were really uncomfortable and the job itself was really stressful, plus the goals we had to achieve were nearly impossible."
bad,"Organization is choked by ancient processes, and a lack of competent senior managers.  Recent IRIFs appears to have been non-strategic beyond immediate cost savings.  So moral is low."
bad,"Stay focused. Go in, do your job, and leave. Stay to yourself. It is an adult highschool. The hardest part is dealing with your co workers. The job is fairly easy and management is alright."
bad,"I worked in the solid ink printers R&D group for 8.5 years.  During this time, the prospects for success in the industry continued to deteriorate, and as a result our team's efforts were offset by layoffs and scaling back of the commitment to new products."
bad,"Empresa boa para trabalhar, clima bom, pontual nos vencimentos, apenas precisa melhorar o desenvolvimento profissional da equipe."
bad,"achievement based compensation = if you make a mistake, your pay DECREASES. Minimum wage for 2 months after a TINY mistake which didn't affect anything."
bad,"I wasn't able to finish training due to falling ill and had to miss a week due to Doctors orders of not being able to drive. Tried to work with management to restart training or join another class that was where I was when I had to take my leave of absence. Management declined my suggestions and forced me to resign,"
bad,It's all about who you know and not what you know. Management doesn't listen to their people and doesn't value actual business process knowledge. Most decisions are short term focus.
bad,i had one of the best training instructors at Xerox.  I really liked working for the company it was never the  customers it's when you are supposed to have accommodations and turn in all the appropriate paper work you do not always get those accommodations you never stay on with one supervisor we were constantly being moved around which is not realty a bad thing gives you experience with different supervisor but you will get a supervisor who will tell you that you need to be at work even if you were in a car accident
bad,Xerox is a fast paced call center. I learned a lot about insurance and assisting members with understanding their policies. Management needs a bit of work.
bad,"this is is a very hard company to work for. I found out the hard way that many rules. polices, as well as proceeds change on not  only a daily basis, but can change on an hourly bases as well"
bad,"A typical day can be very stressful.  It is not organized at all, and there should be authorized personnel in the bathrooms because of the unlawful use of narcotics and/or drugs occurring in the bathroom or outside in the parking lot.  It is definitely not a job for older mature individuals to grow."
bad,Xerox was fine during training but once I got on the phone it became stressful. You dont have your own desk and its so much information to try to remember how to get to while being on the phone with impatient members.
bad,overall the training could be much better and the professionalism  too. I do not like how they try to lower the pay once you become  permanent employee.
bad,"Assist in planning and implementing team goals and expectations, "
bad,"A typical day at work is busy talking to clients all shift.  You learn quite a bit about the cell phone company.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to assist customers the way you want, the most enjoyable part is resolving the customers issue."
bad,"The working environment was nice since I did the job from home, supporting an insurance company as a contracted employee"
bad,The job was very nice. Trainers and owner was very helpful during my time there. People who worked there made it very comfortable for other workers to progress.
bad,"I have been working at Xerox since November at their Inbound Call Center in Kent. The day of hire the recruiter told me that the pay starts off at 10.50 an hour which was only during training. Once on the production floor the pay automatically goes up to 13.50. Well once we got on the floor the truth was 10.50 was our base pay. The 13.50 is based on your RBC's as in you call time and sales. In actuality we are a service call center not sales so you rare make a sale. They only allow you to clock in 5 minutes prior to scheduled time and expect you to be on the phone in ready mode at the actual scheduled time. There are at least seven tools that have to be open a during the transactions they have a technical malfunction or it doesnt register your password .They dont want you to have your phone on the production floor or its a automatic termination. You only two ten minute breaks and 30 minute lunch break. They monitor your phone activity 24/7 as in they force you to be consistently in ready mode. The communication with the supervisor is through a chat room where everyone can see you requesting for rest room breaks and etc. They grade you each week on your phone call about what you missed according to the script that they give you in training. Not allowed to have your personal items at your desk due to the "" Clean Desk Policy"" so you have to put it in the locker or leave in vehicle. Management acts like they are drill instructors they constantly walks around to see what each employee is doing at there computer .They have alot of rules that I dont agree with along with showing favorites"
bad,"The job is a contracting job so constant work isn't to be expected. If you love traveling and don't have any priorities at home then this job is ideal. To sum it up, this job is more for retirees not for people looking for a career. When it comes to management, they have poor communication for employees and clientele which makes the job very complicating whether it's waiting to hear about the next job date or just knowing when your meet time is with the client."
bad,"Die Atmosphäre bei der Arbeit ist schön aber die Arbeitstage sind nicht in Ordnung."
bad,"The call center was nasty. It always smelled of BO and the chairs were broken and smelled like urine. When I was told to push a customer into keeping a line open when they were calling to cancel a DEAD loved ones line, that was all I could handle. The products and rules changed literally by the minute. If you can deal with an unstructured work environment with a lot of slacker kids, then this is for you."
bad,"The overall job was great. I loved the work and that it was fast paced. However, i was disappointed in lack of management the showing of favor in certain people, and being rushed to do everything."
bad,The atmosphere is good the people are fun and great at their jobs.  the direct management does a good job for the most part but upper management seems disconnected from those on the front lines doing the work and keeping the place running and their lack of understanding has lost them a lot of talented people along the way.
bad,Xerox is a company who is not in tune with the needs of their employees. They are only focused on meeting numbers and do not care if the reps have what they need to be successful.
bad,"De werkzaamheden waren heel leuk, ik heb daar veel geleerd, veel contacten met klanten."
bad,"The training provided was almost purely slogans and reasons why the company is good, as opposed to how to do the job. What little was covered about doing the job mostly amounted to telling us we had tools, but nothing on how to use them properly to assist customers."
bad,Great place to work if you like to kiss butt to get ahead.. Sups and manager have their own favorites and look out for them only... Also a great place to work if you dont plan on advancement
bad,I worked for the company for two years . At first the job was great and fun . But in the last few weeks everything has changed and not for the better . It is stressful I just quit the job do to the stress . Ill take the stress of looking for work over working and not knowing what your check is going to be . Thanks for everything but never again .
bad,"-Great co-workers"
bad,Desafortunadamente los administrativos anteriores manejaron de manera fraudulenta y no equitativa las posiciones dentro de Acs xerox planta 5 tuve que retirarme y últimamente supe que el corporativo de la empresa boost para quien prestan el servicio depuraron todo el personal que manejaba la empresa
bad,"Hard sell, great training for a beginning sales associate. Found it hard to advance in sales career with overly high sales goals."
bad,Good luck is all I can say.   Would not recommend this site to anyone for any job.   The only saving grace are the people you will work with.
bad,"Easy Job, Good Money just not a good work environment, I find Managemant very unprofessional. I enjoy the job just not the people I'm surrounded by. Also the job pay rate is based on scoring of your calls , rating from a 100% to 0% Work guidelines are ridiculous. But more so I rather have a job with a set pay rate!"
bad,management is unprofessional. The pay is low for what we have to put up with. Go to sunpass they get paid more for the same thing we do. No raises.
bad,"A typical day at work includes sitting in a chair and answering incoming calls from customers of a large company. The management is very hypocritical. This company raves how they ""coach"" every week to help you and the company earn more money when in reality it is more of a insult. I have practical been called stupid by my supervisor. We were supposed to be about customer service, so I though when I began training, instead it seemed you had to lie to customers to get them off of the phones as quickly as possible or it affected your compensation. I could not do that so ended up making minimum wage for the most part. They require mandatory overtime every single day you work change your shift whenever someone with better stats wants yours. It was the most degrading place I have ever worked and I have no respect for their practices and unrealistic goal setting."
bad,I can say that being around corwrokers is what completes a good day. The pay structure is not stable meaning that your pay can drop or increase every bi-weekly paycheck. I don't work there anymore. I prefer stable pay.
bad,"I learned how to deal with irate customers, I always got there and signed in before my supervisor got there, when I had an issue with a customer that my supervisor didn't want to deal with he told me ""I don't want to deal with that, figure it out""...The hardest part of the job was having a hard case to deal with, and little to no support to help figure out how to deal with situations that I wasn't trained on. I liked my coworkers because they were understanding because they were pretty much on the same level as me."
bad,"Although Xerox did provide a bonus structure to earn more than the default $10 an hour salary, (should you qualify,) there were no possibilities for a raise. This job consisted of answering incoming telephone calls for Humana insurance members who were on Medicare and had purchased additional insurance. It was very fast paced. Requirements included assisting members with billing, enrollment, benefits and claims questions. Many of these members were on very limited budgets and sometimes had to choose between paying for medications and healthcare, or eating. All too often sales agents had signed up these members without their proper understanding of how their benefits worked, leaving them quite upset when claims did not pay in a manor they were expecting."
bad,I would do it again. The people are different. Plenty of chances to advance.
bad,Xerox needs to use their resources and skills to develop new products and enter new markets. The company is too focused on short term revenue from printers and printing related services with limited long term vision.
bad,"Im always learning new things about my job on a daily bases."
bad,"Play it safe Design. very boring and mindless, most of the design decisions were already made for you."
bad,"You will understand when or if you go there. The project is great most ppl are great but its a call center and the management is a high school click. hard to not be effected by it, when good employees get over looked because they are not part of the in club (not me as i was actually up in the food chain) (so to say)"
bad,This company has seen better days. Good for a recent grad but not for a person who is mid career
bad,"could talk to everybody,work indepently, great work environment"
bad,"A typical day at work can be described as hell. If you aren't someone who handles stress well, this is not the job for you. Customers yell at you all day, very few are nice. They call you every name in the book. You can get sexually harassed over the phone by customers. They blame you for everything they do wrong. During all of this abuse, you have to be polite and sound like you care."
bad,"Horrible place to work! very unprofessional, extremely ghetto, managers act worst then some employees, management does not like to help they more focused on who did what to who to het the position they got like high school all over again"
bad,"My shift varies, it could be a 12noon-9:30pm or a 10:00-7:30pm shift. Cashing customer through a fast past checkout. Processing Returns/Refunds. setting up Merchandise of new products. balancing cash floats and making deposit. Employees, were fun and outgoing, they were of all different ethic background, however i did not fine the management team easy to talk to. Hardest part of the job, was not getting enough hours, the pay rate was not good, and there was no growth. The most enjoyable part of the job is, is that i have acquired great knowledge on the job, that has help me in all work environment, and developing great relationship with employees ."
bad,"a days work at xerox, consists of answering phones from companys, that could not get their xerox machines to work, or had to have supplies ordered. It was a small enviorment, got to make alot of good friends. the management wasnt the best"
bad,They didn’t accommodate the person when came to school or family the manager where not helpful at all not very friendly.I feel that some employees felt the same way I did would not recommend this job to anyone unless they also want to be mistreated.
bad,"Human Resources Benefits Call Center, corporate culture was always unsure where the company was moving and commitment to the employee's working. "
bad,"Xerox offered little benefits and there was a ""salary freeze"" which meant that we could not get pay increases.  It did offer an ability to move up quickly, which is good for the job title but doesn't help much with the pay."
bad,"The pay is piece rate (incentive based pay). If you are not a fast worker, I don't recommend this job. However, you can make great money if you are fast. It can get a little cut throat because co-workers will often cheat to finish work faster, just to get most of the work."
bad,"I am not someone made for this type of job. Fixing cooy machines is like fixing cars, your either into it, or your not. Alot* of training is nexessary and it gets very confusing."
bad,"When I started I worked under a wonderful manager. I enjoyed going to work and did my job well. I never had any issues at all. However, once I moved to my current department, it has been a nightmare. There is favoritism where the managers friends get all kinds of special privileges but if you're not one of them you will always be in trouble. Even if you do exactly what they ask they will find a way to get you in trouble. I went from enjoying going in every day to having to force myself to go. Based on my current experience I cannot recommend."
bad,"I was an intern for xerox last year. After graduation from college, they offered me a full-time opportunity to work in Procurement. Within four months, I was able to accomplish and learn quite a lot. As a Rochester native, I saw this as an opportunity to help rebuild a company that has helped build my community. "
bad,"I would not recommend working here if you wish to have career advancement, room for growth, attentive management or receive a decent raise on a frequent basis. My manager is pretty good but his counterparts are terrible and should have been fired years ago. That's the beauty of this company. Its very difficult to get fired, but equally difficult to get hired or get promoted. You will not be compensated fairly and the company is known for forced retirements and pay cuts."
bad,"Prior to the merger, the work environment was very productive, cohesive and positive. After the merger it became complicated to execute responsibilities effectively. Immediate management was great, upper management had different methods of communicating. This is understandable when it comes to mergers; however my team received pay cuts and other downgrades as a result."
bad,Only management gets perks of the job. They expect too much and pay much less. A simple thank you goes a long way until 5 years go by and you are still making the same amount of a Mc Donald's employee
bad,10 1/2 years and although the work was challenging and most the time a lot of fun it could suck the life blood out of you.  The particular client I had was very demanding and made work/life balance almost impossible.
bad,Mi experiencia en Artes gráficas en general buena. Me desenvuelvo perfectamente
bad,"The company is in the BPO business with good fortune 500 clients... but the management is lacking. There seems to be bad communication and a lack of planning. Classes are added with little time to recruit, and classes are cancelled with as little as 24 hours notice."
bad,"This is a great place for anyone looking a quick job. However, if you want something long term this isn't the place for for you. It is hard to move up."
bad,"xerox has really good incentives and bonuses but if you have kids i wouldn't recommend it, the schedules are trash, the supervisors are lazy and the policies they have in place are a little to drastic. in training we were told the schedules go by attendance but that was a lie , i was there every day on time and still got a trashy schedule. i hated it there, and the distance i had to drive to get there was absolutely not worth it. if you do not have kids and your young i do suggest you apply because the money is the only thing good about the company, everything else,  i could honestly pass on."
bad,"Good company to work for. Consistently busy with inbound calls. Learned how to multi task and problem solve. Dealt with Department of Education and financial aid as well as, Schools and award year and amounts"
bad,"Transportation Management Systems is a very ""tight nich"" market, with endless opportunities, but it is currently being poorly managed, and too focused on cutting cost in short term, rather than the big picture."
bad,"The money is decent, but the attitudes and people of management could be a lot better. You can go and practically live there and make great money, but management just sees you as a number. There are some good campaigns to work for if you get lucky. Overall I would recommend it to the younger crowd just coming out of Highschool and maybe early 20's."
bad,the benefits and pay are decent but the hours and job itself were definitely not desirable. dealing with angry customers your entire shift from dawn till dusk as you watch the sun go down from your cubical is not a pleasnt work place.
bad,Though the constant pay and guaranteed work hours;this job is difficult and not for the light hearted
bad,"I think employees have lost confidence in management's ability to pull us out of an 18 year slump.  Stock is heading lower, and a lot of people are leaving."
bad,"typical day at work; take calls, customer services and upselling "
bad,"Back to back calls virtually all day, it can be very stressful. The systems are VERY slow, and that latency causes callers to get irate and impatient. I learned valuable customer service techniques and developed knowledge of health insurances, as well as standards and procedures of the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid (CMS). Given that there is constant turnover, management never develops a solid foundation and lack simple, but important, management skills, like being able to promote intrinsic motivation through positive feedback. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult callers that are mad and/or disappointed with the insurance."
bad,TMS Health is a company under Xerox. The benefits can be much better. This company contracted for Roche who I was working for.
bad,"Good manager to work with , provides freedom of the deliverable associated. Easily we can learn new things with the help of management."
bad,"No upkeep of the facility; trash and cigarette butts all around exterior doors, broken locks on restroom stall doors, no hand soap, broken chairs, inadequate breakrooms, dirty desks, stained cubicles. No enforcement of the rules; behavior, attendance.  Training classes are too large, hurried thru material, not enough specific training. none of training has systems that allow follow-thru to completion-so you can't retain anything because you never are allowed to complete anything."
bad,"Worked in a call center on the London, Ky site for several years. Started out pretty great but slowly the place has become a living nightmare. Constant policy changes and no one knows what is actually going on. But hey, its a job and pays the bills."
bad,"This company had just acquired Sprint. I was hired early in the transition process. The company was assessing their position no only in the Market place but from an economic position as well. With change comes uncertain change. "
bad,"Took inbound calls all day assisting internal and external customers."
bad,Xerox is a great company to work for if you like to be overworked and underpaid.  Some of the staff are wonderful however upper management not so much.  Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,"o	Responsible for Analyzing Requirements in accordance with client specifications for the client State Street (STT) H&W setup. Reviewing test plans and creating complex Test Plans as per Client requirements. Unit testing and rigorous functionality testing to check if all Setup is working as required. Regression testing done to prevent bugs in CAT (Client Acceptance Testing)."
bad,"Retention the least of they're values.  Ever changing schedule with little to no control, and not the best 'career', but an adequate job."
bad,"Conforme o funcionário evolui no desempenho da atividade, a Xerox procura, por procedimentos internos, aprimorar e ampliar a visão sobre como evoluir profissionalmente utilizando as próprias ferramentas de trabalho."
bad,"The learning is good but the pay per hour, availability days for job, and strict hours during lunch can be improved."
bad,"Was stuck in a cubicle all day, managing emails and such things with Outlook. Best part of the job was when I got to pass out the mail to all of the cubicles, because it allowed for some human interaction."
bad,"Very statifying work, but job safety and uppper management needs improvement."
bad,"When you first are hired, it is as a temp.  Good luck getting kept on full time.  Trainer was there from New Jersey and was great but then once you get on the phones, things come up that you were NEVER trained on.  ""Floor walkers"" sometimes have attitudes but you get that anywhere you work!!!  Let's put it this way, if I was a Verizon employee, I would not want this company handling my health insurance benefits.  The way they handle ""escalation calls"" is absolutely absurd.  The client would call in 10 different times and talk to 10 different people.  They can never just talk to ONE person from the beginning of the problem until it is resolved and the calls are not documented well enough to where each new person talking to the client can fully explain the progress on the case, which leaves the client completely frustrated."
bad,"10 anni di lavoro in azienda e mandato a casa tramite una cessione di ramo di azienda ,in modo tale da uscirne puliti , durata dopo la cessione di ramo di azienda ? 14 giorni !"
bad,"Almost everyone i met hated their job and hated assisting new comers.Most of the management was rude and took their power too far. I would never work here again. Not only are the callers disrespectful, so are your fellow employees."
bad,"This is a new contract for this company providing assistance for a cable company. What I have had to deal with since starting with this company has been less than thrilling and getting more upsetting the longer I'm here. The training for four weeks did nothing to prepare the section I'm in to properly do our job once we took live calls. If keeping customers happy about the provider they are with is their goal, then this training issue needs to be addressed seriously. Customers believe they are talking to a seasoned person and grow upset when the agent they are talking to sounds like a beginner. This is like no other training scenario I've delt with in any job much less a call center. It's almost turned into a joke to take count of the number of people who have left out of frustration."
bad,"A typical day at Xerox was coming in, finding a seat at a station, get the computer set up and get ready to take customer calls in the morning. We were customer service for Verizon Wireless. We would take customer calls about changing calling plans, read customer bills, analyze them and help the customer understand what the information in the bill meant to them. We dealt with calling plan cancellation and every day questions about their business with Verizon Wireless. I learned how to talk to customers and manage the call. First call resolution, taking care of the reason the customer called on the first call to the best of my ability. With various types of customers that call in, you learn how to manage your stress, how to multitask and be friendly and understanding while on the phone. The management left a great deal to be desired. Very unprofessional and rude. Overall I was pleased with my co-workers. We were all starting together and even if people have been there for a long time, they were friendly. The hardest part of the job at first was the stress level and high call volume. When that became easier and I became use to it, it was the management that was the issue. The most enjoyable part of the job were the co-workers. Nice people and the job was full time which is always a positive."
bad,It was a great work environment. But there was no room for growth.
bad,I worked on one side of the building and the job was great but when they lost that contract i was forced to work on the other side of the building i went from making $15 an hour to piece pay and than they lost that contract i would not recommend this job to anyone
bad,"Reporting to Helpdesk Manager and Account Teams; responsible for account management, reporting to account teams with month-end results and providing floor support to agents."
bad,"I learned alot  about healthcare and medicaid services and found great joy in my ability to actually assist a customer. Most of  management simply followed directives as the Texas Medicaid Healthcare Partnership (TMHP) division stopped caring for the customers' needs.They chose no longer focus on providing quality care to it's Medicaid clients and providers. The Focus was on quantity and the number of calls taken per day. Accomplished by merely being able to say some one was available to ""answer the call"". "
bad,I worked with the customer directly to ensure there account and billing issues was being resolve. I handle all calls about the sprint cellphone. If a customer called in problems connecting to the web via cellphone or unable to access features on the phone I had to work with them in getting the problems resolved. I was able to take the information that was provided to me in training and use it in my personal life as well as my professional life as far as helping friends and family with the cellphone issues. I liked the management team at the company. They made it so that you was able to access them whenever there was something that required there attention. I was a very large company so I was not able to really engage with the employees of the company however I knew and with a lot of the people that was working there. The most difficult part of the job was if there was something that I was not able to help the customer get resolved and I had advise them there was nothing that we was able to do about that because it was not in or control. I really enjoyed going to work and seeing those that I had developed a friendship with and helping those that didn't know all that I known or answering question for the employees.
bad,"operava maquinas ,quando não tinha serviço na minha maquina eu ajudava em outros setores ,que trabalho em equipe ´´e fundamental para o serviço sair bem ,era boa, não nada a dizer dos meus colegas de trabalho ,foi quando foi dificil no inicio aprender o serviço mais depois que aprendi deu tudo certo , foi a satisfação de ver o meu supervisor entregar o serviço na hora certa"
bad,"Company had terrible values and respect for employees, made it to where your family came second to the job, the company was more important is what they directed to you"
bad,"Requirements are not comparable with the pay, a lot of work.  The metrics are impossible to reach. There is constant people calling out about the number of calls waiting, the number of calls that drop.  There is not enough time for follow-up"
bad,"not an enjoyable time, bad scheduling, fast employee turn over Middle English reveue, from Middle French, from feminine past participle of revoir to see again, reexamine, from Old French reveoir, from re- + veoir, veeir to see — more at VIEW"
bad,"My experience at Xerox was fine overall, the one thing i was not OK with was the low pay for a very demanding work. Employees were under a lot of pressure to please the customers, they worked very hard and were dedicated to customer satisfaction, but they most of the time remain stuck in low wages for reasons i still don't get."
bad,"Loved it because I love helping people but the environment, pay and growth within company need to be something they fully focus on. If they actually work with the people they hired and really get to know them, more people would work there and stay longer."
bad,"Xerox Business Services is a third party process agency for private and government projects. The culture is largely just a grinder to get work done. There is little management support, the HR is outsourced and hard to reach."
bad,Fun place to work. Depending on your performance you can pick your schedule. I liked my supervisor. MY team lead was a joke. Just like every work place they play favorites.
bad,"Very low wages for work required for Medicare Part D expertise. Employees are treated as disposable as opposed to assets to the company."
bad,"typical work day was busy"
bad,Xerox let me go after 20 years.  Only gave two weeks of health insurance and cut severance one month prior.  Disgusted after many years of service.  This is not how to treat loyal employees.
bad,"Extremely chaotic, nothing was organized when I worked there. Not a great place to work, needed new managers. I did not enjoy working there at all...."
bad,"great people"
bad,Different company than it once was. Only time will tell if the changes being made will be successful in turning the company around. The people will make the difference.
bad,"Xerox is a company that is a call-center based business. During an eployee's shift you can expect to receive numerous phone calls dealing with agitated individuals from around the world about their cell phone bills, etc."
bad,"I have been working there but they habve 2 problems ; "
bad,The overall culture of Xerox is one of getting work done at all costs usually there is a lack of direction prior to starting projects so on occasion we have to readjust often.
bad,"Xerox does not treat their employees or customers well. It seems like they are going towards the direction of outsourcing all of their sales, which makes it very difficult to be a successful sales rep"
bad,"a typical day at work was getting calls to help customers with their medication orders. i hated the training they gave you because first part was week in the classroom, second part was working in a room full of computers where you already going to be on the computer. i felt like their was no time to learn anything."
bad,"The hours were picked before starting the job, and the company had mandatory 5 hrs of OT  which was fine however they were not flexible. The managers were terrible, there were only a handful of good ones. Most of them slept with employees and violated many rules by promoting women workers after sleeping with them."
bad,El ambiente de trabajo es muy bajo hacia el empleado
bad,To start it is an inbound call center that pays commotion based on how many calls you can push through. No management support no chance for advancement.
bad,I feel that the representatives should not have to do mandatory overtime as well as when someone gets sick do not ding them for not coming to work because they could get more people sick causing them to not show up for their shift. I also dont believe that the representatives should use surveys to be used for our evaluation because when the representative did everything right then they should not have to get that against them and get the score against them.
bad,Connecticut business systems (Xerox) was enjoyable when I first started but after being laid off I can tell this company is nothing more than a greedy corporation with a candy coating. Unfortunately when your a field technician your treated like the rest of the rank and file. this company is all about sales and the sales team. CBS is a revolving door for many people. My experience with the company has thus far been negative within the last few months
bad,Poorly managed office. Not run very well. Had to use faulty and/or damaged equipment. Office was dirty and not maintained. Managers and supervisors were stressed and overworked.
bad,Company has gone through a lot of changes since I left. Overall I wouldn't recommend this company. very poor leadership and unfriendly workplace. Stay away
bad,Management was very lax and not informative. I believe I could have done my job better with the correct and helpful direction in which this place did not provide.
bad,"five weeks of in class training"
bad,"The National Football League is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference and the American Football Conference. The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world"
bad,"Not Recommended. Management plays favorites, very little to no advancement. Overall it felt like you were just a number in a cattle call. You may have a decent immediate supervisor for a minimal amount of time , but that will most likely end quickly due to the high turn over rate."
bad,A very well paying job while it lasted.  It was a very professional work environment for a union job.  Ended up getting laid off a year and a half into working for the company.
bad,"Working at Xerox is a fun environment, all day long your on the phone assisting customers with online orders marking the customers happy building a trust with them."
bad,Great place for Professional growth. Lots and lots of rules to learn and understand. Great place to gain customer service experience and team work orientation.
bad,"Fuji Xerox hires great staff. But it did not have a sustainable culture to retain or reward talent. "
bad,Very chanllenin. No suppoet when needed. felt like we were mentally being abused by coustomers. Keep changing things everyday. ours were not that good.
bad,They don't know which employees are valuable or what their contributions are. Everything is still a old boys network and either you have their favor or you don't.
bad,nice place to work at. growth within the company is available. sales is required along with the customer service. free coffee. break room with a ping pong table.
bad,They focused more on the numbers then anything else. It is not something I enjoy. There was a lot of pressure. They made it impossible to get any bonuses or the higher pay.
bad,i got valuable experience working at Xerox as a Pharmacy Technician. This was a temp job that ended on me. I definitely would go back to this department.
bad,"One of the only pros to working for Xerox in the call center is when you're being paid for the training in a classroom, instead of actually being on the phone. Everything people say negatively about call centers is true. A stressful, fast-paced, slave-like environment. You'll get reprimanded for being even three minutes late, coming back from lunch or break. You will be verbally abused by customers. In the end, there's only so much that a person can take, and it's eventually not worth the money."
bad,This is a job that will hire anyone. Worse stress I have ever had in a job. I could not wait to find other work. Extremely POLITICALLY correct place to work. You are not allowed to be a christian here ... well you are but you are not allowed to express yourself if you are.
bad,The people I worked with were generally polite. The supervisors there did not want to do their job & complained when they had to do so. There were many times I had conflicts with the supervisors because we did our job but they didn't want to do theirs as if they were too good to get back on the phones & assist customers further.
bad,"Job requires you to be on the phone for the duration of the day. Must be able to resolve technical issues with Apple products, but the training is pretty informative."
bad,Help customers with their account and needing to change anything to their account to make their price cheaper than what they were paying at first. Loved the job
bad,Everyday I had to seek and find seating. Typical call center environment. They try to engage employees in seasonal competitions to boost morale. Very relaxed environment.
bad,"•	Provided extensive inbound call support for Sprint customers "
bad,This division of Xerox no longer exists because management failed.  You can't get this job because no one has it anymore.
bad,"Xerox is a place that is always hiring and always room to advance within the company, however they also have a high turn over. As much as Xerox is always hiring they are also always laying off as well."
bad,This location is good for someone that is looking for a job to help supplement their living but not for someone that is looking to make a career out of this location.
bad,"Lower pay scales than average for any position. Limited growth opportunity. Human Resources does not screen applicants appropriately, leaving for a less than desirable workforce."
bad,"Information very tedious to learn, over worked and under paid. Management treats employees unbecoming of an employer. Requests for time off are frowned upon."
bad,"noting much to expect, just like every other call center , with high turnover of employees,the pay was okay, but I wasn't there long enough to know more"
bad,Depending on your performance is how you got treated by your supervisor. But if you did got it is easy to move up to a floor walker or team lead.
bad,"Just another place to work. co workers are nice. easy work. changing management, work is up and down, get to meet many people, good entry level job for people"
bad,"I wish not to work for the company again, they find a poor reason to let employees go when they have been there for quite some time because they don't want to give a raise instead they get ride of the current and hire on new people to continue to pay a lower rate"
bad,I can't say that I'm pleased with Xerox. They have closed the warehouse that I worked in forcing me to take a different job in the company in order to be able to pay my bills.
bad,Xerox was ok to work but it seemed that the bosses did not care about you or what you have going on. All they cared about was you coming to work. Thee were no designated seats
bad,"The job is extremely easy. Making the bonuses and sales quota is heavily promoted but you don't receive much help in getting the information to achieve this goal. You have to do a lot on you're own, make mistakes and learn from them. You can expect very little help from management."
bad,Huge lack of leadership.  Very disorganized. Have sent employees home when it is not busy.  The job itself is not hard and most of the people who work there are really nice.
bad,"enjoy working with the company"
bad,Customer Service Representatives provided clients with information regarding their specific benefits.  Learning was a non-stop process since there are no two cases alike.  I relied heavily on policy.  The most rewarding part of the job was providing positive news to a client in need.
bad,Xerox may be a good company for different area but there is no professionalism for PBM pharmacy and no respect for employees
bad,Unlimited call volume nonstop. Metrics of calls expectations consistently change on a monthly basis. Management ignores you due to the amount of other people working there.
bad,"love the working environment. great people to be around. everyone makes you feel like you are part of the family."
bad,They have so many contracts that dont get renew and then the employee are out of work or get transferred to another campaign and have to start over with the pay rate per hour
bad,"Had a 3 week training course to learn about the Sprint billing program and customer service guide lines. Sat on the phone for 2 to 3 hours at a time trying to resolve customer issues ex. technical support, billing issues etc. met some decent people and management was friendly."
bad,Xerox didn't train very well. Most people were completely unprepared when they got to the floor. I was in the mail order pharmacy dept. The company expected you to resolve all the customers requests in one phone call. And we had a script we had to read and follow. Most of the customers were elderly and didn't have access or knowledge of computers. But they still made us tell each customer how that they can access the website. This made many of them upset right from the start of the phone call. I bent over backwards to help these elderly people. Many of them had no idea what to do when problems arose from prescription issues. Such as denials for various reasons. I would call the Drs and the pharmacy review board to get their prescriptions approved. These poor elderly people had no idea where to even begin.I would often get into trouble for this which I thought was ridiculous. Aren't we supposed to resolve all issues with one phone call? I would want someone to treat my Parents or Grandparents the same way. I understand that Xerox had quotas to meet for the companies they contracted under.There just needs to be a better way.I loved helping people. I just thought the restrictions placed on employees were counterproductive. Breaks were ridiculously short. Not sure they met with Federal regulations. And the pay was low compared to the work we did.
bad,could've used more training to handle customer calls. not worth the little money they paid. short lunches and trainers weren't very knowledgeable or teachable
bad,The function of this workplace is very mild. The company is not consistent with anything they do. The pay is misleading from what you are told during the interview and what you actually make once you start. The authority are totally dysfunctional.
bad,"professional workplace "
bad,"I pushed myself to make it through the 6 week training hoping things would get better although it is just not my type of work. Everyone who helped me and worked with me were very nice, I do not blame them at all. It is just not my type of work, it is not a fun place to work, they expect too much for what they pay and I can see why the turnover is so high. Almost everyone that was in the class with me have already quit."
bad,"A lot of problems, but a work in progress. The right people have been let go and better people have stepped up. I suppose it is better now."
bad,"i like teching the resfresher classes and hellping my team out,i look the way client was able to get the correct information once they talk to me"
bad,I didn't enjoy how much pressure they had put on their employees. I was always stressed out every time I went to work. I would answer to customers who were really rude and didn't understand when I tried explaining something to them.
bad,Xerox was a good company to work for.  I would recommend it to anyone searching for a job.  It is good place to gain experience.  The management team was great.
bad,"La opinión del empleado no sirve de nada, si no estas conforme con algo, pues es mejor no seguir ahí."
bad,The pay is horrible. The training is poor. In and out. They keep adding things to learn for their contacted company and the horrible pay is the same even though their is more to learn.
bad,"To some it's a comfortable job, to others it's something to do, and to some others it is a pit stop job.  This is glorified factory work where you are on the grind for wages that are less than the worth of the work."
bad,I learn how to troubleshoot different Apple products. Co-workers were very helpful and very nice. The hardest part of the job was the shift.
bad,"The environment of the workplace is friendly and everyone is like a family to each other, and everyone management or not tries to support each other."
bad,I didn't like this position because Xerox was transitioning from a saleperson sales force to straight retail.  Xerox was out cometed by many Japaneese brands and lost market share
bad,"For $10 an hour,you too can answer phone calls from rude business customers all day, be forced to move due to financial reasons and be told they won't transfer your job due to length of employment."
bad,"You are just another person taking calls, it doesn't matter if it is you or someone else. I never felt a sense of responsibility to the company. Although they do treat you well and it is better than flipping burgers. You will never ever get a raise. $10 is all there ever ever is, so don't expect to stay long. It is a soft place to land while you are actively seeking other employment, which everyone there is. Smile and nod and don't burn bridges in case you find yourself jobless again one day and need a place to work while seeking better paying employment. They even rehire people they fire, anyone can get a job there. They do have their favorites who can use cell phones all day. Rules are NO cell phones on the floor or you will be terminated. But they do have their favorites they ""over look"" Maybe you too can be one of them! I have a great job now in my profession  and will never return to any type of call center environment. Foul mouthed customers ripping into me while I must be nice to them, is not fair to anyone. I will help someone who respects me as I do them, but Xerox says we have to help those foul mouthed people and can't hang. No, that isn't right in any ones book. I tell them to please call back when they have calmed down. I took that chance of losing my job, but those calls were never listened to. I would have been ok with losing my job over that. I can't speak to someone who is calling us for assistance and not being respectful to me trying to help them. Not everyone is a call center person and I found that out fast. I don't know what is worse, working in retail"
bad,"its not the worst place to work but definitely not the best either."
bad,Bad place to work at.  you are a meer number.  management does not care about anybody.
bad,Great people and collaborative atmosphere.  Company strategic view is not well seen and understood.
bad,"Sweat shop mentality. But anyone can get a job there. No discrimination, a wide variety of cultures."
bad,"Very corporate based. Only interest is making their clients happy, not their employees. Majority of the employees would feel as if they could be replaced at anytime with a new individual."
bad,The management at Xerox was not impressive. They had favorites and would let them do anything they wanted and not work.
bad,xerox is very unorganized and not the best place to work. they dont pay enough for the work you do.
bad,I'm thankful to be an employee at Xerox. I have learned from my mistakes.
bad,* Delivered over-the-phone customer service and technical support at a Supervisor level within an enclosed office setting. Created appeasements and provided mandatory escalations for site engineering for assistance to better solve customer relations. Maintained personal contact at a customer level through phone and email protocols. Work basis consisting from Apple products and applications.
bad,they hire anyone \\ so you work with a bunch of dumb people \\ the pay is awesome and so are the benefits \\ but the reason why your getting paid is to lie and to be yelled at by Verizon customers everyday\\ this is very draining\\ its very hard to just sit there and be yelled at .
bad,A typical day at work is never the same. The job that I do keeps you on your toes and also keeps your mind sharp.
bad,I currently like working at Xerox the company has advancement opportunities.
bad,Take inbound calls for the pharmacist and process their claims. My co workers were very pleasant to work with as well as my manager. My job was very easy
bad,Training class was very big. Training itself was not that informative. Floor support was not helpful. Learned about basic info on pension plans and medical benefits. Management was not the greatest either.  They acted like they were always bothered by everything you asked them. Co- workers felt the same. The hardest part was working for a company that ran that way. Not really any enjoyable moments.
bad,"The work load was constantly on deadlines and too many people were laid off without warning, even thought they were doing their work correctly and efficiently.  They would rehire for those positions at maybe a lower rate.  It was a matter of time that I would be laid off. There were employees also quitting while others were being laid off."
bad,"sometimes it is unfair for employee, the highest working pressure and requiremnts in same industry, but offer lower payment compare to its competitors."
bad,"This company stated that the hourly pay would be $14.00 an hour. Once hired it was only $10.00 with the chance of making $14.00 an hour per surveys you get from customers, that you  cannot tell them to take."
bad,"Dia dinâmico,com uma gerencia que não existia,com pouca aprendizagem,colegas de trabalho agradáveis.A parte mas dificil horários de madrugada pouco orientação e carga muito alta de trabalho. Pessoal agradável companheiro.nenhum tipo de plano de carreira muito fraca."
bad,"This was a good opportunity to gain experience. This job was moved to Houston, TX"
bad,"At first supervisor was a pretty good job and I had a lot of fun."
bad,This is a call center environment. I don't share their vision.
bad,"good place to work, Alot of honest people working there. Ok to get along with management."
bad,Xerox was the worst job I have ever worked at. it is a low paying and unrewarding job. The best part about Xerox was my fellow co-workers who I enjoyed very much.
bad,"Work alchohalic and not employee friendly, nobody knows whether his/her job is remain tomorrow."
bad,Pay is based upon performance but is just not on your performance if a customer does not agree with a policy you as an employee are at fault and are penalized  for  your pay.  You are told that surveys get overturned but they are not overturned in a timely matter and you are left not knowing what is going on with those surveys
bad,"The typical day was removing staples from documents, making copies and data entry."
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,"The best part of the job was the team environment. Placed on teams once we reached the production floor we were able to build working relationships that assisted us throughout the day. "
bad,"Good team work."
bad,Management was non-helpful. Co-workers were good.The way the company treated their employees and customer's was the worst I have ever seen.
bad,"I am working in ACS xerox as a Transaction Analysist, past 9 years"

bad,"I have worked at 4 local call centers and this was by far the worst. "
bad,Transitioning to a service based company. R&D jobs being outsourced at a fast rate
bad,The environment needs an overhaul to create a more professional workplace.
bad,"Accounts Receivable reviews daily, meetings, conference calls with customer both internal and external are weekly.  "
bad,you take calls all day from complaining customers and you dont know how much your going to get paid going into each day constantly changing goals and metrics
bad,its very hectic working there! they are unorganized and somewhat unprofessional. the pay is excellent though
bad,One supervisor would give specific job duties and the next supervisor would give opposite ones.
bad,Recruit customer care agents for our wireless cell phone client using various websites and job fairs.
bad,"answering calls helping angry customers, i do not like taking calls for a call center. taking calls in a regular business environment is fine, i just do not like call centers. They need to be a more understanding company"
bad,"Company on the decline in Wilsonville, Oregon."
bad,It needs better management and doesn't allow for internal growth.
bad,I really didnt like workinf for this company because my pay was based off of what the customer wanted
bad,"Once a great technology company, but now it's abandoning this to pursue a services business model. May be perfect for those seeking this type of environment"
bad,"AWFUL, there was times I believe I wasn't even making minimum wage. I had to work over 100 hours to provide a wage I could kind of live on. The only good thing I learned from that place was how to appreciate any other job I have."
bad,Rough work environment. People looking over their shoulder waiting to be laid off. I was laid off after a year. Great boss though. Great benefits and wonderful colleagues.
bad,This job was a good experience it i will never work for this company again. The company has bed bugs. The work envioent is very childish and unprofessional.
bad,I worked on the health care side. The overall job was good but the  management was terrible. They recently got brought out because they were stealing money from employees and lost the law suit
bad,Currently am working at the retention center they have in Charlotte. The pay is low for the work you do we basically do 3 dept jobs and get paid 10 an hour not to mention the condition of the ceneter. The chairs are old and falling apart the computers are old the cubical walls and floors are dirty. It looks extremely run down.
bad,"This place has a good environment among the representatives however when it comes to management, there are things that need to be altered. This place is unprofessional and unorganized, unethical and sometimes uncomfortable."
bad,"Extensive ELearning opportunity"
bad,A typical day at Xerox is handling 60+ calls from customers wanting to discuss their bill all the way up want to disconnect their service. The customer service representatives were tied down by multiple rules and regulations. Management had a set of obligations they promised to the customer service reps but they never did any of them
bad,"They would have alot of turn overs. The company had alot of health issues like bed bugs, roaches. They were not for the people that was working there. I did enjoy helping customers that need my help. The longer i was helping the more they didnt like it. I believe in the best customer service if im working in there company and helping the customer."
bad,"Not really sure about I definetly loved the people that I worked with and the job was pretty fun and easy, however the store manager where I was at was very rude to all of her employees and kind of made working there miserable."
bad,"Good first job for a person who has not had a job in the call center industry, okay schedules, was told about extra week in training if needed but was not honored"
bad,Receiving inbound calls from members about their prescription drug plan and how it works. Representatives provide members with the education about their Medicare D plan without out having the call being escalated to a Manager and being handled at a timely manner.
bad,a good place for those who are tech savvy and like to talk on the phone. a good place for a stable income.
bad,"Overall company has the right business model and is working toward executing those goals internally and for it to be understood externally. Unfortunately, of the Stakeholders, employees are the least appreciated/compensated."
bad,"Difficult if you are tender hearted, sweet, and/or don't take an exceptional amount of stress dealing with irate customers well."
bad,"Used to be an excellent place to work. But outsourcing and brain drain has destroyed the company work culture and dented its repute as a technology company. Work life balance, compensation benefits are excellent."
bad,"The company demands are protocol which I agree with. The dress for success I love. Some of the supervisors are doing the best they know how. The promotions are rapid, which means RAISES."
bad,This was on okay job position I wished they would have given me more opportunity to advance but they didn't and I had to leave. I did have fun talking to interesting customers addressing concerns and fixing the issues they were having.
bad,"lack of communication with work at home employees.  the company changes hands and ownership every year I was wth them .  Started as RSA medical,  then became Xerox corp, and finally became Conduent corp."
bad,"Just a lot of work, to start with, then kept slowing down each mouth. poor management. lot of good worker. I had to make boxes, put boxes on line, and totes, in ten location, fill box loader, had to make 2000 boxes per shift for the line. then find missing part for the line. twice a year we could trade jobs, with shipping an receiving, an warehousing. some overtime. bosses that dont care about the people. hard part for me was computer system. some time it worked or not at all. best part of the job was the people to work with."
bad,very fast paced & busy place to work but I liked it bc it kept me busy but they have bed bugs & refuse to get the problem resolved. They let people come to work smelling awful with no consequence. They pretty much said all call centers in Indiana have bed bugs which is not true
bad,"This company had to layoff an entire site in Washington due to unknown reasons. The job was manageable and employees were mostly treated fairly, but Xerox has been known to hire and fire at a fast rate."
bad,There working atmosphere is very good. He is provided many facilities for employees likes Game activity and Every fuction celebrate in office. If any employee is work good with quality and efficiency so he give reward of his employee.
bad,"Overall good culture just bad communication and lack of organization. Relaxed atmosphere with job security. Business growing yearly, but employees are not recognized with incentives."
bad,"Enjoyed the training classes, the training supervisor and out of state SMEs (assistants to the training supervisor). The scheduled training time is ideal for those that have reliable transportation. Enjoyed the diverse environment."
bad,"I was good at first, the thing i didn't like about it was that once you first apply for the job you have to take a test which you have to do for all job. After you pass the set you up to get an on the stop interview and they let you know then if your hired or not. after two weeks for training they make you take another test and if you don't pass that test you are fired."
bad,its an awesome place to work. Offers upward mobility and other opportunities. You are able to be promoted and great benefits and hours
bad,"While working there, I really enjoyed my co workers. The different diversities, everyone getting along and helping one another. I really enjoyed my job there. I love helping people. Knowing that I made a clients day, really made me feel great. Knowing that I helped someone life be a little easier! The hardest part of the job was knowing you tried your best to help a client, sometimes the issue may not get resolved. some of the client may not have any family or friends that can assist them. so I do the best I can to help them while there in my care. The managers I had on my job I really enjoyed working for them. They really show that they appreciate you as a employee. They show that they believe in family. That really meant a lot to me."
bad,"I loved doing dispatch for Xerox. we dispatched for roadside assistance. I loved that part, but I was working my full time hours and only getting paid for part time hours. I had brought this to the attention of my supervisor, and he did nothing about that."
bad,"The site I worked at was disgusting. From roaches to fleas you name it, it was there. Not enough pay for work asked of you. Carpet is gross and infested with bugs."
bad,"My supervisor was great but was unrealistic about how green I was in employee benefits. I was very straight forward about my experience in benefits and I would need hands on training. Once I was hired I was left to figure it out myself in an environment I have never been in. Worked on 3 project auditing qualified life event changes, tobacco cessasion, and FMLA/LOA employee tracking. Hardest part was just trying to figure out what it was I was expected to do and know. The people I worked with was great."
bad,For this job you will need absolute open availability. They do not do part time and the customers are very rude. You have to be okay with being yelled at daily.
bad,"A typical day would be taking anywhere between 5-7 escalation calls from agents all while doing administrative work as far as accesses, systems, quality control, and attendance tracking. I have learned an abundance of management skills along with sharpening my multi-tasking skills.  Management should be supportive, warm, and inviting.  My fellow supervisors were awesome and were like a small family.  Hardest part is the escalation calls. Most enjoyable part was going home each day."
bad,"Unprofessional company, no one really seems to know what is"
bad,"Good for managers,not good for developers. No projects,no promotions. only lazy culture. so do not spoil your career. Hire and fire is there. so be careful before joining such."
bad,I had a great position at the time in xerox. There was much that needed to be fixed in the company but the training team I was in worked like a well oiled machine. That does not speak on its current status or anything after I left.
bad,xerox as a company is unorganized and difficult to move up and when moved up raise are not implemented not even for tenured agents.management is not stable .the hardest part of the job is the standard of the quality scoring
bad,This work place can be very challenging and hard to deal with because of the lack of training and the money you get paid is not good enough for the job you are required to do.
bad,"Overall it is a decent place to get customer service skills if you are starting out, but not the best place at all to continue your career."
bad,"You actually service Verizon wireless accounts here,  phone calls are back to back,  I had no problem with management and co workers.  The employees there are great to work with,  the problem is the place is by far the filthiest place I had ever worked in my life, absolutely deplorable.  The microwaves in the employee break room had thick food caked on them ,  the bathrooms were filthy and smelled like old urine, (there were boogers on the bathroom wall) and you had to share head sets as there were no assigned desks. We were told that we would get our own ""squishies"" (you know,  those sponge things that are on the headsets) but apparently the squishies where on backorder...  Also,  they lie to you there,  I was promised $10.00 per hour in training, then $13.60 per hour after 90 days.  While I was in training,  the general manager came into our training class to tell us about an exciting new pay plan, where we would make $10.50 per hour after training with pay raises up to $12.00 per hour.  Apparently, the old plan was based on stats (which I was not told when I was hired)  Then they offered me a 4 day work week with a 10hr shift per day and 3 days off each week,  and on my last day of training,  I was told that shift was no longer available to me and I was offered a 2pm to 11pm shift.  It ended up,  $10.00 per hour of the  2pm to 11pm shift. I ended up quiting before my 90 days were up.  They can't keep employees there and they are always hiring.  Apparently,  they don't understand why they can't keep employees there.  Please allow me to answer.....THEY ARE CHEAP, SHADY AND"
bad,Muito trabalho. Agitação e pressão.
bad,Enjoyed working for them. I was able to relocate when I was ready. The people I worked with were great. Training excellent. I was able to travel and even went to the olympics for work once.
bad,the hardest part of the job was making shore the work is done the best part of the job was knowing your work was done before you left when your working as a team it makes everyone job better
bad,"Uma empresa dinâmica, moderna, sempre colaborando para o seu crescimento e permitindo iniciativas com filosofia de portas abertas."
bad,"good place to work, except employees are too friendly when you only come to work for just work and work only for your paitients"
bad,"On a typical day I would get about 50-60 calls, half of them would be screaming customers that say everything that is wrong with their account or bill is my fault and I need to fix it. All of my supervisors were great, kind, and understanding. My coworkers were very helpful when a supervisor was not able to make it over to me. The hardest part of that job was trying to calm a customer down after they have gotten mad. And trying to explain to them what all of the charges were with them not wanting to understand or them just wanting a credit because it was all wrong because of me. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be when I was able to make an angry customer happy and them end up giving a great rating and having a good conversation with them as well."
bad,"The people working there were great, hours were not the greatest, but the people that called in about there accounts were mostly difficult to work with."
bad,"Good pay, laid back atmosphere and teamwork. "
bad,"Can be a perfect job for a younger person with no family due to a very strict attendance policy and hours of operation. However, it does need a little more organization and structure."
bad,"The job just wasn't for me. I didn't like working in a call center"
bad,This is a good place to work our schedules just change so frequently. this company provides ok benefits. If it was not for the constant change in my work shed it would be a perfect job.
good,Tive bons companheiro de trabalho era na area de operaçao de maquinas era bem corrido .
good,"Quarterly layoffs, never gives raises, poor employee morale and management has no idea of the day to day work.  The only way to get a raise is to leave the company and then come back!"
good,"The atmosphere is dry and depressing, no windows or tv's.  The call center room is closed in . The pay could have been better."
good,"Xerox is an excellent company. Certain Supervisors are not as pleasant, but its an okay place to work. Negative thing is the pay. .63 per call is NOT a great pay rate. Needs to be hourly. In order to make money, 160+ calls per day."
good,"Answer phones, address issues & sell additional services."
good,It's it not a type of job that you want to make a career out of. Limited advancement opportunity
good,Entry level and nothing more.   Worked for longer than 1 year.  Held many different positions from agent to trainer to supervisor to Quality analyst.
good,"é bom, mas a unica coisa que eu não gostava muito era o salario e a carga horaria, fora isso uma boa empresa de trabalhar !!"
good,I this company I found there is NO room for growth or advancement. The people who are in some of the supervisor/sme positions I dont know how they got there or why??
good,The management is not nice at all and the once who try to be nice don't stay very long.  This call center was very unorganized and the work moral is very poor.  The managers are to hard on the employees.  I actually was asked once if I was lying about my kids having strep throat.  Nasty attitudes from the managers.  The work itself is not real hard but can be stressful.
good,"With the years that I have worked for Xerox, I would say the first 2 years were the best! I loved management I had a desire to grow with the company and as time went on, with new management that desire slowly faded away. Too many major changes with no real explanations."
good,"a typical day at work includes answering high volume calls at a fast pace atmosphere."
good,"No raise in 9+ years; bonuses taken away; furloughs; and salary reductions across the board.  If you don't go in as a Xerox employee, you will not go anywhere.  They don't think outside the box - there's no room for that.  It's there way or the highway."
good,Management had no direction.  Management always seem to be looking to write people up. Never get a raise.  Hard to get time off for vacations.
good,"Unclean & unsanitary work environment, extremely long shifts for training (2-11:30), two 10 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch."
good,"Everyday was exciting and challenging at the same time. There are many opportunities for recent college graduates. The out source division lacked organization and leadership at the Bolingbrook, IL location"
good,Managemnet is very unprofessional everyone comes to work when they want to and there is no clarity on info given management engage in personal instead of providing info about the business to ensure employees have correct info
good,"Cold, fast pace call center with no accountability held for the supervisor sleeping with the agents. Crazy pay cuts at where your making less then minimum wage. Yet they offer unlimited overtime so you can get back to your starting wage eventually."
good,"Ubicación variables de oficinas."
good,"This is a good company in the sense of what they are trying to do. In the beginning of me working there they compensation was good, the bonus was fair and was something that could be reached. After a year it was changed when ACS was taken over by Xerox. The bonus became impossible to reach, even for the best. I was ranked top 10 out of 400 plus employees the entire time I was there and I never got a bonus once they changed the way it could be met. The management was also not very helpful. Mostly young kids who were given to much pressure and then took it out on there team. There was no incentive to go above and beyond and the pay was no that well. One nice thing is that overtime was always needed and they gave you chances to bid for your shift. Although the shift bid was not good when you were a lower ranked person at the company because then you ended up with a shift that no one else wanted. They also would get mad if we tried to stand up and stretch our legs or tried to walk around. They wanted us to sit at our desks and take calls non stop no breaks."
good,"nothing was in order, I gave that company my best and my last day of work I can with my chair missing and my headphones gone. my desk was empty and my supervisor was no where to be found"
good,"Granted, I was grateful for the job but it did nothing but add more stress to my life. most of my supervisors were horrible and there was no organization. DONT APPLY HERE."
good,"Every day consists of learning new information about iPhones, iPads, iPods, and iTunes. There are updates constantly being released and it is my responsibility to learn the new information as soon as it is released. "
good,"Typical call center environment forever changing, customer relationship building and team support."
good,Would come into work everyday and sit at a desk and wait for calls to come in. The hardest part of the job would have to be the pay would change depending on the amount of calls you handle in a day
good,"Learned new skills but not a great place for growth."
good,If you like being disrespected all day on the phone and then my management when you give a little feed back it’s a great job for you . It is a miserable place to work . Pay is per call so if your not fast and typing and talking this isn’t the job for you
good,"No chance of advancement unless you are close to your manager you do not get well compensate needing to have experience and be completely bilingual, plus the work environment is poorly professional"
good,"A day at Xerox was a long and stressful one. There wasn't much support or feed back from higher management. I felt like as a supervisor, I stepped up where most did not."
good,"Very important work; however, did not get that ""passion"" or ""feeling"" for Senior team. "
good,I never worked for Xerox.  I worked for an Executive Employment Agency.  All work were temporary.   Did secretarial/clerical work and assisted managers with daily meetings.
good,"Muito mal organizada , e Fora de panejamento , sempre tinha algo errado ."
good,"Het was een leuk bedrijf om voor te werken. Maar in de loop van de jaren zijn er heel veel beperkingen gekomen voor zelfstandige personen zoals ik ben."
good,"Note: Xerox no longer owns the company RTS"
good,Boring Work Environment with stock up higher ups. Training was boring and they gave you unnecessary information. The trainer is sneaky and will get you fired. No Phones allowed on the floor. Some Team Leads don't deserve the position.
good,"its an okay place to work not good management. scoring on all the work that is done high stress long time to get hired on, decent pay, hard work at times."
good,Poor management. Learned not to trust untrained management. Company supports a zero friendship work policy. High work volume and lack of team support. No enjoyable part of this job.
good,Be on calls for customer service. I learned how to troubleshoot a phone. Management was ok you can say didn't keep track of what they really wanted. Co-workers were awesome accquaintances. The hardest part was being firm with customers. Most enjoyable was events.
good,"Management plays favorites! very high school. You have to be in the ""in crowd. No chance for advancement. Its a very dog eat dog world."
good,"The workload is over whelming at time, management is horrible, the company codes, ethics, titles,etc. are not and/or followed or enforced by management."
good,MANAGEMENT - from the time I started and now I have only met my sup once.... some guy likes to boss us around and treat us so terrible. i went over my break one minute and my superior yelled at me rudely and caused a scene - i was so embarrassed and felt uncomfortable.
good,"If you are really in need of a job they do not mind giving you a chance for the experience.  The work is not hard, the problem is the job is no where near professional."
good,This is a great company to work for. You can learn a lot at this company. Great place to start a future. If you every looking for a job XEROX is the place to go.
good,"A typical day at work is provide customer service, assist clients regain access to their accounts,register customers for online financial planning and online health benefits. Worked with different ISPs and troubleshooting.  My job was not easy because I learned that people do not like to listen, but what made my job very enjoyable or worth coming to work was my co-workers."
good,My day would start at 9:00am to 5:00pm. I learned how to take bill payments and select the proper insurance for the medicare customers. I also sent out medications and healthcare supplies .My co workers were helpful. The hardest part was not being able to get a break due to the heavy call volume. The most enjoyable part was having a satisfied customer.
good,Lack of job security and they seems not to care for the welfare of their employees.I was not treated fairly like everyone else and it left me with no choice but to quit
good,"It was a contract job to provide 3rd party assistance in providing health benefits setup for employees. Typical day was adding insurance policies, dependents and setting up medical/dental/401k's"
good,"typical day at Zerox 60-70 inbound calls per day depending on the call volume.. but the management sucked, no one really supports you the job require guidance and patience ..the [pay is good but no bonus or anything"
good,"Always hiring thats the only good part."
good,It needs more accurate balance from training to supervisor to getting everybody the necessities that they need I would like for Xerox to not have young people in higher position. To much authority makes a hothead
good,A typical day starts at 8am and begins with opening mail to prepare for scanning.  The hardest part of the job is the repetition and not knowing what time you will get to go home for the day.
good,"Very busy"
good,"The Salt Lake City Xerox Call Center takes calls for Verizon Wireless Customer Service. Verizon Wireless is the most expensive cellular telephone company in America, and claims to have the best service. The Customer Service Representative addresses customer concerns, such as billing issues, service issues and minor troubleshooting and transfers to other departments. The job is based off of a yes or no resolve, 1-10 scale Customer Survey of whether or not you resolved their problem or not, whereas 10, 9, and 8 are a pass, and 7 to 0 are considered a fail. The reps are only allowed to fail 3 surveys a month or receive a reprimand."
good,"it was a good place to work, good benefits. the incentives were nice and it was good to set your own pay rate"
good,"I would go to work, get on phones. The help was good at time. Sometimes we had to wait because there wasn't enough help or supervisors.  I liked the people I worked with and I did not like sitting all day."
good,the supervisors don't like to assist you with customers and get an attitude when questions are asked. they have a point system in place for attendance where you get penalized for emergencies and it doesn't matter how sick you are they will never send you home and don't care about your health. ultimately its not a healthy work environment. grateful I have a job but currently looking for another one
good,"Company does not work with you on schedules. "
good,"I loved the actual work here, I actually couldn't wait to clock in, the people (most of them) were the problem here, there were a few good people here that were fun to work around, but the majority of the people (managers included) were horrible, the hours were horrible, 1st shift wanted to hog all the work when 2nd shift was supposed to start and the management was spineless, there were people acting ignorant and ghetto in the office and the managers were too scared to act like managers and put a stop to it, I would work at Xerox any day, just not here at this office. Fair warning if you work at this location you might want to make sure your firearm paperwork is current."
good,"at first this seemed like a good opportunity 9 weeks of training at a set wage was great until you reach the production floor and nothing that you learned in training is ever done, there is no support on the floor once you make it there and actually they care more about ratings than actually helping the customer. don't get me wrong it is easy money but once you hit abc pay you wonder if it is even worth it. the people are great but the management is horrible."
good,"Jobs sent off shore and reduction in force happening for years. No stability, management support or compensation for the extra work loads acquired due to reduction in force."
good,"This was a temp assignment but I obtained lots of knowledge on health and wellness, along with managing your hsa's and fsa's, and I learned a new phone computer system."
good,"working for Xerox was difficult due to supervisors, management not being on the same page. It is very unorganized, no room for advancement and no pay raises"
good,j'aimerai être recruter au sain de xerox canada en temps que technicien
good,Average learning experience
good,ok place to work. they dont make you feel to secure about keeping your job.
good,They will tell you what you want to hear just to fill a seat I don't think that they are even in business any more. The work was not hard just the way that management handled situations
good,"Company is in the midst of significant downsizing and offshoring of its labor, to an extent not seen before.  This creates a culture that is focusing more on job security and the future than on achieving business objectives."
good,poor direction / lacking leadership / no true ownership and no proven outlook. it was a great company years ago but they have lost their way and it maybe a little to late to regain the trust of the clients
good,"U.S. Government customers are ""commercial computer software"" or ""commercial technical data"" pursuant to the applicable Federal Acquisition Regulation and agency-specific supplemental regulations. As such, use, duplication, disclosure, modification, and adaptation of the Programs, including documentation and technical data, shall be subject to the licensing restrictions set forth in the applicable Oracle license agreement, and, to the extent applicable, the additional rights set forth in FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer"
good,"This is a job that is very easy to get if you are looking to just make a paycheck. More suited for individuals getting back into the work force, or lower skill set."
good,"I learned Phone related Customer Service"
good,Worked continuously without any benefits or work life balance. Lots of internal politics and management used to tell us to shut up and do what they say. This is not a place I would recommend.
good,"Everybody below E-Suite is treated as cattle.  When your job title requires you to travel 75%+ of the time, why would they institute a corporate-wide policy limited our spending accounts to just airfare."
good,Good place to work but your hours are not consistent and advancement is based on who you know and not what you know. The management staff are rarely on the same page and they don't take in to consideration the opinions of the employees.
good,"As a new employee, it was extremely difficult because from the onset there was little to no guidance. There where multiple challenges which impeded my ability to do my work. And when I complained to get things corrected I became a liability."
good,not ideal for job security as company mainly does projects. most of the time the department was under staffed and over worked. many of the contractors were not really good at English.
good,Pretty good place for a government contract.   People were nice to but the work was okay.  The contract was the same kind of work I did at my former employer before that at CSC.  Except I think CSC was better at it.
good,"Xerox data services was a sweat shop.  A typical day was work, work, work...45 min lunch (whistle blows)...two 10 min breaks.  The staff was small and stressed.  Management was descent and seemed to care.  There was no workplace culture.  The hardest part of the job was getting out and back for lunch without a ""tardy"" (possible job loss).  Other than the extremely low pay and no ability for advancement nor overtime...there were some good people working there."
good,Its was a long time to advance. The people are nice but management and compensation needs work. The calls can be stressful. They are flexible with work attire.
good,"I've dealt with this company for over 10 years. Management is not very good. Employees are just numbers to them, and if you have an idea, your manager will tell you it is stupid or they will take it as their own."
good,"Too challenging especially in a contract were you are required to meet up with expectations of both Xerox and their contract under the Business unit. I was under representation with Travelocity Cruises to start and their needs changes because Xerox was not able to meet up to the contract so they laid off several employees and transferred others (like myself) to Virgin America. The take over to Alaska Airlines also may have something to do with it,"
good,A typical day at work is getting everything set up on your computer and start taking calls from customer's who have a verizon product. Some calls could be very entertaining while you help them with their problems while others can be very difficult with people call you names. I had great co-workers and some very lazy supervisors
good,Managament needs more training on interpersonal skills and communication with employees and how to follow harassment policies.
good,"The company prides itself on hiring people consistently as the turn over rate is so high. The staff receive low pay with ""bonuses"" by meeting certain marks, if you miss one, you're back down to minimum wage for the pay period."
good,I did not enjoy sitting for long periods of time. The people were nice and the training was thorough. I am the type of person who has to be on the move.
good,Er wordt veel van je verwacht voor een minimum salaris. Vrije dagen en vakanties worden eenzijdig door hun bepaald.
good,"Working for Xerox is something you may do for a year or two, unless you are moved to a higher position."
good,You were required to work your 37.5 hours and got written up if you did not.  We worked in environment filled with pest like bed bugs and roaches.  They monitored every minute of our day if you went to bathroom longer than 10mins in the whole day you were written up.  My co workers were great and I loved talking to people everyday.  Hardest part of job is people will be yelling at you all day if not happy but that wasnt so bad I was very good at helping my clients
good,"I worked as an agent for the Humana project. My supervisor was never able to assist with anything. He couldn't contribute to anything or help our team grow. Then, there's the operational manager, who does not listen to her employees issues and concerns. They only care about Humana, regardless to what issues seem to be bothering employees. They do not allow sick days, or time off to take your child to the doctor."
good,"No one knows what is going on. As an employee, you come to work, do what you have to, then leave."
good,Working for xerox has been a great way for me to gain experience in customer service in the medical field. I was working a bcbs campaign and it was ok I learned a lot. I do think they need to hire better management and do a better screening of the employees my overall experience was ok like I said I learned a lot and I can use this as a stepping stone in the workforce.
good,You have a lot of flexibility to do your job at Xerox.  Xerox appears to welcome different perspectives for addressing different challenges.
good,"not recommended, not a good place to work (socal office tech) for a fresh college grad. Commission structure is off for sales reps, lack of diversity and not much support"
good,"Started off as a great place to work, the facility was thriving at its best until it downsized. I learned a lot about the company, this company helped me develop leadership, teamwork, communication, and analytical skills. You will learn to multitask and will be pushed to your limit in working capabilities. I left the company because of high stress and low morale."
good,Very stressful if people have trouble not taking things personally. If you don't like people cussing at you and talking down to you don't work here. Your pretty much on your own if you have trouble.
good,Xerox is a company that has cut back most engineering. The company was not I nice place near the end of my tenure. Layoffs made a very stressful work environment
good,It is not what they make it out to be its very poor supervisors and co-workers. Culture not the cleanest job security really don't do anything benefits are OK.
good,"on the phone all day (which i dont mind), the management was kind but lack of knowledge to help most people progress. Good work life balance but low pay."
good,everyday was definitely a unique day. you never knew what you would run into. Management could use some help with there practices and the policies
good,"Multiple meetings, most time daily. An intense work load for the number of individuals on the account. Lots of last minute deadlines and very late nights to meet those deadlines."
good,"My work there involved dealing with the lives of Medicare Part D members and their medications. Refilled mail order prescriptions daily and advised members of co-pay amounts. At times would need to reach out to members doctor and/or a local pharmacy. "
good,First 4 years with the company was good however the last year with the company was challenging. However overall a pretty good company to work for.
good,"16 hour days without full compensation for hours worked, reimbursement for travel expenses difficult to recover.  Compensation is not compatible with industry standard and very little room for advancement."
good,xerox is a new site. it does have great people and different backrounds of people. it is a good opportunity to serve the elderly with there medication needs making sure they recieve what they are needing in a timely manner
good,Very low pay and high expectations with minimal training. Managers are unprofessional. Dress code is non-existent. Reps have no incentives and no one is on the same page from team-to-team.
good,I liked the job but the supervisor had bad communication skills with the team. Learning items in a short time frame but I am flexible
good,"While this job gives as much overtime as you could possibly ask for, the job itself is very stressful and gives the associate the skills needed to handle very demanding and a constantly changing environment."
good,"Typical day was entering paper, then electronic orders all day in the data management system. Learned to be very organized, detail-oriented and fast, while keeping errors to a minimum. Co-workers were great people! Hardest part was the repetitive motion, system down time and being the only one in that position. I enjoyed the company team building activities and special recognition events."
good,"You are a work slave. They do not care about if you have family or anything else in your life. No excuses for being even 1 minute late you will get a point taken from you. They will hire anyone and keep hiring you back lol. They are a joke really. But you mean nothing to them. You dont get thank you's or good job's, etc! They expect you to get there early and stay HOURS past your clock out time. You can not have social contact time with the people around you. It was probably the worst job of my life."
good,"Overall I'm sure xerox is a great company. However, i expected much more than what was given, from a fortune five hundred company.Looking for a company i can possible retire with.The training began and was very poor, supervisors explained to the class that they took 18 weeks of training and compacted it into 8 weeks. this raised a red flag for me because we were working with medicare members all of which were retired, disabled or elderly. there was not enough computers for everyone in the class and some of the computer programs that we were to use once out of training, we were never trained on. Once out of training they moved what was left of the training class to another class room and we had no supervisors. Low job moral made me hate going to work each day. It was if xerox was not prepared and so we were not prepared. With not many options  i gave my two week notice."
good,"A lot of phone calls. I learned many things, specially was able to learn more about customer service skills."
good,There is no job security with this company. everything is handled unprofessionally. you are given a schedule each week for breaks and lunches. high volume calls. a lot of drama with employees due to the fact that majority of them are family members. no diversity. No a good company to work for. Hard to get time off approved. no benefits.
good,slow sitting down at a computer all day. supervisors could have been more about our jobs than themselves. didn't enjoy the job much but made myself stick it out.
good,"Not interested."
good,"Working here was stressful. Took inbound calls from Sprint customers and got yelled at almost everyday. Management was rude whenever you forgot to do something. Sometime it was hard to reach your goal and they would treat you like a baby. I would never work here again, it was too unorganized and hard to move up in the company."
good,Company does not provide good benefits package and does not do any promotions or pay increase. Most of people that works here are here because of a pay check. Co-workers are really nice and we do love to take care everyone that calls.
good,"I started as a Customer Service Agent with Xerox working with production. I enjoyed learning the various aspects of the job. I made it a goal to reach a certain production percentage of 100%. The standard goal is 95% Quality score. Soon a position opened in the Quality department for which I applied. I enjoyed Quality very much. There was a clear understanding of what was expected. As long as we completed our work and met forty hours per week, we had free choice as to how to work our schedule. After some time with this position I was approached to become the new Trainer (Learning Development Facilitator) for the project. This job entailed working in a classroom setting to train incoming and existing employees. Between scheduled classes I spent my time preparing for upcoming classes, working with the production floor, and reviewing curriculum. Part of the expectation was to provide curriculum feedback for the source material to remain current. I spent a great deal of time working independently while not running a class."
good,"I handled inbound calls for a contracted company that dealt with flexible, dependent, and health savings accounts.  Management was harsh and everything that you did outside of work during the week was contingent on what shift you recieved."
good,schedule for different projects are given last minute if you are on one project and hired project based you don't knoe if you have a job after that project is over you have to fight to become permanent.
good,"The company has a great building with free parking, free shuttle bus, inside cafeteria. Over all friendly co-workers. On the other hand, there is no place for advancement with the company and no bonus or pay-increase, in fact a lot of people who has been with the company for years are leaving because they don't even get a living cost adjustment. There benefits simple suck for a fortune 500 company. Managers just don't care about you they just want you to make the Clients monthly goal so they can get paid for your job. If you ask for a pay-race you will be told that the company its on a pay-freeze and they cant do anything."
good,"A typical day at work would be to come in at 8am, sit at your desk and begin processing claims. Then, after every two hours, you get a 15min break, a thirty minute lunch, and leave when your manager tells you to, due to clean desk policy. This can be anywhere from 12pm to 9pm, and you typically don't know until right before they tell you to go home."
good,Its a good job if you don't have a life or any morals or values. pays very well but you will be fired for the stupidest stuff in the world
good,"An awesome place for co-workers, however management unfortunately not to staff oriented."
good,"There is not a lot (read: any) room to grow within this office in Houston. There is no real incentive to try hard at this company, as you will not be rewarded."
good,"There is too much to list in such a small space...but in few words.....The specific  location I was employed with was not a place that you could really advance with.  There may be some wiggle room in there if you kiss the right tooshy-but other than that, NO.  It is a very high stress job.  One thing I can say is they will work with you when it comes to vacations, time off, etc.  The management is...  :-\   There is absolutely NO STRUCTURE within the management levels and no department boundary when It comes to who runs which dept.  I will stop ranting now....you get the point :)"
good,"a day at my job you get ongoing incoming phone calls about the members plan either they have not recieved their bill and think there coverage is going to end or they need to make a payment, they haven't recieved there id cards. I just provide them with what they need or need to no.I've learned that you have to have alot of patience and empathy in a setting like this. The hardest part of my job is not knowing when it's your time to go. They will lay you off in a blink of an eye. The most enjoyable part of my job is that the member is happy."
good,"Hambiente de trabajo rutinario,desayunas en tu escritorio,saquito de cafe de tu casa,permaneces centado realizando las labores ,con permiso para levantarse unicamente para ir al baño,consulta o recreo."
good,"Xerox was a rewarding experience throughout most of my career there. However, the company changed its course midway through 2010, and never looked back. Most of us were caught unaware, though always suspicious, that the incorporation of a major business process firm (as defines ACS) would begin to more rapidly tear down the infrastructure of the Managed Services business model, where I worked. A lot of people lost their jobs, and we were not given too many alternatives prior to being launched from the company. I wish no ill will against Xerox, as I am just sad that the model changed as rapidly as it did and I along with thousands of others were boxed out."
good,Productive work place Fast pace .Short hours most days. Hours vary frome day to day .
good,Good place to work lots of potential for growth. Co-workers were great the hardest part of the job was committing to the short breaks and lunches.
good,Busy meeting different clients ona day to day basis by way of phone
good,"A typical day at Xerox is full of uncertainty. The start of the shifts are designated, but the end of the shifts are subject to change according to the amount of work to be completed. Scheduled days off and Holidays are also subject to change without notice. The company is filled with individuals that are determined to make a living for themselves and usually get along really well. The management team strives for excellence, but lack the proper managerial etiquette. The hardest part of the job is the inconsistency. I have learned to be open and flexible. I have also learned and mastered the skill of multi-tasking. The most enjoyable parts of the job are knowing that I have a job that doesn't require strenuous activity, a comfortable setting is provided, and all tools needed to successfully complete the day is provided daily."
good,Company does not care about employees or customer. Only the dollar. Leadership has no knowledge of the company and what made it great and what made customers love it. It now has no distinction from its competitors.
good,"New opportunities to grow and learn across departments/work groups.  The hardest part of job is retaining customer.  Also, limited investment in technology limits ability to transform service delivery."
good,"Don't want to trash the entire company but, I worked there 30+ years for Xerox.  I've seen it all,  from a great company in the 70's  down to to one I would not want to recommend in the 2000s."
good,This was a temporary job but it opened new doors and I gain experience in new technologies I did not have before. I learn about calibration and installation together with wiring and configuration of toll systems in the TPK expressway.
good,People are not very good all the time management was extremely poor work conditions was average pay was great for a 30 year vet incoming people pay is bad
good,It was an ok place to work not very great supervisors. Slot of people not wsnting to do their jobs but there were a few who were a great help and added to the company
good,"Long hours high call volume, management is not approachable. The work environment is ok. Good co-workers. Next to 0% chance of advancement in the company."
good,I actually worked for a subsidiary of Xerox so your experience may be very different. I worked for ACS/Xerox. Management was good if you got lucky like I did at first  you will have a great manager. Once I was promoted I was in agony. if my checks didn't still say Xerox I would have thought I had gone to a totally different company. Best of luck but any job is better than the alternative.
good,"I had started on July 1st. went to Nov. 18th 2018. They had you doing a lot of other things besides mail room stuff. Setting up office for meetings, moving copiers around the building."
good,Xerox offered me a chance to transition in my life and with the lack of pressure from my source of income was not another chance to stress. I will always be grateful for that.
good,"Xerox call centers are no joke. You better learn how to preform if you want to work there. Piece rate payment seem nice, but can really kick you in the teeth if you don't truly understand how it works. "
good,"Corporate greed as now seen in hindsight ruined what would have been a decent work environment. The people made the experience, only now more reinforced by class- action outcomes."
good,"I was able to pay bills, but at the end of the day I was not treated nice, the supervisors would threatened your job on the ""sly"" and if you were not the supervisors""pet"" then your job just got harder."
good,"Loved the idea of being able to work from home after the training period, though the management was lacking, there was a major issue of gender bias (against men)."
good,"Dedicated, long serving employees. Management too focused on short term results. Continual reductions in employee headcount without restructuring the workload. Very bureaucratic processes. Expensive benefits. Low bonuses and no raises for many years."
good,Heavy workday on but we makit through it it get tough .But we can handle it keep push it .Sometimes I  feel like its not bad but the people makes it hard for you and thats because there likes and dislike about you.But I have no dislike about anybody they do me Im alright about that I love jesus.
good,"It's a call center, receiving inbound calls doing tech support mostly. My time there was short, mostly because I had issues with selling support plans to individuals. I was also left in managerial limbo for some time, and didn't overall enjoy the work culture."
good,"not bad making airline reservations for people having flight attendant service with airlines and customer service skills, hours were sometimes song when requiring overtime"
good,I dont have much to say about Xerox besides that they need to do something about benefits. When I worked there benefits were not even offered to veteran employees.
good,I would not like to comment on my prior working experience for this company. I do not want to voice my opinion of working in this company at the location I was hired.
good,Xerox was going through transitional changes in the operational management team. Clear employee management is needed resource for their call center team.
good,"It's a nice atmosphere, and let you have the days you need off without a hitch. No a lot of people will stick their heads out for you, you must earn it. Even if you show them you earned it they won't care too much. "
good,Person who is from technical background have only option to grow his carrier at xerox. for a simple operation employee have to suffer more for salary point of view . No fix annual hike. Less option for new designation.
good,It could be a great place to work if there was more adequate training time and material. The leadership left a lot to be desired and in my opinion was the primary cause of the chaotic and careless environment.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. I liked being able to help clients have the knowledge of Medicare and insurance knowledge. Also helping people with their prescriptions. I had a problem with how management handled certain things. It made me feel like not only was I just a number to them, but so were the clients."
good,I worked here for about 5 months and the place had ticks and bed bugs crawling everywhere the last month i worked there. When brought up to management they seemed to not care. Overtime is good hours re fine if you are flexible.
good,There's no job security here.  They will lay tons of people off only to rehire them again after a few months.  Very low pay and no chance for promotional opportunities.
good,"When i started working for this site, everything was great! The environment was fast paced but was not stressful. About a year after I started working, the director was fired and replaced with an absolute moron. for his first act, he started letting go the people who actually did their job well because we were paying them too much. this man also put relentless strain on upper management to push the agents to keep the call times down. That man turned a site that was top third in the nation into a cesspool."
good,Customers and most of the employees where rude unless previously knowing one another. Management was never there to help you but would put you down for little things.
good,"management is awful & tends to be relationships only & personal interests. "
good,"I learn many things of IT related.. Good knowledge in windows administration, maintenance and application support.•	Co-ordination with vendors documentation of all Project related Activities."
good,Don't work there unless they change things for the better pay is no good no incentives nothing and on phones all day not a great place people mad because they can't get there meds right away plus watching elderly people have to pay do much to stay alive while the company makes money hand over fist
good,Work was difficult sometimes. I learned to try and train myself if I needed info. The workplace was like a zoo. The hardest part of the job was trying to move up.
good,"Basically, their turn over rate is high. Mainly because they don't really care for their employees at all. The main goal is to get the customer off the phone as quickly as possible; not to make sure they're truly happy and satisfied, but to get them off the phone line. Bathroom breaks are discouraged. Management's attitude is ""every man for himself"", which in turn causes fellow employees to adopt a ""me before you"" mentality. Job security is non-existent; job advancement is slim-to-none."
good,"My actual job is great, I love it.  But Xerox as a company needs alot of help in how to treat their employees instead of everything being about how much money they can save."
good,"Unprofessional place to work, no accountability for actions and high turnover rate. It needs to be overhauled in a major way. No issues are resolved seems like"
good,"Xerox is not a good place to work if you're working in the call center department. When the project is over and in order to start with another client you have to take the Simms testing. If you do not pass, you are automatically fired. It's too stressful every 2 to 3 months not knowing if you're going to have a job. The management was very unprofessional, when I was laid off, they had 5 other people in the room with me and I felt we should have been told one on one, not as a group. Then they told us to apply for other positions, if we were being laid off why couldn't they just place us somewhere else. They had mandatory overtime when we were very busy, they didn't want you leaving your desk without permission. We didn't get breaks when it was busy and we had to eat at our desk which was hard because every time I tried to eat a call would come through, so I really didn't get to eat lunch. Xerox would be the last place I would work at."
good,Xerox won the bid for Surpass. Company to moving offices to another location outside of the area. Roughly three hours away. Hardest part of this job is knowing the job will end in early part of 2017.
good,"Technical Support/Customer Service Representative:"
good,"Good company, just has a lot of room to grow and improve in different areas. The systems need updated so they are more staff friendly."
good,the job is good as a entry level job. Work environment can be stressful at times. disorganized also dirty work areas. But all in all its a easy job.
good,"Seeing that customer's got accurate billing and trouble shooting as needed. "
good,"Ik vind het altijd leuk om mensen te helpen en hard werken vind ik ook prima. "
good,I am basically working as subject matter expert . Review the team mates work done. I am working in defined benefits role of pension administration.
good,"high volume calls, pay was bad , benefits was not good , friendly people working flexible schedules , Always had to make a certain amount of calls per hour"
good,Nice place to work for the only problem I had was that they held my attandence against me after I got into a car accident
good,working under people who aren't very will trained to be a supervisor is the worst! and having part of your compensation plan determined by the customer ratings is horrible. employees can't help if customers are dissatisfied with Sprint's services.
good,"This company Xerox was very unprofessional, and felt embarrassed to work at a company that was representing Virgin American Airlines. Although I loved working for Virgin American Airlines, being under Xerox I would never return to them."
good,"Working with co-workers made the job easy, the calls on the other hand can be a challenge having to deal with diverse personalities."
good,You can not advance here and your pay is not bad but you do not get any raises because you will be hired as a contract worker with no benefits nor raises.
good,"Poor management staff. The job that you are assigned never changes. There is no room for advancement, The hours are very long and sometimes you have nothing to do for hours on end. Very young management staff which they don't seem to know much more than the person asking for help."
good,"Over the years of working there, I have experienced pay cuts while being promoted in title, but having more responsibilities added to my workload."
good,"due to the location, i need to spend more that 3 hours ahead of time so that i will not be late. workmates are good however, management is not. always need to extend time. no transpo allowance, no food especially if there is a problem with the vicinity that you cant go home."
good,"Dont bothere them, they won't bother you. NO ADVANCEMENT, NO AWARDS, NO INCENTIVES. Low LOW pay. Management is ehh...training is hard, but if need the job JUST STICK WITH IT. The learning period is long, we all started with no knowledge. It gets better and easier, trust me."
good,"Most of the people I have met over the years have been very nice and some of them have become good friends of mine.  They have a lot of different hours you can work.,"
good,"Xerox was more concerned with profit than the care and comfort of their employees. Anytime you do not provide toilet covers in the ladies' bathroom, you had better believe that you are not getting a raise without a fight."
good,"Good Place to work, just work hard and move on. Focus on work and helping agents. Busy client is aways asking for new way of applying work interactions."
good,"It's unfortunate that as a Fortune 500 company, the management is so horrible. The environment in which they carry from day one has seemed to have a ""black cloud"" hanging around. Management doesn't respect their employee's and the company policy literally changes on a daily basis. The pay is decent, and it's a nice place to work if you like to be left alone and you are ok with never getting any recognition for what you do."
good,"This place is great if you're in a bind and need a job ASAP. But wouldn't recommend for long term. The standards are not very reasonable and there is a LOT of pressure to take as many calls as possible, quickly, and perfectly. The survey system is added pressure because you can potentially lose money if a customer is not satisfied with you, even in situations that are out of your hands. The stressful environment can either help you or hinder you, depends on how you operate."
good,"What I really didn't care for is that my schedule was changed to third shift after training, and I was not able to work that shift. Therefore, I had to withdraw from my job.. Which I didn't appreciate."
good,Immediate Supervisor was fantastic but she never got the support she needed from her higher up's.  You can not rely on the upper echelon of this facility to help or care about it's employees except superficially.
good,"Es una empresa que no ofrece mucho crecimiento a nivel personal. Demasiado tedioso los tramites cuando cambias de departamento. Cuando llegan a existir promociones de puesto, te dan el aumento de salario meses despues y en escasas ocasiones. te dan el retroactivo."
good,The company would have been a good experience if I was getting paid more. The Home Depot opened a call center through ACS and we received inbound calls from customers/future customers.
good,"The day of a typical employee of Xerox was very stressful and demanding. Normally people say that a job is what you make of it but honestly you can be one of the most hard working people in the  entire building and the supervisors would find any possible to write you up for if you were not apart of their cliques. The Operations managers never stuck to their words when it came to bonuses and raises, nor did they stand behind their employees work. In other words credit was never given where due. The pay was actually okay if you are still living at home with your parent but if you are trying to make a living of your own you might need a second job but with that issues it was hard because Xerox was never a company that would work with other work schedules."
good,"Xerox is a good place to get started if you are looking to go into IT.  Will the training is swift in nature and delivery, the learning curve is not difficult.  The environment is a bit to relaxed at times but it also provides a sense of fun at the same time.  Overall a good company to work for."
good,"Management is poor. It is based out of Connecticut. Getting a response was very difficult. Though I did everything expected and more, I never received a raise or even an ""atta boy""."
good,"they were on your back like babies."
good,"Service Xerox high volume black and white copiers as well as kip plotters and Hp equipment. There are many aspects to this job like customer service, time management, parts inventory, empolyee communication as well. At this job there is always a need to increase in knowledge."
good,Management was horrible. They were very prejudice. They wouldn't speak to you unless there were visitors visiting the company.
good,Very hectic and chaotic call center. They have many opportunities for advancement into management positions but they don't take care of their employees.
good,The organization is a little hard in terms of getting work done they will ask you to work almost around 10 to 12 per day on an average but when it comes to reward you will not receive any accredations. Hike in salary is very poor
good,"I helped associates select their annual benefits.  I learned all about the different types of benefit plans, I enjoyed the people that I worked for, the hardest part of the job was having to take the Simulation Test and the most enjoyable part about the job was helping the associates"
good,"Xerox is a good company to work for, they are dependable, and have good benefits. Management is in desperate need of replacement, or training.  The current Ops manager doesn't even know how to do the job is his managing,  Yells at people to get on the phone but never takes a call himself.  The moral at the center is extremely low, it honestly feels like you are nothing more than a body in a seat."
good,Nice place to work for a stepping stone in your career. Culture needs improvement within the company and there is room for improvement with management.
good,"Work hard, and harder. Learned transaction processing and some data entry skills, Co-worker are good people. Management needs to be improved."
good,"The location I worked for was very unprofessional as far as staffing.  Promotion was based on who you know, verses the level of achievement by the employee.  The job was a delight, but the environment caused me to bow out gracefully, because I did not want to advance in an unprofessional environment."
good,There is no Job Security or advancement. Many jobs have been outsourced to India. Constant fear of layoffs. Management has been know to hold you back if you try to transfer within company.
good,"The overall job culture created by those who in management was excellent however, their communication skills were lacking when it comes to the day to day running of the company, hence it made executing your required task tedious than necessary and also it created an air of unappreciation, but other wise it was okay."
good,"I was a technical support adviser. The issues were fairly routine solving technical issues for customer."
good,"Initially, woking for Xerox was very attractive.However, the quality of work and employees relation has been declined drastically over the past ten (10) years. It looks like this compnay has a difficulty to aknowledge its employees acheivemetns and encourages the staffs to seek more opportunities."
good,"Came in 15min early most days to boot up all the computer programs I would need."
good,working with customers on phone and helping in all ways possible with ez pass accounts
good,I thought the job was great but the management was not so great. I feel they could value the employees a lot more than they do. The employees are just expendable they don't care whether you come or go because they know they can get rid of you and hire more. Look up their turn over rate you will see what I'm talking about.
good,"I learned how much of an impact providing great customer service towards a customer makes. My job was to assist customers with applying for credit card applications over the phone. Our job primarily consisted of building a great deal of rapport with the customer as we complete the application for them. The overall goal was to make the customer feel like they were important to us, which is why we always had to find a personal connection to each and every caller."
good,"This job was bearable only because of amazing co-workers who provide more support and help than the majority of the management staff. It is almost impossible to get a day off , you cannot take unpaid time off , you must have vacation time available for them to even consider it. Incentive bonuses are based on unreasonable productivity goals,"
good,I met some of the most amazing people while working here but I can honestly say that it was one of the worst companies I have ever worked for as far as managing its people.  It could also just be the specific site that I work for.
good,I've learned adaptability working at an inbound call center.
good,"N/A"
good,A typical day at work starts off by coming a 5mins early to get a jump start to the day. What I've learn on a day to day basis to be a team player and always extend my help whenever I can. Management is okay I feel that there's not any room for advancement within the company.My co-workers are easier to get along with. The hardest part of this job is the fact they merge the mailroom and the print room together and I have to work with what I've got. I've brought my concerns with management but they don't seem to concerned about it. The most enjoyable part of this job is dealing with clientele on a day to day basis. That's pretty much an average day.
good,"Talking to customers and finishing calls for them in a timely manner was very fun and challenging. I enjoyed talking with customers and other agents about work and work related policies. I found that Helping people by clarifying policies, assisting in making payments, and general customer service was very fun for me and I quickly built a rapport with my customers and co workers that made my time there more enjoyable. Management, however, was very difficult to work with in this company. Supervisors have an exceedingly high turnover rate and most agents are tenured over their supervisors. Policies change on such frequent basis that it was not uncommon for managers and supervisors to be completely unaware of new or recently updated policies. My least favorite thing of note on this job was the pay. We were payed on performance that fluctuated on a minute to minute basis and had to be monitored as it was not fully payed out to the employees on several occasions while i worked there."
good,"Arrive at work at 9:00 a.m. and my day began immediately. I worked with candidates non-stop; screening resumes, making sure that candidates met the minimum requirements, completing required assessments, scheduling qualified candidates for interviews, reviewing applications, onboarding selected candidates, dispositioning rejected candidates, ordering drug screens and background investigations, verifying I-9s, and sourcing candidates."
good,"You had to be on the phone a lot and it was fun dealing with customers. I learned how to repair most of Apple's devices. Management was good but most of them were young but good. Co-workers were one of the perks. The hardest part  was the surveys. Plus it was very hard to please Apple customer all the time. If they didnt understand the product and you know you gave them strong help, and they didnt understand you would get a bad servey. The toughest part was getting new schudeles every 3 months and I enjoyed helping customers and hearing how pleased they were because their issue was resolved."
good,Mangement has there bad days as all of us but overall they are okay. Some better than others.
good,A typical day was coming in getting your computer ready and then clocking in. Sometimes the computer would not completely boot up and we would need to reboot or move to another computer. I learned what a good company  Verizon is. I loved my coworkers but do not get a lot of interaction with them except for group meetings. the hardest part of the job is the strain it put on my personal life. Mandatory overtime was all of the time. Training was the most enjoyable part of the whole job.
good,Answer inbound calls from Customers Help them troubleshoot their boost phones and handle Billing needs.
good,Very poor career development. Long hours. But chance to learn core technologies if you motivate yourself.
good,Too unorganized and poor training methodologies. Lack of professionalism from management team.
good,"•	Answering inbound calls"
good,"I liked working for Xerox, except that had a lot of policies that were ridiculous. Very unnecessary anger from people higher up in the company and a lot of demands within a very short period of time."
good,"A typical day at work is answering phones all day. Xerox promises chances for advancement but when you ask about it they laugh at you. Overall the people were great, management was horrid, and they expect you to revolve your life into work. They require mandatory over time for the first week of every month and expect you to work 50+ hours that week."
good,"Gérer les commandes afin d’assurer l’approvisionnement des différents clients avec les bons produits, dans les délais, dans le respect des conditions générales de vente en vigueur, pour une satisfaction client optimale."
good,"it was decent, there is a couple of things that I did not like, the work stations were always messy, because of it I was always sick, and I would get in trouble when I had to stay home because I was so sick."
good,The teams are great but management is lacking. Being 3rd party provider is both fun and taxing at the same time. Currently in a hiring free.
good,A typical work week was 45-70 hours per week.  Compensation was not in line with work demands or hours worked.  Management was disorganized and disjointed between levels.  Merit and increase were very rare and did not adjust for cost of living.  The hardest part of the job was trying to remain competitive and retained.  Constant fear of your position being sent offshore.  The best part of the job was the people that you get to work with.  Some of the best.
good,Decent place to work. Management knows nothing (most of them aren't trained!). Fired 20+ people for not making their marks then raised all the marks! Always some rumor going on about something whether it be lay offs or company pulling their contract. Training is too short and they send you on the floor not knowing fully everything.
good,• Maintain great customer service
good,"This would be a great job for those that have just graduated or just lookng for some extra money. The pay is reasonable but should be paid more for the job duties that are given. Management also is needing a lot of improving as well how the sytstem is operated. You would need to be a strong minded, well kept self individual to maintain longevity. There could be unneccessary drama amongst co workers. During my time of employment I had to learn to defend and keep to myself. Everyone will not stand in your corner as said. Everyone for themselves..... Its has been past time for the company to get its act together. Hopefully they can maintain to continue to exist."
good,The main focus at this employer is on completing work as quickly as possible.
good,"typically busy,I learned a great deal about leadership & management,co-workers ,were ok,hardest part of job lack of diversity,most enjoyable thing about job early work hours."
good,work with your hands repairing xerox equipment. great sales training program. difficult job though. pay is bad. you also have to pay for gas.
good,Normal day of work
good,They like to do the song and dance for the public but treat their employees as objects. No raises in 7 years. They have lowered salaries though
good,"Company is going through a rough time. Senior leaders only care about financials, no raises in 4 years."
good,"I cannot say I thoroughly enjoyed this position. I met some really good people here who I have remained in contact with. This was a data entry position, so productivity, efficiency and accuracy were key to the position. There were some days where the work was done before the day was half over."
good,The issue with this place was no accountability by upper management and no raises given. this is the only issues I had with the company.  My immediate managmebnt was good.  Overall upper management didn't care about the little people.
good,"Overall It was A Great Job Real Laid Back "
good,"Pra mim é uma empresa regular tem bom plano de saúde, VA e PPR mais o salario e muito baixo"
good,a good job if you you are comfortable with a lot of change. Flexibility and customer service are the top attributes everyone should have here. The people are what makes this company.
good,"Xerox-Conduent aka Continuum Business Solutions etc.."
good,"It has been over 4 years since I worked at Xerox, a lot must have changed by now. "
good,Over worked under paid no chance for advancement. Work environment not supportive management employees unprofessional. No encouragement the pay was horrible even for a third party we didn't make half of what IBC was making
good,"This was an American made, family orient company that was turned around by mismanagement of money and poor financial business decisions that cost the company dearly."
good,"Xerox required NDA agreements to work at location I was at.  Am not allowed to discuss job details.  Manager's were hired from floor employees, many complained of little training for new duties and groups for managers were liquid and made holding managers and employees responsible for quotas and stats harder to follow through with.  Were not allowed to have pencils or pens at desks as we were not allowed to write anything physically down, only on the computers themselves.  Breaks and lunches were timed to the second."
good,"While some leaders were very talented at sharing and communicating change, recent changes in upper management suddenly ended this, causing uncertainty"
good,"NA secretaria de educação foi onde comecei o meu primeito emprego,confesso que não foi fácil porque pra mim era tudo novo,fiquei com medo,mai dei a volta por cima e apendi coisas alem do meu serviço,Foi muito bom e agradável meu tempo la."
good,"Too much work being sent ""Offshore"" at the present time.  This puts undue hardship on remaining employees.  They are losing a lot of their knowledge base."
good,"Really a sick culture at my departure December 2018.     Top executives cutting all they can - benefits, promotions, new hires, etc.    The culture was very toxic."
good,what at one time was a GREAT place to work has ground down to a disorganized business. I had many responsibilities in several different companies in the Chicago area. I am familiar with the area and willing to travel
good,"Your day starts early every day, and I hope you love conference calls.  Working with different levels of sales experience, your job is to keep everyone on task, coach, mentor reps and management. Oh, then there is also selling.."
good,Not much chance of promotion. Work life balance was ok for management. Very little job security in current state. Was able to work remote for part of the time.
good,"No chance for advancement, no balance for personal lives. No job security, multiple layoffs during slow periods. You never knew if you were being cut, you literally sat there waiting for the dreaded tap on the shoulder. Management unconcerned about personal life issues."
good,"I have worked for Xerox basically all of my adult life. I have held all kinds of positions and lots of different experiences. As a business analyst on Oracle projects, I would attend team meetings and also internal customer meetings. My favorite part of the job is watching and idea come to fruition during implementation and then helping the employees learn the new systems/skills necessary. Xerox has certainly changed over the years so hard to give an opinion on management and culture but it is definitely going downhill in the most recent years. I thoroughly enjoy my work!"
good,With it's transformation directions seem to shift with the wind with no clearly communicated strategy or ultimate end state.  Lack of Exec leadership and comms at this company is staggering at times.
good,"2.5 hrs before work , took train to job. 14 hr days but very nice place to work NASW. Washington DC.  worked in mail , copy , conference set up , coffee tea etc. stocked every day. checked copiers to make sure operational."
good,terrible work atmosphere. high turn over rate. the company isnt bad but they do not correct the poor management skills of their employees. they don't do much for employee morale.
good,Xerox needs to rethink how they treat their employees. Upper management does not seem to care about the front line customer facing sales people. Please rethink how you treat them.
good,"People are nice, work environment is not modern. Its a good start for internship to learn from experienced staff. Would be nice if more budge spent on equipment upgrade for employees."
good,Huge training classes under temporary employment only to be reduced with assessments.....Once you get to the call center floor is pretty typical contact center work.
good,The job provide knowledge behind customer service experience and learning to work with upset individuals. It was a job position that did not require much experience due to the training that was provided per employee.
good,"Call center enviroment. Responds to telephone inquiries, Informs customers about H&W Benefits and other services available and assesses customer needs"
good,good place bad benefits. No training was provided by the contract. Left us to develop training materials with no previous references. There were several opportunities for improvement.
good,High intensity corporate environment. Over-time is a must for most positions. Personal sacrifice is often over-looked. Not ideal for people with young children
good,"Supervisors will work with their teams closely, but advancement is low. The company participated in company celebrations that you will enjoy. Overall a nice place."
good,The hardest part of the job is being away from my family. I enjoy driving so this job is ideal for me. It's good place to start if you've a new driver.
good,"Good company, average products, bad management. During the time of imported business equipment, they could not adapt to the flood of cheap products. They also had a bad habit of hiring young talent, expecting the impossible and then see who remained after the fallout."
good,Felt like a number on the wall here.  Management really never knew anything about me as a person.  It was always nothing but numbers.  They are a large company but I had worked for larger and never felt this way.
good,"Invested 22+ years as an embedded systems HW and SW developer, systems engineer, individual contributor, and manager for multiple projects over my years there.  Experience and company started out very-well, however, it declined to the point of significant layoffs (including myself in CY2002), with the company now being practically non-existent."
good,I will never work for xerox ever again unless I'm desperate. Its an unfair company with no set schedules and they expect you to be a robot. Sure I had health benefits but they weren't good and I never could schedule a doctors appointment. Also I was forced to work with strep throat.
good,Many days can be stressful due to the lack of support from the management team. Lack of professionalism in the work place starting with the head lead in charge and down to the leads.
good,Typical Day at work is regular dealing with clients. what I've learned how to be professional and Customer service skills. The Project Manager was horrible she is unprofessional treats employees like no respect at all. The job wasn't hard at all but I wouldn't work for a Manager like that.
good,"Management lacked experience, people skills. I believe that experience should be compensated when applying for a position, I did learn, the most enjoyable was the work hours you can come in as early as 7:30am,"
good,"Bosses were fairly restrictive, base pay is low and targets are difficult to achieve without being able to use online marketing or other networking opportunities."
good,"Xerox is a well-known company that is widely recognized for copy machines and service. However, they have also gotten into the outsourcing business. I worked for one of Xerox outsourcing call centers in Charlotte, NC. It is your typical call center that offers stellar customer service training and pays low, low, low wages. This center outsourced its' services to Sprint. The Sprint call center that performed the exact same job duties, with the exact same tools, and training, were getting paid $4 more than we were with benefits. At the Xerox location that I worked at, they split the work area in half. One half was for Sprint, the other half was for government healthcare. The agents that assisted customers on the government health care side were being paid $2 to $3 more than Xerox customer service agents representing Sprint. On top of all of that, the message regularly communicated by management was that there were not going to be any performance reviews for pay increases and no advancements opportunities unless managing Team Leaders quit, got fired, or went on maternity leave. So basically, they promised us ""no future."" I gave Xerox an overall rating of 3 stars because it is a great first job for students coming out of high school that does not have direction. Call center work is a good first job for those people."
good,I worked for Xerox for a long time and truth be told was burnt out.  The division I worked had mediocre management and the company has been left with very little culture.
good,"1. Good Work life balance."
good,"Call center for the state of sc child support enforcement run by Xerox. You were paid per call, every call was recorded, timed and reviewed. It was a toss up of quantity or quality. You received all calls related to child support cases because the actual child support cases workers left their voicemails full intentionally so they did not have to work. Their was zero enforcement on every case called in even after multiple messages being sent to the workers. You would receive backlash for doing your job. Terrible situation for any employee to be in. The call center supervisor was wonderful and was as supportive as she could be given the demands she was also required to meet."
good,"It was an okay place to work.  The work culture in the late evening was not proper for an adult. If you were there for a while, you were sent most of the negative calls."
good,Xerox was a temporary job however there was no benefits offered and consisted of poor managerial skills. I would not recommend to anyone to work there
good,"Very poor leadership and very little communication about overall strategy.  There has been so much change over in upper management, no on really knows what I going on....."
good,Overall I enjoyed most of my time at Xerox. Management needed work. No notice in changes in contract. No seniority for senior employees. No incentives for senior employees.
good,"Foram 13 anos de muita aprendizagem, de muitos momentos bons."
good,"being the only person there over 40 I felt overlooked for a lot of upward movement. I felt disrespected by the young folks working there, called grandma and stuff.  I dont even have grandkids."
good,The Supervisors were disliking each other and did not want other employees to go to those supervisors that they may not like. That to me is what made the job stressful.
good,"Not a Good environment to work"
good,el lugar era callado avia cafe gratis y la gente era amigable.
good,"Standard call center, distant management, high turnover, low morale. This company moved out of Maine despite being the lowest paying center in the USA."
good,"I worked for this company for about a year, Everything started out fine just like any job. However i started to notice management plays favorites as far as who gets promoted, And that tends to lead to bad management throughout the workplace when they can't do their job nor did they deserve to be put in that position in the first place. I loved working with different people everyday and helping them with the issues they would experience. I decided to leave the company when they over hired and me having a later shift would never have a desk or equipment to work with."
good,Very good to work with as this company has world's 3 top clients. Can gain exceptional knowledge in ERPs like SAP and Oracle. Has good work culture supported with strong HR policies.
good,Good People but not dedicated to their employees. Was told I would get a full time position after contract and then was let go. Typical day at work was ok.
good,"Buenas condiciones laborales. "
good,"my typical workday is hopefully busy"
good,"it can be difficult to work there if you have kids. they do not like working with anyone that is a ""single"" parent and no one that will help them on weekends."
good,I have learned a lot for the position I've held. A typical day consist of taking incoming calls and assisting Providers on insurance claims. Management is great. The hardest part of my job is knowing there is only so much that I can do for the Provider when I would like to do more. The most enjoyable part is helping others and receiving good feedback on how I handled my calls
good,The job in itself is not bad but the work environment is a little unprofessional and unsettling. My coworkers are great but I feel like some of the management people need training on how to effectively communicate with others.
good,Xerox use to be a very good company to work for until they put us on a system to pay us accordingly to what we do. Which was fine but if we made more money then they felt we should our rates would be cut down. Which is so unfair. Management are jokes. No professionalism amongst them at all. The print shop is relaxed and not so stressful but quick pace. I enjoy my co workers but i dont enjoy the job anymore. If for any reason u are wanting work for a young person it would be great for them but for a person with alot of responsibility i dont recommend it
good,"The hardest part of my job with Xerox, was not dealing with the members/ patients, but dealing with my staff. There was a lot of favoritism, a lot of misjudgments, and many chances for improving, but instead they dealt with termination."
good,"I was with the company for 18 years and the morale was not very high.  Job perks were deleted and raises were deleted.  Regardless of the perks and raises being deleted, I was a loyal employee that would have remained with them until retirement but my job was transitioned to Manila."
good,"There seemed to very little strategy or focus and people had no respect  for the management teams.  The attitude was  ""I've seen it all before and I am just waiting it out"" until the next reorganization.  The communication about changes was poorly handled and groups would sit around and wait for months for the next change of management to receive marching orders.  Very disorganized with little strategic foucs."
good,"A well structured training, followed by a lot of on the job training as you learn to help customers with technical issues on the phone before your held accountable for difficult metrics, for example they want you to fix computer problems on the phone in average of less than 20 minutes, of course it all depends on the calls. Because of all the turnover you would be moved frequently requiring setting up the workstation with email, and all the other tools needed for service. Overall not a bad job once the pay was raised from $9 to $11 with regular raises to a decent cap of just over $13 an hr. Not a bad job if the management would leave you alone and let you do it."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of sitting at your desk taking inbound calls from Humana Pharmacy customers."
good,I work for Xerox for over 16 years....It was a great company to work for.  I gained a lot of experience and knowledge and appreciate the opportunity afforded to me during my tenure with Xerox.
good,"Conduent is not a horrible organization to work for. A typical day is filled with leadership meetings, call monitoring,coaching and reporting. Unfortunately in the year I've been employed with the organization there hasn't been consistent management. The first SBU was very young, took the job lightly and left the first opportunity made available to her. My current SBU has been replaced by a 70 year old, unfamiliar with the line of business and neither have been able to offer myself or my counterparts the tools needed to grow. The job is in no way difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job is teaching others how to be good at what comes natural for me."
good,For some people sitting and talking to disgruntled customers is something they are able to be content with. I for one could not make myself enthusiastic about going to work everyday.
good,Important to understand the job you're interviewing for. You are an individual within a large department. Be prepared to communicate through email. The culture is up and down. Know the rules and follow them and you may continue to move within other departments and see a pay increase.
good,A typical day at work is trouble shooting computer issues. Replacing hardware that fails. Managment is wonderful. The most enjoyable part of my job is coming in and knowing what todays assignment is and justjump right into it.
good,"Ok job for beginning person in workforce, but not a good place to make a career. Management needs to be consistent and employee work ethics need to improve to be a more productive place to work."
good,"It's a company with potential, but still needs progress. The dynamics between management and employees is barely there."
good,A day at work entailed taking incoming calls from wireless customers 8 to 10 hrs a day depending on the shift in a very high paced environment. Supervisors were hands off unless you were not doing the job appropriately and speaking poorly to customers. Culture in the workplace was very stressful which made it hard to keep a good attitude about the job. I really did not have an enjoyable part of the job it was just a paycheck with a very long commute. which is the reason why I chose to go back to school full time at end of 2012.
good,This is a job with no future this job wants you to address every issue whether the customer wants to address the issue are not. The training is behind the services that is expected to be offered to the customer
good,high turn over rate. Worked for MSO and it was ok. The supervisors were not good at all. There was one supervisor who was not willing to take sup calls which was ridiculous. Honestly they hire just about anybody. I wasnt even asked any interview questions. the recruiter at the time just told me about the job and i was hired. Good job to make money until you find a real job. no way for you to move up unless a supervisor leaves but that rarely happens.
good,I have been with Xerox for a long time on various projects.  The current project that I am on has many flaws within the communication between management and employees.  It is not run in an efficient manner.  The turn over rate is very high because of the quality of the majority of the people hired. The job is very stressful.  I am thankful for all that I have learned regarding technology however.
good,"Take calls assisting customers and preventing them from cancelling, I learned this job can be unorganized and management is not very friendly. My co-workers are majority young, untrained, and or is trying to quit. The average timeframe of someone working with Xerox is 2 years max. The hardest part of the job is keeping a consistent schedule, they have shift bids every 6 months which is not easy to maintain if you have kids . The most enjoyable part of the job is being acknowledge of good work and stats. They do give away prizes concert tickets, panthers tickets, etc."
good,xerox in my opinion is a very immature work place the behavior in that work place and atmosphere is unbelievable. working there was very uncomfortable and i had top resign because of an employee harassment.
good,Compensation is lacking in many hourly positions compared to other service industry companies.  Healthcare benefits are average.  Many locations throughout the world that gives possible relocation to enjoy other cultures while maintaining employment with same company.
good,I do not like that company management. The management was very worst. I never met before like this. In that company there no chance to show the talent.
good,"This is a good place to start in finding an organization that is dedicated to serving their customers and maintaining confidentiality.  Although the management does try to meet the demands of the associates and customers, sometimes they fall short with meeting the demands."
good,"Instead of addressing an employee's personal matter / request, management is too quick to hand issues over to corporate."
good,"A once great company that finds itself in a shirking marketplace and lack of strong leadership to see it through tough times.  "
good,My position was part of the outsourcing process for Xerox Services which is call reduction in work phase out positions I enjoyed my work there and would have love to stayed there and finish out my career
good,"the job itself is ok, management isn't the greatest they are impersonal at best, everyone is so concerned with advancement they overlook the problems that the reps face on the phones. Micro-management at best."
good,"start to manage my design skills "
good,to much drama at the job I like peaceful environments and there was know room for growth and needed a better schedule .The company can use better leaders in charge of things
good,Not job security. They fire people to save money and then give the existing employees the work on top of their own if they want to stay employed.
good,Already posted a review and this company has really gone downhill from where they used to be. For a supervisor pay to not be increased when all other employee except for exempt employees and now there is no pay incentive for advancement seems pretty ridiculous to want to move up in responsibility.
good,"this job was rough in more than one way. First, it was difficult to get management to work with me if i had to call in sick, and i always ha doctor's excuses which were supposed to count as excused absences. I had a rough time trying to file my ADA AA paper work and was called multiple times, by the same person,  after giving my resignation asking why I was not at work."
good,A typical day at work consist of processing numerous applications for Medicaid or Famis and answering the eligibility workers questions pertaining to policy or processing.  It is usually a busy day every day. Most enjoyable part of the job is the incentive games. The most hardest is dealing with the fact that your walking on egg shells everyday not knowing if your getting fired or layed off next. So many people get fired weekly.
good,The company in a whole needs to review the policies that are involved with the occurence pointing system. In whole the coworkers that I worked with are wonderful. I learned a lot regarding any and all situations regarding auto mobile paperwork.
good,If you have nightmares of a job you work at a lot then you know it's a stressful place to work at.  This job will put you to your limits as a customer service agent.  You will get to meet all sorts of people as you build skills on how to interact in different situations.
good,This is an OK job. I didn't have a problem with my employees or management. I just recommend this job to someone starting their first job.
good,"A typical day at Xerox is fast paced, stressful, but fairly easy. "
good,This contract did not last long at all. I loved talking to members and educating them on company's service but no job security. This one of my favorite jobs but I was hoping for long term. Overall a great experience working in health care.
good,"no comment for this job, work there and make your own decision. It has it's ups and downs like all businesses. ....... ........ ....... ......"
good,"Si bien uno puede disfrutar un dia laborando en la empresa, conforme pasan los dias descubres la falta de administracion que tiene, asi como el poco interes que tienen en sus empleados. He pasado mi tiempo laborando aqui sin haber hecho firma de un contrato el cual fue ya exigido en mas de una ocasion. Denota la falta de buen juicio al tomar decisiones, los supervisores y gerentes fueron elegidos porque no ""habia de otra"" y carecen de muchas habilidades de administracion, trato y manejo de personal las cuales al final del dia dejan a los empleados inconformes y con una ansia por renunciar."
good,if youre in need of a job asap perfect fit but as far as long term or making a career i wouldn't recommend it. they are unorganized and definitely don't treat others fairly.
good,Great pay and benefits. what I learned from this employer is if you know someone on the inside you will get hired. However if you apply for the company five times but do not have pull on the inside you will not be hired even if you are the best candidate for the job. The company is not willing to work with your schedule. When they need employees to work is when you will be working. The most enjoyable part about the job is the training. However what you are trained on is not what you will be doing and some of the material you're trained on is pointless to your job.
good,"The company as a whole is a good company. However, some of the smaller campaigns are not so great. I would  recommend. I would recommend Xerox if you can land a good campaign. If not, I would say to run the other way,"
good,"this job is hard but i've many learned in this job, its funny because of many workers, sometimes feel bad but its part of the work"
good,"As many jobs as possible are being shipped overseas. Even customer facing management positions. Customers are expected to teleconference instead of having a sit-down meeting with the person running the account. Contract workers are constantly furloughed without warning. This is NOT a company that seems to want to take care of it's employees. Raises were frozen for several years (understandable given the recent economy), but shortly after raise freezes were lifted, they adjusted pay grades unfavorably, forcing managers to take back many of the raises they had just given out."
good,"The training was good, it was from 6am to 4 pm. But when going on the floor, my schedule changed to 3pm-12am. Which messed up my lifestyle.. but I stuck it out. "
good,"This company says it provides support for its agents and career advancement, etc. I saw it was a big lie, favoritism was prevalent in the workplace, poor communication from upper management to floor agents. Poor supervisory standards, commitments to the workers were talked about but never kept."
good,"Management does not care like they say, they make to many decisions that hurt the employees. I have worked there for over 2 years now I am there because I need a job, I used to love working there but management changed. they promote people who are not qualified and will not promote the people who know what they are doing."
good,"*Apertura del local y responsable del mismo"
good,....Still . I loved the co-workers and some customers . however working here was very stressful. I never had time to go to school or handle important business because of the hours they had .
good,"overall not a place i felt would help me progress due to the pay,"
good,A typical day at Xerox would be answering inbound and outbound phone calls concerning truck drivers that are broken down and need service to be sent out to them. I learned so much about the different parts of an 18 wheeler truck. Management was very uptight about achieving monthly goals and took points off for every line you forgot to say on the phone. Phone calls were evaluated daily. Co workers were very rude while others were on the phone and management was more concerned about everything else except the job. The hardest part of the job was getting one on one time with the supervisor in order to understand what you were doing wrong and how it can be improved. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people that were just as serious as you in wanting to learn the job and establishing a friendship afterwards.
good,I love the company and the opportunities the company have available. They pay is not great at all. Co-workers are sometimes hard to work with. Management is so so. They can really do better with who they choose for those positions. I would say the most enjoyable part is helping customers.
good,It was an ok place of employment. Employees had little chance of advancement within the workplace. There was a tremendous lack of communication between management and employees regarding requirements to handle customer concerns.
good,"A typical day at work was like going into any job, and experiencing the expected and unexpected. I feel like the majority of the people at my Xerox site, from management to supervisors to customer service agents... were negative and did not like their job. "
good,"On the phone for 8 hours a day assisting customers with their specific needs on their accounts. The wireless phone company we worked for had many policy changes, high prices and lack of communication with their stores. The majority of customers were angry with the company, and the solutions we were given to provide for the customer were only temporary. Lack of support for the customer service representatives on the floor leaving us with a more difficult job than we already had. I loved talking with new customers all day, angry or not. I understood they were not made with customer service but with the company's higher-ups. The turn-over rate is extremely high for these reasons."
good,"Xerox used to be a fun place to work with room for advancement, but is no longer.  They are only concerned with the bottom line and the people are not people - they are a number that adds to the bottom line."
good,"Set hourly schedule, Mandatory overtime, no benefits, little PTO time, pay is OK, but no advancement in company.. plus management needs work.. I strongly advise you not to make this a permanent job."
good,It is a job like most. The customer service side is very unpredictable and changes everyday. Helping people is more important than worrying about the negatives of the job field.
good,"A typical day at work is feeling like you are under a microscope."
good,"Virtue and a vice. It's a steady 40 hours a week, but upper management is immature and highly unprofessional in my exact location."
good,"It was not flexible when it came to families and children. Very difficult to take some time off when your little ones are sick. No breathing room. The building I worked in was very filthy - Sanitation environment was very, very poor."
good,greeting customers assisting with whatever there needs were in pertaining to customer service. I also loved working with and getting to know my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was accepting the fact that i cannot help everyone although i tried. I did love being there and i loved the experience.
good,"It is a very strick setting in the Charlotte, NC  and Cary office. Raleigh, NC was a much better enviornment and flexible. The hardest part of the job was trying to reach HR, bathroom breaks are not paid for and the hours always change, usually nights no matter how well you do in training. At the Charlotte office they do not tell you in advance what your hours are and they change them at a drop of a hat with no regard to your outside schedrule."
good,"Great place to meet great people, your co-workers. "
good,The beginning of the day is to log into the system and computer. The rep the proceeds to take calls for two hours and then break. Then the rep continues the work for another two until the 4hr split which was the hardest part of the job. They promise 15 dollars an hour and start with 9 dollars.  It call Rate Base Pay which is set by their formula.  The rep is alone at home and with limited support through chats.  I worked an at home project.
good,"The job at the start was very simple and fun, however as time has passed it has become hard to go to work do to lack of support by supervisors and benefits."
good,I was very fast on the phones with my handle time on calls and even with me working an extra half hour every day i was behind on the number of calls we needed.  The management beat down the supervisors who in return needed to beat down the representatives.
good,"Typical call center environment.  Attempts to reward those who work hard with an avenue of advancement, but opportunities are rare and hard to find."
good,Worst job ever did not like it at all. very stressful and unorganized.
good,L’équipe de production était toujours à l’écoute des clients et prête à garantir le meilleur service
good,"A work day at Xerox is repetitive. I appreciated the relaxed dress code and we were even allowed ear buds. I learned it is better to do speak up about a mistake when it first happens because anything can be fixed but, the efficiency in which it is fixed depends on personal accountability and being unafraid to admit your mistakes. Management has favorites. Many of the younger employees were let go simply because they chose not to socialize with other staff about their own personal life. there was nothing hard about this job. the most enjoyable part was the constant work over flow, which means over time and more money. I also liked that there was no dress code and that we were allowed to listen to music."
good,"Great co-workers, company hampered by contract, time system for agents not proven to work correctly thus most of time spent correcting a system that should work, already."
good,"typical day consisted of taking phone calls from borrowers pertaining to their student loan accounts. processing deferments, forbearances and making changes as requested to accounts."
good,Learning the material to understand and handle calls for humana healthcare members. Everyone is professinal to a certain degree when it comes to my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is to understand so much material and in a short time manner. The most enjoyable moments is being able to use the discounts which come with working at Xerox.
good,"Training does not go hand-in-hand with client system. However, the client's system is the resource material. High turn-over rate due to poor responsibility to compensation ratio."
good,the management didnt really listen when I had a problem about what was going on with some of the other employees there.
good,"While it is a good job,solid wages, the culture at the company is one of you're in, no one cares.  The upper echelon gets raises and bonuses, but the company can't afford any cost of living raises.  Training is minimal, but so is expectations."
good,With commission pay is not bad but do not expect much outside life here once employed is you will be working 5-6 days per week 10+ hours a day.
good,"ALL I CAN SAY IS, DO YOUR JOB, NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS. Some of the supervisors has snotty attitudes and are looking to get you fired. The workers are very friendly which is a disadvantage in the environment given that all of the cubicles are stacked right together"
good,"Average pay, great supervisors. To much in the lines of politics, regarding advancement."
good,"Somente em um dia aprendi várias coisas como copiar,encadernar,etc e isso é bom para se desenvolver na função."
good,They lie to you day one and keep lying until you get on the floor then the truths about your pay comes out.
good,"64 hour work weeks."
good,Great Company resources for employees. I learned lots of about products and service sold
good,"a decent job but very poorly managed, the training is not well thoughtout but there are helpful people accessible, its a hard job."
good,I learned a lot about how cell phones worked. there was no where close to buy lunch and the people were allowed to chew tobacco and spit in cups while on the phone
good,"I love that I face new challenges every day and I come into work not knowing what the day will hold. Unfortunately, they're downsizing and my job isn't secure any longer."
good,"-not a good work environment"
good,Job was very dirty and you could not stay clean.  Worked backwards 8 hour shift work. Job was temp to hire full time.  Pay was very low and union would not recognize the new plant as a full union member but we all were required to pay dues.  Once in full time the only advancement was to 1 position within that same plant.  We could not bid to other plant sites.
good,"Clock watcher, that dont really care much for their employees. Its all about the stats"
good,"I feel as if I was duped by this company. They stated from interview and even still that they are a 'family-style' company. Since being there over a year now I would say it is the FARTHEST from being a 'family-style' company. I'm sure others would agree we look like numbers and dollar signs NOT people or an important part of the company as YES we are smaller 'pawns' however without us the 'machine' stops. All in all the most of the persons I work with are amazing and the rest, well, they are not as 'family' or 'friendly' as they stated they are."
good,A typical day was login in the phone talking to customers and trouble shooting phone the co-workers were nice the management need better ways to express the changes in the company the hardest parts was meeting the stats
good,"Typical day at work is sitting and answering calls as they come in both English and Spanish. Never worked in Customer Service before and I have learned quit a bit about what a good customer service rep is, I have managed to learn to multitask while on the phone and to be patient and really listen to each customers issues. Management is not very friendly, they look down and talk down to the employees, they use the phrase ""if you don't like it then there's the door"" often. As far as co-workers I do not know anyone's name as we are not allowed to fraternize with each other, the only time we get together is every 3 months for a quick team meeting. Hardest part of the job was at the beginning and getting use to clients calling in and calling me nasty names, cursing at me and telling me how worthless I was."
good,"Take calls, take lunch, breaks, have coachings and one on ones with supervisors. Helping customers daily."
good,"Typically, everyday, you clock in, take calls, clock out. The job itself is not difficult. It can be mentally stressful and difficult to get time off when absolutely needed. The management is hit and miss. Most of the supervisors spend more time painting their nails or smoking cigarettes outside in groups, rather than assisting agents with questions or concerns. The co-workers are the real reason for working here. They're friendly, co-dependent and they understand you. They get it. The hardest part of the job is the low wages, the stress and no advancement opportunites. The most enjoyable part of the job is........well, I guess your co-workers. You start out as project-based making $9/per hour, then once they decide to make you full-time, you drop to $8/per hour and eligible for less than great benefits."
good,"Busy most of the time and often challenging because management doesn't usually know what's going on in the different States that you are answering calls on.  Poor updated training, communication and accountability.  Implemented new pay system and not able to answer questions about the pay scale process, it's always passed on from person to person and then that person is never available to answer your questions.  Will not work with your schedule even if you are a seasoned employee and family does not matter.  Advancement is a joke and you actually get paid less the the customer service reps."
good,"A typical day included working entirely in Excel, which made my eyes vibrate after a while, but it kept me busy, which was good."
good,"but i think management is poor, breakroom is so small no where to enjoy your breaks at."
good,"•	Managed and restructured the supplemental unemployment benefits plan for employees effected due to a reduction in force within the company"
good,"At Xerox it is our duty to provide any and all customers with the up most support.  I was responsible for assisting with various different concerns from Verizon Wireless customers.  I enjoyed my co-workers, but I can not say the same about management.  This company does not do much to assist a new learner and will not give you time for improvement.  I believe that the duties of quality assurance is to tell a customer service representative what they can do to improve, but that never happened.  If you are looking for something stable this is not where you should look."
good,A typical day consisted of taking phone calls and assisting with cell phone technical support.
good,"Fast work, Break when you want, Lunch when you want. Horrible management."
good,"Very disorganized, agents don't feel valued and just another job out there.. Not the best place to work, you only get 10 minute breaks and they don't pay you if you have to go the bathroom in between breaks and lunches"
good,"this job was very laid back thats one of the many reasons I like it , my co workers were all cool most older than me but they were fun and helpful , got the job through local staffing agency"
good,"I would not recommend this company to anyone. I started as an at homer and in July 2012, I was told by my new sup that I have to work from the office due to my QA scores have been too low since Jan 2012. I had worked from home for the last 3.5 yrs. The QA team is not consisted when they are scoring rtms, not keeping in mind they are controlling people's pay. You are not allowed to have a bad week cause your scores will drop along with your pay."
good,high turn over rate. i am advancing but not fast enough
good,"40+ hours available, Direct contact with Humana and Wellpoint customers, Management is demanding, Co-workers have limited education, Requires excellence required at all times and Earned paid time off is difficult to have approved by management and easy to develop new relationships with co-workers."
good,the job is very stressful. i do enjoy working with my co-workers. the hardest part of my job is being cursed out by customers and being called out of your name. the most enjoyable part of of my job is meeting new people.
good,"a typical work day is hard and unrewarding , they just want you to be on the phone , and they always make you feel unimportant everyday"
good,"Amongst my peers it felt like I was surrounded by family and close friends, and I had lots of fun times working there. Although, it was not all fun and games, you have to be able to handle a lot of stress, and be able to mult-task in order to get the job done."
good,"I would clock in, start taking calls. Worked under pressure but acquire experience that later helped me land as a supervisor in another company."
good,"Work day starts at 8am ends at 5pm "
good,Diverse workplace to work.  Flexible work hours.  Able to work remotely with flexibility. The hardest part of working at this company would be the morale with a lot of the jobs being outsourced.
good,Just hired on thru temp agency. They bring people in with no plans to direct hire anyone on. Beware and watch out. Everything is fine as long as you go in robotic don't ask questions and don't say anything. The staffing agency doesn't support nor care about you there.
good,Distribution has gone to third party logistics. The company doesn't value the individual employees and continues to erode benefit packages. Don't look forward to retirement with this company.
good,I was told that I would recieve a higher pay during the interview however my entire training class was lied to. We recieved $5 less then told. I believe that this was very unfair.
good,She hired me because of my experience but did not utilize my skills effectively I would steer clear of working for this company the work environment was not very productive
good,"Hired for one position, helped out in another position, ended up feeling trapped in other position. Unable to switch to shift promised by previous management in original position."
good,"I enjoyed working for Xerox Services. The compensation and benefits were good. "
good,"I have been with Xerox for over 25 years and love the products and the work, just not the direction it has taken over the past few months.  The people are great, management has their hands tied."
good,Good pay. Good people. Bad allocation of resources. Let to many people go and forced the remaining good employees into untenable and unrealistic scope of work. Truly sad because they had good teams but little corporate support.
good,The pay here was really good. But the time that you spend away from your family isn’t work it! The employees were not professional at all. I didn’t enjoy working here too well just because of the company’s employees.
good,"The people are great, but they have numerous pay freezes, and there is little opportunity for growth. They offer benefits, but the benefits are very costly, both in the deductible and paycheck costs."
good,Great team members and collaborative work environment.  Lack of management direction and transparency on business decisions.  Low work life balance environment.
good,"A typical day at work here is answering all inbound calls for Verizon Wireless customers. We would go over bills, make payments, update their phone, replace a phone, troubleshoot a phone, repair a phone, change numbers, add lines, and more. "
good,"My colleagues were largely disgruntled due to lack of decent salaries or bonuses. Most were recruited very young and as a result received bonuses of no more than 10%, which in most cases was not in line with market rate."
good,Long hours low pay but unlimited overtime. Co-workers and supervisors are cool. Advancement is there but supervisor looked very stressed all the time.
good,"The print industry has been getting smaller year after year and the competition more fierce. Xerox management is trying to compete with smaller companies but has too much overhead. While I was at Xerox I learned great customer relation skills, troubleshooting difficult electrical and mechanical problems with great support in the past. The job itself was not difficult, the hardest part of the job was filling my day with extra activities that were not part of the work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and resolving difficult issues that were presented to me."
good,"The job has no appreciation for their employees. There is no proper chain of command, which makes it very unprofessional.The is no room for advancement."
good,Lots of layoffs - minimal job security. People are nice. Somewhat unorganized environment. In 6 months there have been 3 rounds of layoffs in one department. Very uncertain future.
good,They have best product on the market . however sales rep salary is 50k . with out commission . Xerox product is very expensed therefore u will never win customer for pricing just creating product value .
good,The company is going through cutbacks right now and they are laying people off.  My job is fairly easy and my tasks are done fairly quickly.  There is a lot of down time.  The client Xerox works with is difficult.  They are disorganized and rude and they expect you to solve a lot of their problems.  They also try to ignore Xerox policies and try to pressure you into breaking the rules.
good,"They don't go by regulations of a non discrimination job setting.  "
good,was working their very brief. No issues with staff. I wish the plan was more organize and more prepared of what the project was going to be versus walking into a workplace of not knowing what the assignment was.
good,Old corporate culture is strongly felt. Tough times with lots of job turnover. Would not recommend to young people looking to advance. Overall a decent one to work.
good,Management doesn’t know hat direction it’s going. The tools to help us close deals are old and difficult to use. They have fired the majority of their work force and are trying to re model their business plan with no clear road enhas been huge change in leadership and everyone is jumping ship.
good,"No communication from the new CEO at end of third quarter."
good,Call center - Pay was low and there was no pay negotiation. Strict time schedule. Rotating schedule.   Work in environment was terrible as there were employees fighting in the restroom .
good,"ik heb er vele jaren gewerkt zowel op de vloer als op kantoor."
good,"Depending on your group, you can find really great leaders inspiring great work, but unfortunately that is often outweighed by not so great management."
good,I would not recommend Xerox as a place of employment as there culture caters to upper management only. lower level employees are vastly under valued. management lacks basic communication skills.
good,Great people work there. Management and wages could be better. Wages and benefits aren't competitive for the area. They do give free food sometimes and do a lot of charity work.
good,"Little room for advancement when you start as a customer service representative. The are big on promoting within the company, chance to transfer within the organization"
good,Receive inbound calls from majority angry and upset elderly members /customers regarding their insurance policy. There are a lot of unrealistic expectations
good,"The pay was decent, the workload was a little much. The hire contract workers so they don't pay benefits and they recycle people like crazy, They burn through temps like crazy. To this day after 5 years they are still looking for a replacement for me that can last longer than a few months. If you have a great team it is so much easier. The problem is the managers and directors are clueless about the day-today operations and show up once in a while only to show you that they are important."
good,Xerox is a good place to work and I feel that is has room to be much better. In many ways they are lacking the ability to take risk on new hire. if that make sense.
good,"Xerox worked and supported a client at the client site. The workplace culture was very relaxed and friendly. I enjoyed working with and meeting new people. Because I had never worked in a DocuCenter, I learned a lot about the larger equipment used  and how to do some of the jobs. If ever a difficult situation would be presented, it was always worked out resulting in a satisfied client."
good,Pay was not good however the health insurance was pretty good. Management tends to pigeon hole you into whatever role you currently have. Advancement was difficult. I worked there 10 years ago so things may have changed
good,Good place to work until they decided to move most jobs out of the country. Benefits were below average. Immediate management was good. Upper management was bad.
good,"Management wasn't friendly, and tough to go to for questions.  Made me feel very inferior.  My direct manager was never friendly.  I don't think she had the people skills to be a manager"
good,I was a CSE for 38 years. What WAS I thinking. It was great at first. But as time went on Management got more and more greedy. The ones running the show now are as about as in      component as you can get. And don't care. 
good,"The job was stressful, but the pay was achievement based, so I could make more than fellow employees as long as I was efficient at the job, so it balanced that part out. The management could use some help because I knew more than some of the supervisors. The hardest aspect of the job was learning to maintain a level head when dealing with customers that are upset or confused, once I had mastered de-escalation, though, the job became much easier! The most enjoyable part was my coworkers. When you have coworkers you enjoy it also helps enjoy your time at work!"
good,It required all your attention and knowledge...customer based...hands on all aspects of the job..and constantly changing from day to day...operations changed daily..
good,It is a great place to get work experience but not good for long term employment. Call queue was always overflowing and customers could be seemingly impossible to work with.
good,"From what I can remember, Xerox is solid company with a good reputation. Unfortunately, on the Business Services side, you can get lost in the shuffle unless you're an amazing superstar employee.  Management is supportive but the pay is below average."
good,"If you must work there, go to school, because you are not having a career there.  Work is sometimes forty hours and sometimes less. You have to play favorites with management and they lay off people.  The most part of the job was that it was easy to understand.  Least part of the job was no raises and management.  If they let you go, it's right out of left field and your called into the office and terminated."
good,"The big name that is fading due to many bad managerial decisions."
good,"Once I got the hang of the job, and was recognized has doing a good job, and promoted to supervisor, I enjoyed what I did, and enjoyed working with my team and other staff."
good,"Dont believe on that just break with no fun, work work work work.. Mental stressful. not even a TV to relax you mind during you 30 mins break. Take a walk downstairs to relief stress. No fun."
good,"As a temporary job, it is ok."
good,Company did not know what direction it wanted to take. It seemed like upper management did not think things through. Decisions seemed indecisive and lacked clear direction; they were more knee-jerk like.
good,This is a really bad place to be since getting sick is really easy. The reason why I had to resign was because of this. I ended up coughing up blood at the end of this job.
good,"I was at Xerox in a temp role and during my time there I learned alot of office experience front desk reception and was moved from site to site. "
good,I worked at The New Jersey Institute of Technology for Xerox . I did various copy jobs for the departments on the campus . I also delivered supplies to 17 buildings and 52 copier  machines . I used a binder machine and stapler machine . I was replaced by another worker after I worked there a year. I did a good job there and they did not hire me full time or offer me benefits. I had to travel over 40 miles one way . I do not think that I was treated fairly .
good,Started every day the same saw what jobs were on the work table .dropped off to various sites. I was contacted via phone on issues .allowed to work a schedule that benefited both parties.
good,"Working at Xerox was a great experience for myself, learning how to provide customers with the health Insurance to fit their family needs. The hardest part about the job was not being able to provide all of our customers with health Insurance."
good,It is a good entry level opportunity. One of the biggest downsides is that this industry is decreasing in demand. Also it is very micromanaging. Its a good place to start.
good,"Je bent mer nummer dan mens. Leuke werksfeer komt alleen door de collega's, maar die wisselen zo snel dat het amper bij te houden is."
good,Unfortunately the company has taken a different strategy and has eliminated my position as well as the other US Managers in my organization..  Try doing more with less will only make other employees leave on their own.
good,The job is good but there is alot of overtime so if you want to work alot of overtime the job is for you. It is not a job that overs much ways to advance in your career.
good,This company was under a lot of pressure to reduce costs and improve bottom line.  I was pressured to work 7 days a week and excessive hours.  Job was eventually moved to India.
good,"As a data entry clerk I processed BAS and PAYG documents on a daily basis."
good,"Many interesting and innovative projects going on in research, but difficult to maintain funding, staffing, and find the ""path to the sea"" for deployment. Poor leadership at the top, too many unfounded opinions despite the facts."
good,"With the changes moving over to the new company Conduent, it has been difficult. Many layoffs have occurred, there were many tenured, dedicated people let go."
good,"Management was terrible at this location. They do not have regard toward the employees and their needs and the suggestions. The location and people who worked there were all good, but most of the time the management was in the way."
good,"No a huge fan of he company culture. there are always changes and the turn over shows. if you are looking for a transitional job, it will do, but long term is very slim."
good,Working here was manageable. You had to figure out on your own what to do and how to handle situations. Management didn't have answers to most questions.
good,"There are usually good people you work with but the job itself is awful. Most of the supervisors are just terrible. The professionalism you get from your peers almost made me want to stay, but the job was too stressful."
good,Management sucks. The pay and benefits are manageable. The operation manager picks favorites and if you aren't a favorite you will not last long. The work environment is very ghetto
good,"Xerox pays pretty good but it could be better for all the stress and information that you have to process. You can not get sick or have a family working there. Every hour you are scheduled, you have to work, or eventually you will b fired for it."
good,Can get promotions with a little hard work. Freedom to do thing when and how you want to do them. Procedure isn't that big of a priority. Management is t strict they let you work the way you want to as long as you're producing.
good,"Management at the Ridgeland, Mississippi location is very unprofessional, shares salary with non-key personnel, a lot of nepotism, unbiased work environment."
good,"this company was very stressful"
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed being able to help resolve issues and answer questions for the callers. However the position only lasted 6 months because the client declined to renew their contract."
good,My personal experience of a typical day was not very good. The whole environment was stressful. Managers weren't very helpful or caring either. Pay is the only good thing.
good,Xerox is a job that can give you experience at a call center and broaden your horizon for other call centers. The compensation was only 10.00 per hour to start and can be a fun and safe work environment.
good,"Typical day at work - Fair"
good,"As a trainer I was expecting to work here forever. Instead I had to hear from a third party that Xerox/Conduent gave us 60 days notice they are closing. "
good,"Xerox (formerly ACS) was a great place for Cloud exposure. They were young into their years with the Cloud Platform and partnered with VCE to streamline their builds. Work from home was great, management was easy to work with. This portion of the company has now been acquired by ATOS."
good,The traing was not very extensive you learned more being on the phone rather then the training. Customers are not well i formed of what theres benifits. Very stressful job
good,"Xerox was a decent company to work for, but the pay was not sutible for my skillset or my needs. It's a great job for someone with little to no experience  or fresh out of school."
good,"I enjoy the job, but the pay is not very good at all.  Poor management. Not a very good work environment. On a good note I have learned a lot about healthcare claims."
good,"Aprendia a realizar funciones de oficinas administrativas como la elaboracion de oficios, memorandum, archivar documentos, recepcionar material de oficina, realizar facturas, utilizar el conmutardor, fax, copiadora. atencion al cliente."
good,"I will say this, Xerox employs a great deal of amazing individuals. You are sure to make friends and meet good people there. But in this excellent quality lies a flaw. The infamous Popularity Contest. Your opportunity for advancement plummets if a manager doesn't like you. Management is picked by management, so you're either in, or you're slowly but surely out (Stagnant)."
good,Iedereen ervaart deze werkgever anders. De sfeer en collega's zijn leuk. Voor de werkzaamheden moet je jezelf soms er toe verzetten.
good,"The client figured out their mistake and did not go with xerox any further. "
good,"Great company if you are a self starter with little direction needed.  Upper management appears to care about the employees, but has an agenda.  Working with peers and subordinates was fantastic developing lasting relationships and a fun atmosphere."
good,It's an alright job for someone desperately looking for work but definitely no prospects of growth at the workplace.The good thing being that you can listen to music while at work.
good,"Talking to customers every day in a call center, working to make sure the customer is getting the best customer service experience by providing them information as it relates to their Humana plan."
good,"Te vaak wordt er van teamleider gewisseld, er staat dat je 1 x per week een coaching hebt, dat is dan 1 x per maand. Je hoeft maar iets verkeerds te hebben gedaan en ze sturen je al weg ligt er wel aan welke teamleider je hebt. Ze denken niet aan je persoonlijke privé leven mocht er bijvoorbeeld iets ergs zijn gebeurd, het boeit ze helemaal niet."
good,training too long. training is for 9 weeks and we have a test every week. Have to pass each test with an 80 or better to be placed on production floor otherwise will be terminated
good,The job was not secured and it was always changing as far as hours and procedures. The job does not insure that you build a career with them. Or ensure that they would kleep ypu as an employee.
good,É boa empresa para aprender alguns aspectos de venda directa aos clientes.
good,"Loud production floor, high call volume, loud coworkers talking over customer's phone call. Supervisors choosing favoritism."
good,"Determines patient coverage on a case-by-case basis and appeals according to company protocol."
good,"There were some good managers in the workplace but there were more of the don't care supervisors on the production floor. When you needed assistance, some will look and not assist you because they don't like you or your not on their team. Even though they know you have a member on hold and rules apply to not have members on hold."
good,The job was a job. It has plenty of areas of improvement. It has different shifts to choose from starting late and early. you get to sit all day and do research.
good,Constant change in organization and management is a clear sign that the executives are walking blindly forward. Coworkers are extremely talented and used to be an innovative company and there are some reminents of this depending on the department you work in.
good,Not a good company to work for if you're looking for long term work..managment is horrible as well as their company goals
good,En general es buena empresa el detalle es que algunos de sus proyectos no cumplen lo que prometen al contratar
good,"Constant schedule changes that the employees are made to deal with. No say in over time, its mandatory and they will not work with school schedules"
good,I loving helping people to understand their benefits.  Enjoy helping people to make an informed decision on the benefits that are right for them and their family.
good,"I was a rehire from 5 years ago.  When I started I did not have all of my necessary system; such as email, infobank, and other system to preform my job.  I had gotten married since my last employment so I figured that would be easier just starting everything over as new, but apparently they did not the capability to do so.  I had to resign for medical issues, will I return?  NO."
good,"Op het werk, inloggen en hopen dat je systeem het doet. Tijdens training niet of nauwelijks met de systemen kunnen kennis maken maar gelukkig fantastische collega's om je heen die je helpen in tegenstelling tot sommige werkbegeleiders die er alleen voor zichzelf zitten. Personeelszaken is zeer slecht geregeld. Uren worden niet tijdig verwerkt of bij sommige helemaal niet. Reiskosten worden afgekeurd maar ze zeggen niet waarom en vervolgens moet je er zelf achteraan gaan. Mensen wachten maanden op hun geld en komen in de financiele problemen. "
good,"I installed and calibrated instruments that measured flow, level, temperature, and pressure. I also maintained instrumentation by checking and recalibrating if necessary existing instruments."
good,"A typical day at Xerox very interesting the people you may speak with I have learned a lot about different medications the management is the worst I wish sometimes the ceo can come and see how the Xerox sups and mangers act very unprofessional and they yell and people and very disrespectful not all but some, co workers help you get through your day without them the job would be in possiable the hardest part about the job sometimes you cant help everyone the insurance side is very hard to deal with the most enjoyable part of the day helping people"
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with.  Turnover was high and few people stayed for more then two years.  The benefits were very weak.
good,"I can honestly say that it was a laid back environment, but no one seemed to be on the same page.  When it came to ramping down, they would be running around trying to figure out who to let go and who to keep.  I think they need a better system for making that decision because they let some really good people go to keep their minions there."
good,"The usuall Center environment. Wide range of employees from 18 - 50+. Lack of any real support, except through resources which are accessed through system tools that employees. Most Supervisors are busy doing nothing. Some do provide support when general questions come up, by is unlikely they would know the answer, and would have to research.  Floor support was present, but mostly to get people out of callwork, and provide general statements to reps, who in turn provided to customers, usually resulting in escalation."
good,"Awesome chances to learn the rules and regulations for Medicaid."
good,A typical day is just it. It's a place where nothing goes on you are only their to work. Their has been but the cheapest employee work days. Where they spend nothing to keep employees happy or at work.
good,"Over educated under experienced leadership."
good,"The woman in charge of the program likes to ignore phone calls and emails from students. So unless you're constantly emailing her, 24/7, you'll hear a reply when it's convenient for her. While you are free to decide where you'd like to apply, you also have to remember that you are only allowed 25 hours a week. You can't go over or else you'll get in trouble. That's the downside of being in this program."
good,"I have been at Xerox for almost two years.  There is no room for advancement.  It is a very negative atmosphere to work in. Very little in the way of encouragement.  Systems down a lot, constantly changing from one client to another, no consistency.  However on the plus side, they do try to keep employees hired and change them to different clients rather than laying them off."
good,helping a customer you cant see is harder than helping someone out while having them right in front of you there is more demand and aggression towards finding a resolution
good,Customers arent so bad you get those rude customers every once in a while. Management and supervisors can do better in their willingness to help and assist agents. Consideration and value of employees could improve ALOT. has ping pong table but not too much entertainment. co workers can also resemble daycare children instead of adults. On the flip side you get a 50 cent raise every 3 months.
good,"Typical day is fast-paced, customer faced and can be exciting environment to be in. The hardest part is the consistent change in management which is always a refreshing challenge. Most enjoyable is seeing people happy to know that what they contributed is a valuable part of what we do."
good,"Long day which includes constantly being accused of causing problems with user devices. "
good,Xerox was ok to say the least. i love the work i did on a day to day basis but the managment could have been more professional.  they promised there would be room to move up but there were no opportunities presented.
good,"No room for advancement, low pay rate, redundant.  There is not much else to elaborate on.    It is steady work but you will not go anywhere or make more money for that matter."
good,The work environment is very friendly but you're job certainty is not since it is a temp agency you know at any minute that you can be let go from you're job .
good,Xerox is good place to work. This company has a lot of room for growth. This 3rd party vendor places too much responsibility on its employees with not enough compensation.
good,"This job is work, work, work there is a little down time; however, most of the time the que is high so there is no time for a break."
good,Overall a company with good morals-just bad management. Turnover is high and compensation is low. Wouldn't recommend this job to anyone who wants to make sales a career out of it.
good,"A bunch of old dogs still talking a big game- best way to describe it. Management sales tactics are old and don't vibe well with fresh talent. "
good,"It was a great learning experience. Learned great customer service skills, and helped physicians using whati learned"
good,"Pay is good but not flat rate"
good,"Xerox continues to cut corners cut salaries, cut work for and give no raises.  New technologies are slow to weave in. No chance of promotions"
good,"Not at all the worst place to work but could be made better with supportive management.  Having the ability to resolve Member issues is the best part of my position because there is a sense of accomplishment.  Typically, about 50% of the incoming calls are easily resolved and can actually be resolve without being escalated, if the frontline agents had proper training.  The hardest part of my job is having to escalate a Member beyond my scope of responsibility to a Manager who first is unavailable and then is unwilling to speak with the caller.  I do believe the compensation for the level of service required, should be considerably more than that of new, unexperienced agent.  The job is not hard but is monotonous and the only challenge is your ability to resolve the Member's issue.  Also, the ability to advance is very minimal."
good,"Xerox was an very productive workplace. Also , xerox was very busy and sometimes could become very unorganized at times. I loved gaining more experience in customer service."
good,"Exciting environment - client and employees interaction on a daily basis. Never a dull moment -you learn quickly to think out of the box - must be proactive. Have to listen to the voice of the customer, be responsive and to keep commitments. You also learn that the employee is critical to your success - you have to be impartial, consistent and let them know what is expected from them - share the vision."
good,"I've been working at xerox services for 4 years now and I've seen 4 org changes and tossed around 6 different bosses."
good,"The setting was a call center mostly with people under the age of 25 acting like they're still in high school with back stabbing, being two faced, and unable to trust anyone around you. Management never enforces the rules. If you wanted a childish setting and stability because management lets you get away with murder, this job is perfect for you."
good,Not a place I want to be employed with for a long time. No structure and low pay. People here have no respect for other people as well.
good,The job is easy once you get the hang of it. However the supervisors do not approve of self supporting agents. If we assist someone in our team they consider it to be a violation of our contract due to us not being qualified to help.
good,"It was a fun place to work until the company was taking over and then things just changed. I loved my co-workers, my tech, all my supervisors.Like I said it is a nice place to work."
good,a typical day at work was trying to satisfy the customers the best we can cause sprint was having a lot of issues with their service and I had to make my customers happy the best i could also i used to get commitions for sales. and the must important thing resolve customer issue that when they went out of the phone they were happy.the managment was not good they did not care about the employees only about the numbers the coworker were great we were a team for a long time working toguether to find solutions for our customers. the best part of my job was when i was able to resolve an issue that has a long time going on and no one had a solution for it
good,"Good place to build a career, although with big limitations."
good,"When I first got this job I wasn't fully aware of what I was getting myself into I just know I needed something and I needed it now.  Everything ever said or promised in training was either a lie or back tracked the moment we were done with training. The management is not always professional and sometimes the office manager can have a very nasty attitude. Not good for business. Co-workers understand the struggle except for the newbies who don't do half the way but get the same pay. The hardest part of this job and working like a slave and still feeling like it unappreciated or not enough. The most enjoyable thing about this job is clocking out and going home. I will say I've gained quite a bit of knowledge as far as healthcare, medicare and insurance goes. Its an ok job to have for a little while but not something to keep long term if you value your sanity."
good,"A typical day at work started out great in the beginning.  I was properly and fully trained for the position I was hired for.  "
good,It is the typical corporate environment and work/life balance.  However morale is poor as a result of ongoing headcount reductions either through work elimination or work being moved to other lower cost locations around the world.  While that doesn't reduce the company employment level it does eliminate US jobs.
good,"Pendant mon contrat, la seule tâche consistait à corriger les erreurs d'un numériseur calligraphique lorsque des clientes remplissaient les feuillets de promotions."
good,I've learned that customers are always right even when they're wrong. It's my job to get them on track. I also learned tools to become a better salesman
good,Een prettig bedrijf. Het is moeilijk voor mij om iets over dit bedrijf te vertellen. Ik werkte er kort en er waren vele veranderingen.
good,"A typical day at work is being on the phones all day for 10 hours"
good,"Management needs better communication skills.  Co-workers worked well together when given the proper tools.  "
good,"I loved working with the customers but job is difficult to balance what we are expected to do with what customers want. Often doing job correctly results in failing surveys because we can't fix everything on demand. Constant feeling that even if we do everything we can we still failed is very stress inducing. This department is very poor at balance between life and work, several times my shift was changed with little to no warning and there is no acknowledgement that this creates problems for family life. My direct supervisor is excellent but management above him is removed from employees needs. Also not a great fit in jobs for me as I like to be active and this job is all sitting."
good,"A day Xerox is coming into the facility logging into your computer and taking phone calls from customers. If you as the agent needs assistance, they usually have floor coaches to come and assist. Also there is other departments that could  be an assistance to you as well."
good,"Based on my four months with Xerox, it can be unpredictable but overall a good job if you are able to make it past the 90-day period."
good,"training was good, but after that hours changed i was working 1-11pm and that wasnt a good fit for me. the training and team leaders were great, but high turn over rate. hard to get a decent shift, because shift bids were done off seniority, which sucked."
good,"If your a single, college student with alot of free time than this will be a great job for you. the pay was on a sliding scale wish it was a permnant 12-13 an hour then the turn over wouldn't be so high. definitely liked the job was good at it."
good,"It was good pay, but the management is completely incompetent and inappropriate. Supervisors make innapropriate remarks towards employees and offer no additional support."
good,A typical day at work was clocking in and getting down to business. The hardest part of the job is when you have back to back calls for the day and you dont get a chance to breathe between calls. The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers. I also very much enjoyed talking to nee people everyday. Management could be very understanding at times. I just wish they had a attendance policy that was a little more flexible. I have seen first hand that the co-worker with family miss work and lose their job over family emergencies.
good,"•	Answer and respond to incoming calls from employees and former employees with questions about their benefits."
good,Good job but production set where you cant make money.  They want you to learn the job and take your time but only pay 8 buck a hour.  Can earn more with picking up speed but you cant make money if you go slow and try to learn.  Still 10 an hour is typically most you will see.
good,"answering phone calls all day"
good,"If you like to sit at a cubicle for 7 1/2 hours a day; get monitored constantly, and it is frowned upon talking to your co-workers this is the job for you. I've been there over 3 years and have never gotten a raise."
good,"A typical day at work consist of taking inbound phone calls,dealing with constant change, and meeting new people. I stay to myself but most of theSupervisor are down to earth. Best part of the day is making a customer happy on a phone call, and the hardest part is going to work everyday and feeling under appreciated."
good,Working here you learn personal relationships are more important than work ethic and professionalism. It is difficult to stay on task with all the personal drama going on around you.
good,"Work 40+ hours a week, including overtime, but little social life. Set hours/ schedule. No Benefits,  little payed time off  and no chance of advancement in the  company. Overall, the pay is pretty OK."
good,This job is great if you want to learn Medicaid billing however the training was bad and the ppl are very unorganized. Supervisors are very nice and helpful.
good,I love customer service because I love interacting with new people and helping solve issues that may be happening for customers. I learned how to really sell myself and working with customers to make sure they are well taken care of. The hardest part of my job was the fact that there were limited benefits.
good,The branch which I worked had extremely bad management and they were totally unorganized to a point that even priorities designated in a crazy manner when those tasks were not a priority.
good,"Typical work day is not difficult for me, I enjoy what I do here. The actual work is the most enjoyable part of the job,making sure to processess in a timely manner that could affect one's health.  On the contrary, the difficult part is trying to figure out how much you'll be paid biweekly based on the many stipulations of their compensation breakdown."
good,A typical day at work is trying to take the best care of the customer but doing it as fast as you can. I have learned a lot about the clients product that I can use in every day life.
good,It seems like you're in high school. Only favorites are promoted and majority of management act like teenagers. However the work aspect is okay. A job that allows you to learn a lot.
good,"Typical call center job. Employer has multiple departments which can teach you different skills. Management are all friends, the reason they get promoted. Recieve call from very rude people fighting ""bout them benefits"" (lonestare, foodstamps and other benefits.But no limit to OT. Make all the money you want."
good,"a typical day at work is somewhat stressful, co-workers are mouthy to one another as well as to their superiors. i would just recommend working here when you need the income because you are trying to get on your feet. this is a project based job so there is no benefits and it is not permanent. management is not too good because even though they are in a high position they take it to heart and everyone is not treated the same or fairly."
good,"Quality control was my main responsibility, where I gained a lot of knowledge for attention to detail. I had the opportunity to work with many seasoned employees who supplied me with great training. It was a great learning experience."
good,Working at Xerox was a task. The first year with the company I loved it! I loved the money and the hours but I did not like the lack of communication. The facility was not the cleanest and the structure of the company was not great. I enjoyed my fellow co workers and that's what made my working experience there easier. It was very easy for me to progress with the company and that is one thing that I loved and they also worked with my school schedule.
good,"start out logging onto system...learned how the process of indexing is conducted....co-workers fun to work with...hardest part is, one never know when your shift will end."
good,"Very Busy, but H.R. Department is exstremly un-organized. Training on what we do could be improved."
good,"had supervisor start rumors about me that was found to be false, the staff didn't make me aware until till 2mnths later of the issue. didn't feel comfortable,.. the best part tho was the team n the job its self was nice."
good,"enjoyed my time at Xerox, however, through all the trouble of training and on the floor time, not worth the pay that I received."
good,"Good atmosphere."
good,Worked mostly data entry. Management was not good at this location I was very dissatisfied working here.
good,"I really did enjoy working for Xerox, however being an indirect agent made the job more and more frustrating as the list of things that were ""allowed"" got shorter. They want you to take care of the customer, but limit your ability to do so."
good,I typical day at work for me is coming in to work to answer phone calls.We deal with upset client most of the day. I always know how to defuse the issues. I love answering the phone and taking calls. I work 2 different programs.
good,Love this place and what I was doing. Favoritism at it's worst.
good,"The overall work environment is ok with the exception of management.  I work in their customer service department and the job itself isn't hard (you just need to be a people person).  They promote advisors being one of their most important assets, but in reality we're not.   We're held to ridiculous aux queue adherences.  So much so that we are written up if we go to the bathroom unscheduled.  Many of the management staff there are unsupportive.  They have a STRICT cover their own butt mentality.  So, don't believe anything they say, that's personable.  We're given two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch.  which is good.  But, I was told by my supervisor to take a 10 minute break at one point, so as not to get written up.  We can't email outside of the work place, have pen or paper on our desks, or books for down time.  They have a ""clean desk"" sweep/check every day per shift.  If the manger doing the sweep deems your desk is ""dirty"", you can be written up for it.  The pay for the position is horrible.  Most customer service positions  start at 12/hr.  Theirs is 10 with a possibility of of getting 13/hr IF you're getting good reviews from customers.  Which is bogus, because it's based on whether or not the customer is happy.  But you could do everything right and still get a bad review, based upon the company's policies.  Needless to say, it's rare that anyone gets bonuses.  In any event, the bathrooms are semi clean and your co-workers (other advisors) are ok as well."
good,"The main focus at this job is to have short call times, not about truly helping their customers.  Having an amazing survey track record doesn't seem to show the higher ups that you are good at helping people."
good,"Enjoyed helping customers. Assist customers with billing questions, customer support, technical support."
good,"The job is easy, management is not good  and no order, co workers are friendly"
good,"A typical day at work is checking all the machines to see if they need anything before a call is placed. Also talking with customers to see if they have any concerns or issues with the machine that needs to be adressed."
good,"Customer service, customers wanting clarification on their bills,credits. Learned more about cell phones and requirements have them work properly. Management is alright could work on the ""10 commitments"" more they do not follow through on making agents prosper. Hardest part of the day is getting out of bed and going to work and customers want the impossible. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting the paycheck for all the long hrs we put it and wages need to improve"
good,"Working for this particular campaign was a struggle. The company does not pay much for the amount of work and stress that happens on a daily basis. The agents and the supervisors make the same amount of money but, the supervisor has triple the work to do. I mostly enjoyed the few people I met there. I learned that this job is only a stepping stone to sek other employment."
good,Not very organized. Should work on having things together and get better management.
good,I usually take about 50 chats a day. I answer customer questions pertaining to their order. Process order for customers. Provide overall 100% excellent  customer service to Lenovo customers.
good,"By far the most enjoyable part of this job was working for, and with Apple customers. Apple is a wonderful company, and Xerox allowed us to follow Apple's core beliefs. Apple's culture and values of truly appreciating there customers, and it showed in how many repeat customers I spoke with on a daily basis. This made my job a pleasure. I was allowed to take as much time as each individual customer needed, to ask questions, to find the specific product that would be best for them and, or answer any and all delivery questions. They allowed us as representatives to serve each customer as an individual treating each person, as I would want to be treated. I loved insuring each of their needs were met."
good,"inbound calls.  if you follow call metrics, show up early and work over, you'll keep your job."
good,Hardest part of job is trying to assist customer in fixing products while on the phone. Enjoy assisting customers in fixing issues that arrise. Co-workers are fun to work with. I have learned about managing calls to come to a resolution.
good,"Continual downsizing is a concern, but otherwise, great products, services and colleagues."
good,"I worked there for awhile in Yukon OK, just wasnt a place where you could move up quickly. The work place was dragging, the computers were outdated."
good,"The Hot Springs, AR facility works very much by ""who you know"""
good,Has been good for me and my family. The location is perfect.  There are not any opportunities for career growth.
good,"Taking calls, Being a team lead. Walking the floor to help other Agents. Filling out SR'S (service requests) for customers."
good,I learned how to navigate many computers systems at once.  Management was not good right after training was done then improved with new supervisor. Co-workers were easy to get along with. Sometimes the hardest part of the job was talking to the elderly.  What I liked most about the job was the early morning schedule and getting time off when asked for.
good,Transitioned from US Cellular to Xerox. The cultures are different. I believe with time it will be a better company.
good,"A typical day as a customer representative at Xerox starts off with you logging into your phone. You'll sign into your computer and bring up necessary programs to complete your job. Once it's time for you to start, you'll hit available on the phone and answer incoming calls from Verizon prepaid customers. You'll be setting up new accounts, going over terms and conditions, making suggestions for phones customers can purchase and plans available that will suit their needs, doing basic troubleshooting of their phones and accounts, and using your own personal judgement of whether or not an adjustment needs to be made to the account balance. This is done for majority of the day with two 10 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch."
good,"Summary says it best.  One of the ""talktracks"" states this - ""We optimize workflow to reduce operational expenditures and improve employee productivity and effficiency""  That is what they believe they promote, however they sure dont like to operate in the same manner they proclaim to provide to the customers. No organization, thus no commissions.   Also, over promising and under delivering is key here, not only to clients but to employees.  The cell phone, lap top and car dont make up for everything else they are lacking in, although, they think they are the only company who provides that to their employees."
good,"The best part of the position is that you can schedule your work and easily manage your time.  There is a calendar that shows the peaks and valleys of the workflow which makes it easy to manage your workload and schedule time off."
good,"Mostly you are used as temporary employee. Only a select few get to have a full time job.  I have worked there 4+ times and the last time I actually thought I was going to get to stay, but never assume anything especially with this company.  I would not recommend working there if you are looking for full time work."
good,"This was a great job i must say easy, fun, and nice to work for. I would have to say my only complaint is they made a huge deal over dress code. When i started i had just moved back so i had to buy all new clothes. upon being hired i was told the dress code was one thing then after i went a brought new clothes they told me oh no we have to change it. my point is money does not grow on trees and im not rich i dont have time or money to go buy new clothes when ever you feel what im wearing does not fit like it fits everyone else. I feel as long as i look professional then there should be no problem."
good,"As all large companies, Xerox has several management levels that may not be the best approach to what the client really needs."
good,"From the moment you're employed your job is never safe, very high turnover rate, absenteeism is high due to the stress level of the job. Risk of termination is extremely high for numerous reasons from the moment you are hired for training. "
good,"Speaking from my only self-experience with Xerox, it was a good job in itself. Most times I really enjoyed helping members. Agents were trained too quickly but did well for the most part. T,he next level administration (sups.; qa's, etc.) were some good; knowledgable and available. Others were power trippers; short on knowledge and unavailable. I did not llike being project based because there was no job security, no benefits, and constantly changing schedules really was disruptive."
good,Enjoyed my tenure at Xerox. My job was outsourced and i went to work for them. Getting to see both sides( as a customer too) I say my view was the grass being greener than I thought..they gave a lot but expected a lot in return.Was involved with hiring and other details periodically support staff doesn't experience. Day to day gven complete freedom to succeed or fail which my co-workers and i liked.Most Managers are virtual and ours only came out for meetings. Downside of being out of view was when cuts needed to be made it wasn't given a second thought i feel. Also had 4 bosses in 6 yrs so no real constants. In the end didn't want to leave but got re-married and relocated closer to family in another region.Xerox unfortunately couldn't find anything in my new area. Would I work for Xerox again? Yes its a good company still. But I have a less idealized view now.
good,Hardest part of the job is being treated like take it or leave it. Not very much opportunity for advancement.
good,"If you like Corporate America this is the job for you. Typical day logging into computer, writing reports, sending reports, getting last second requests to make more reports on. What I learned from Xerox is how to properly speak around employees without fearing to be reported to HR for something misunderstood. I also learned that in this environment that peers are very business oriented."
good,"This is a nice place to work if you really really need the income. What makes me not say a lot of good about this place is the constant changes. Management is always changing the standards and the rules. You can't really even plan much because your schedule is always changing. There is currently a pay freeze going on. Unless you work overtime, there is no increase in pay rate unless you advance. Advancement is hard, because you are constantly given the run around."
good,"The company was cool, but then started loosing clients and changed hours often. Typical day was making outbound calls to clients, patients with an outstanding medical bill attempted account resolution and customer service. Processed payments. My supervisor was ok most times. Hardest part were customer complaints and resolution of disputes. Most enjoyable was taking to different people in other states. Love customer service calls and a people person."
good,"In this company there is little room for growth or encouragement. Co-workers work very hard, but feel underappreciated. The hardest part of this job is working hard for a company that doesn't appreciate the effort you give it day in and day out."
good,"The management in the North Bend, OR. call center do not treat the representatives very well. It can be a hostile work environment. They were constantly making it harder to achieve any type of bonus. Not the best place to work."
good,Overall Xerox (working from home) is a decent job to have. The worst part is you can never make plans outside of your job because youo never had any idea what the hours will be day to day.
good,"I started out as a production assistant, and was promoted to Lead after only 2 weeks on the job. I was placed in a copy center in a major law frim with 7 associates reporting to me. As the supervisor was offsite and had 6 other law firms, I did all the payroll, bookeeping, inventory, project management, mentoring and training."
good,The Other Office was a nice place to start out. Got lots of experience in Print and Design work.
good,"Xerox was once a great company who has lost their way. They are outsourcing everything and laying people off every year. It's no longer matters the quality of work you do, but who you know and how you play company politics."
good,"Xerox is in the midst of redefining its brand from a purveyor of printing technologies to a technology innovator delivering intelligent workplace services. The strategy is sound and the technology is absolutely the best in the industry."
good,"- A focal point for internal and external customers"
good,"Used to be an excellent place to work, especially in the service dept."
good,Keep on firing so no job security. Salary hike is very less and not yearly once.. good learning about lean six sigma. No new project just work on same project that too not sure when u loose ur project
good,"Xerox was a good company to work for.  They were considerate of family life and prior obligations and would work around those type things, as long as you as the employee were willing to be flexible for them when necessary as well.  It didn't seem as though there was much room for advancement due to the fact that they often brought in management from other sites."
good,"You work here for the experience, the resume logo, and if you can negotiate, the comp. All other ""perks"" are virtually non-existent.  The better you perform, the more work they will place on you.  That said, if you are a hard worker, and a good performer, you don't have to worry too much."
good,"At Xerox (Now Conduent), the environment was one that was stressful. There was no comfortability and after being seated at a desk for hours and not being able to stand (simply because management forbid it) the employee often leaves physically strained. Management was promoted in small part ability based and even larger part popularity. There are some opportunities for employees to better themselves but they are not focused on. Very high turnover rate."
good,You have to work as a temp for up to a year before they offer you a permanent position. Most times you have to work 56 hours a week. Most employees are friendly and helpful.
good,Very busy call center with calls starting the moment they opened until the close of the business day. Management was partial to have favorites among the employees.
good,"I did enjoy my time at Xerox, and they gave me a great opportunity to learn before moving to the next step in my career.  While they were not able to give me the advancement opportunities I was looking for, they gave me the foundation I needed in order to do so elsewhere."
good,I work for Xerox for 12 years. I was the only person to cover several copiers. To much pressure for one person and poor management. They changed my managers 3 times. Job cut with no reason.
good,"Due to the digital transformation, xerox is going through a major downsizing of sales reps and overall staff.  To accept a role at xerox currently is to do so at your own risk.  You may be laid off regardless of what they tell you."
good,"The work schedule was flexible you were able to work and go to school. The staff work with you. The salary package was poor."
good,"Xerox used to be a great place to work.  Much has changed over the past five years, one being that people are constantly being asked to do much more with less and there is constant fear of losing your job.  Morale is very low especially as we continue to watch the addition of senior leaders who are paid very well which our salaries have increased insignificantly over the years."
good,"If getting yelled at for something you didn't do to a customer is your piece of pie, then Xerox is the place for you! You get to sit at a desk for 10+ hours and if you have to use the restroom, you have to use either one of your 15 minute breaks or your lunch break to go use the restroom."
good,"Greatest manager I ever have worked for. Poor management decisions forced massive layoffs when xerox stock plummeted to less that 3 dollars a share."
good,There is too much cost cutting taking place for organizations to be effective. Salary was below industry standards for position. It was once a great company to work for but it's just a shell of what it once was.
good,"It was an ok job but some things I didn't agree with like the pay being based on QA. Didn't like that you get points when you had sick days, couldn't take off on red days"
good,"Self paced with many layers of supervision. Lots of downsizing, Very formal culture. Limited training with on line being the most used. Lots of meetings with different layers of management."
good,"...but inside that crumbling building I had the opportunity to work with an amazing group of people that I learned so much from. After so many years, and long days and nights spent together, they became part of my family. Not a place for upward mobility or growth in a career sense, but I definitely benefited from the many years of experience my coworkers had and the knowledge they imparted on me."
good,Some departments are better than others. It is a good place to get your feet wet; not so good for more tenured people. Tenured employees are not appreciated.
good,"Xerox was a great place to work and gain experierence, however continued job cuts over the last 15 years have made it time to find a new opportunity.  Management needs to provide vision and guidance to guide new product development.  Engineering tends to push products to market in lieu of a formal Marketing/Market Research department guiding investment and technology commercialization."
good,"If you want to see what kind of character you're made of underneath, Xerox will bring it out. You'll be thrown in and expected to learn, which can be a good thing, but you'll also be saddled with more responsibilities than what you bargained for. You'll find out what your made of, and it's quite a an experience."
good,"Xerox is currently going through a period of significant change with little to no communication from Senior Management. It's a scary place to be when you have no idea where the organization will be in 6 months. "
good,"this is a large company where your successes and accomplishments will be rewarded to the upper management. Willing to promote you to more responsibility but not increase pay to match that new title. directly told that if you want the pay to match your current position you would have to leave Xerox and reapply to the job. "
good,"This place a lot of times gets a bad wrap, Some lines of business deserve it while others dont. If you come to work and do your job and are on time you wont have a problem here. "
good,"It was a job to have while seeking better opportunities. Xerox needed more structure within the workplace. The Compensation should be based on skills, the individual and education, rather everyone makes the same rate of pay."
good,"Over the years employees were asked to do much more with less support. It made it hard to keep up employee and even client satisfaction. With the new management and C Level changes, I hope to see the company grow back into the company it can and has been."
good,Tuve una buena experiencia trabajando en xerox hasta que la empresa fue vendida a Conduent.
good,"A typical day at work is standard get your work done at all costs, then go home.  Rinse repeat everyday.  Miss my team, but not the corporation or their politics."
good,"Typical call center culture. Monitoring. Goals. Polite assistance for customers on plans, pricing. For the Verizon phone service. By the Xerox parent company."
good,"Micro managed, heavy work loads and deadlines, poor lighting, noisy, disgruntled management. lack of integrity toward customers"
good,Xerox was a great place to work when I first started. Once the competition took over most of the customers it became a very cut throat place to work. I learned how to work on the smallest to the largest pieces of equipment including software. Management felt the stress which carried over to the technicians making it unpleasant to work there in the last couple years.
good,"This was the hardest job I had experienced. Yet it would seem easy but  it felt like working as a slave I was not okay with that especially while pregnant. The worst part was  I had to wait  to use the  bathroom. As a pregnant female and those who have been pregnant we know when nature is knocking, we don't have a choice  but to be prepared for her to bust through the door. Also having customers yell at me  on the phone  with my hormones constantly lead me into medical stress issues working and I had to quit."
good,The management always find ways to keep us alive while working by providing extra bonuses and games. They also set up televisions for us to watch while working to lessen stress at work.
good,"The job was stressful, but the pay was achievement based, so I could make more than fellow employees as long as I was efficient at the job, so it balanced that part out. The management could use some help"
good,"It's an okay job. call center environment, seeking different employment for more pay.you have an 30 min lunches, and 2 15 min breaks. answering calls from pharmacist doctors and also customers."
good,A typical day at Xerox was filled with emotion. Stress that you don't need. The entire time I was working at this place I hated it. There is no such thing as professionalism at this place.
good,If you enjoy working with staff who is young and petty this place is for you. You will also be offered days off with pay that you will never get to enjoy. Please do not have real life experiences because management will not care and you will most likely be terminated
good,"Working Hours 9.05am - 5.30pm. Very strict in terms of KPI & Target reaching. Long hour of working as we need to reach our target otherwise it will affect our KPI and Performance bonus. Hardest - Long Hour works. Inexperienced team leader."
good,"Xerox was a good company, there were times when it was stressful open enrollment opened for Medicare I'm different types of insurance how to be very knowledgeable about insurances"
good,It was a good job. It took a lot of time and there was a lot of overtime to be worked. I couldn't always work the OT but it was mandatory to work it. I missed a funeral one time. But all in all it was a good place to work. Be careful what friends you make though. Some of them will take advantage of you.
good,"If you can work in the noise created by the unprofessional people they hire, you'll do great. They have some good managers that really look out for their people. With any call center you have to be willing to take an account you may not particularly like but it is a pay check."
good,Working with Xerox was very stressful. The environment was difficult to handle at times. I worked in a call center and the clients was Medicare and many was elderly people. Many agents was very rude over the phone many hung up. I took every call with a professional
good,"Empresa que promove a rotatividade de funções, e que aposta bastante na formação dos seus colaboradores, especialmente em cargos técnicos e de middle management. Assim, a promoção vertical em termos de funções é bastante fomentada e possível, sendo o meu caso um exemplo prático disso mesmo (encontro-me na empresa há cerca de cinco anos, tendo desempenhado quatro funções distintas ao longo desse tempo). No entanto, essas mesmas promoções não são reflectidas em aumentos salariais que vão de acordo com as responsabilidades dos novos cargos assumidos, mas sim num valor máximo em comparação ao cargo anterior que o funcionário desempenhou, aumento esse que quase nunca ultrapassa os dez por cento do salário bruto anterior. Este processo faz com que os valores pagos em certos cargos sejam bastante abaixo do praticado por outras empresas, o que acaba por motivar a procura de oportunidades fora da empresa."
good,The training was in depth and exciting but the real life execution was tricky. Balancing customer service with what you are actually able to do to fix an issue is not always easy. Managers were not always available to help with questions and that was probably the most frustrating part of the job. You do rely heavily on your team. If you have a strong team then they make everything worth while.
good,"Working at Xerox could be stressful as you have daily, weekly and monthly numbers to meet, but if you were able to meet the job standards meeting the numbers were fairly easy."
good,"I loved the job. The management just does not care because of the high turn over rate so they are rude and blunt all the time. The training is adequate from the company and some of the trainers are awesome but they give you a false sense of what the job requirements are and once you are on the main call floor the management staff is a total 180 from training. Unfriendly, uncaring, rude, and blunt. I actually had an issue with of the training managers during a call i was on. It was very embarrassing."
good,"No raises for almost 7 years, poor working conditions....floors have not been vacuumed/shampooed in over 5 years, no cafeteria, no workout facilities."
good,Answered phone calls for customers that had questions and issues with their apple devices. I was doing tech support for this company and was extremely under paid.
good,"XEROX US seems GOOD"
good,"Manque d'hygiène, nettoyage pas fait tout les jours"
good,"The division was in a downward spiral and had been for past 5 years; it was closed.  Management did not want to make needed improvements to system to current day standards, moving opportunities through pipeline required multiple conference calls."
good,I worked the afternoon shift which at the time was conducive to m schedule. y training lasted 6 weeks. The training made it easy to learn the ever changing information. A typical work day including be on the phone with customers along with an half hour lunch break.
good,our work was based on the working loads from onshore. if no work available then we don't have a task. salary was based on the output and grade. the more work loads you've done the bigger the salary.
good,"Typical day at work with Xerox was quite a bit of walking and escorting repairmen on site for the printers in any weather. "
good,"* it's secure environment but not much learning ."
good,"job not secure, hours are good usually from 9 to 5. As a contractor you get no benefits and no job security. Also the pay is not great at all. good place to gain some experience"
good,It was ok.  They separated their BPO and now its Conduent.  The culture is lacking.  The teams are at each other and very few people are happy.  A lot of people have left the organization.
good,"Its not necessarily the best environment, the people are not the best to work with thats where being a team players comes in well. Its not a difficult job its the the management team making it difficult."
good,A typical day consist of being on the phone for an average of 8-20  minutes though some calls can go on for an hour or so. The number of calls depends on the day it is and what project you may be working on. A majority of the managing staff are young and barely building their own experience so depending on the person there might be a lack of communication.
good,"The hours are great, but the job security and room for advancement needs improvement. Okay place to work, just don't like a contracted position. Training needs improvement."
good,"Managerial support and philosophies make it difficult to truly impact the environment. With recent acquisition of the Xerox by Conduent, we have seen improvements (environment and wages) however, the culture that exists will take some time before we see substantial change in this regard. Ideally we want to create an environment where people want to stay and develop their skills and one where workers feel they are valued. This is a process without a doubt, meanwhile we are losing some very good people to our competitors as our attrition rates are above industry standards."
good,The changing work schedule is the only negative experience I've had. It does guarantee job placement security. The pay grade could improve drastically based on the minimum requirements alone.
good,"The pay is good once you are there past probationary period. 4 days on, 4 off, but 12 hour shifts. Management is lacking, very ""hands off."" Not a bad place to work, but not great."
good,I enjoy working with my peers at Xerox.  Hard working and a desire to be collaborative.  Xerox management provided training opportunities when possible and supported those willing to learn.
good,"Xerox pays on an ABC rate..begins with base pay $12.45 per hr and the more calls you take, the more money you make.  This job is more for college students, living at home, with no major responsibilities, monthly obligations."
good,"Many people work in the same place. Not sure if its the same when i was working there, but we didnt really have alot of help once getting on the floor on our own."
good,Getting the opportunity to do field engineering for some of the top technology companies and Fortune 500 companies was definitely a plus. Going to different sites and meeting new people and viewing the latest technology and computer art was amazing and fulfilling experience.
good,Working at Xerox (who changed to Conduent) is like working at any other call center. Fast paced and non stop calls. We are contracted through the state to assist with people's benefits.
good,Xerox gave me the opportunity to really cut my teeth. I learned to master the basics and build great relationships with my clients. Fantastic training program.
good,process applications for Medicaid. Management constantly changing rules and procedures. Open enrollment brings in a lot of employees and most of them are then released in the spring.
good,"Very complicating role, must be patient, I learned to have more self management at this job, but very frustrating but overall I got through it day by day!"
good,This company had poor training that left me completely unprepared for the job. Surveys for the customer to answer about there experience were basically your job review.
good,"Busy call center. Most days are back to back calls. Immediate management work with you to help you do the best at your job. Many procedure changes over last few years, some helpful and others not so helpful. Great part is no sales but hard part is difficult customers."
good,"the job was simple , however the management made some situations a bit difficult. They were very unprofessional and childish at times. Besides management the job was enjoyable"
good,"a company where suits and boots don't mix "
good,Culture changed and company was no longer a good work life balance and benefits decreased over time.  No raises for years on end which hurt morale the company moved majority of jobs to Guatemala
good,"Enjoyed assisting members who needed help to track online order from Sams club. Also , helping with online accounts if password or email needed to be updated ."
good,"Fast Paced, every man for themselves type of environment. Worked with great people, would not return if offered another position with that particular contract or management group."
good,"Xerox, now known as Conduent, has offered us former employees of the Greeley site that closed March 31, 2017 one job as a tech support person for a large client, the contract timeframe for whom is unknown."
good,"While employed at this company, the management was erratic and advancement was impossible unless one knew the correct people.  Benefits were for full timers and the life balance to this position causes one to forfeit their social life.  A great position for loners."
good,Way to many different systems to log into and out off each day. Could never check on employee benefit without having to reset my password to the HUB first.
good,"The company is a good place to work if you don't mind being busy and working at a fast pace.  The people there are very friendly and helpful.  Unfortunately training is very limited and you are basically thrown into a position, shown the basics and left to your own avail."
good,"WHile the in-class training starts off well, things got a bit high school attitude when training bay came about. There was too much personal business going around and the management wasn't stable when I was there,"
good,There was lots to learn as the job was totally new to me.  Training was incomplete which made life very frustrating. Everyone in my team kept to themselves.
good,From my time working for Xerox I would say one of the most enjoyable parts about the job would be the education aspect of the call center and health insurance. I was able to learn so much about call center metrics/call center management which assisted me in my work as a Supervisor leading a team of associates.
good,"I enjoyed working there. it was stressful at times like any job but we were a team. the people there are very helpful and seem to really care about you as a person and not only as an employee,"
good,"When going for an interview ask if there is advancement if they tell you yes they are lying, especially if you are going through an agency, if you get hired directly that is a different story. Only work for them directly especially if you want a competitive salary and advancements."
good,"Work was easy, however supervisors were of no help when issues came up.  The management team were very young and had no experience with supervising a team."
good,"Only good for the money, it was from home which is nice but the team I worked for didn't really work together nor did anyone value each other's opinions or input."
good,xerox will hire anybody. it was a okay job I cant complain to much. it needs to be more professional. supervisors have there favorites. I would recommend this job to early in age adults.
good,Learned many skills including how to deescalate angry customers.  Very busy call center; i answered an average of 60 calls per day.  I assisted Verizon Wireless customers.
good,"Working for Xerox, I gave my all. I served them for 18 years and they laid me off. Unexpectedly I was laid off. Received a phone call on a Monday not to return back to work I was part of a IRIF. I loved my job at the VA Hospital for Xerox and I always did my best."
good,"Xerox has been slow to react to changing markets. Its previous attempts at change have not proven successful and it's now banking on mining existing, but shrinking, market segments it previous ignored."
good,"the company is good and good benefites. the supervisor could be a lot better. they have good benefits. time off is good and vac. time. They lack communication it very poor, which is not the company it is the leader ship,"
good,"okay work place it was not professional and my co workers did not take their jobs seriously, it made it a lot harder for me and other co workers to do their jobs."
good,Management could be better because they change your schedules w/o getting your permission first. Should get more pay for the job task as other companies do. Call center environment.
good,Xerox is a great company to start at. It is a great place out of college. It is a great working experience and gets you comfortable and confident speaking with C level contacts.
good,Great co-workers but poor management.Sometimes employees were not informed of changes that they were going to be affected.
good,Most campaigns are easy to catch on to but the management could be better. I love all the overtime that becomes available as well.
good,Great starting point for your career. Diligence pays off. Shift position. Computer experience is necessary. Very busy in the winter while slower in the summer.
good,"Great Entry level position for call center experience. Decent building with a great view of the mountains close by. Easy to find, and easy to apply for."
good,"Lacking organizational structure, No control over work delegations, multiple managers, however every one united with a spirit to prove them selves & progress, team spirit was good"
good,job not secure. there was a layoff because of contract loss with sprint. but overall fun helping customers with technical issues. typical work day involved with customer tech problems billing ect.
good,"Too many changes with very little notice for employer to make changes to their personal life, such as daycare arrangements. The company is  no longer Xerox it is Conduit."
good,Most enjoyable part of my job are the people I have working for me and some of those I work with around me. I supervise the call center but also had 3 other little departments under me at one point as well. Call center can be very busy at times while others we are able to get other duties completed. There is always something to do.
good,This type of environment was very stressful. The incentives were good but it could not make up for the stressful shift changing environment it came with.
good,"This job over works you and under pays you. The management needs training on how to treat others and be professional. There is no confidentiality or respect. It's like going to a jail everyday. You can not do anything, they suck the fun out of everyone. It's like a high school work environment. Not a career place"
good,They arent really flexiablw whwb it comes to schdules espcially if your stuck in the hospital giving birth. Got to meet a lot of people and it was good place to work just needa better managers.
good,Friendly place. But I dont like working at call centers overall. Dress code should be as comfortable as possible. We are sitting in front of a computer for more than eight hours.
good,"Overall, Xerox is not a bad place to work. One of the biggest benefits is that you can work from home, saving a great deal of money on commuting, among other things. You also get paid-training, and get to be a part of a team generally filled with interesting individuals from all over the United States. Work is fast-paced, and there is never a dull moment."
good,Great first job for young people just out of school. Even good for somone who is retiered and needs to subsidise a little income. But not worth trying to maintain a career. Nor is it worth making it a primary source of income to support a family. The management can be hostile at times and your nothing but a number to them.
good,"clock in bring up computer and various windows for job the answer phones and verify insurance information (most enjoyable part).  management was aloof and did not really understand your job only knew how to run a call center, coworkers were hard to get along with and had their own agenda (worst part). learned how to verify insurance."
good,Working at Xerox taught me a lot about customer service. It showed me patience and how to empathize with the members. It's a great place of employment
good,"Worked under an At Will contract, which means you can be released at any time, for any reason. High employee turn over level. High stress as polocies/procedures change on daily basis."
good,Es stören die Arbeitszeiten und die späte Einteilung der schichten.  Der Druck wurde extrem angehoben.  HABE freiwillig aufgehört  !!
good,"The people are great, management not so much, They did not submit time worked in a timely manner so I quit. But I did learn a lot about customer svc, O"
good,Xerox is a nice job and the work environment makes is much better. There are no complaints about this job except that is doesn't give you to advance also they require you to take more training and get skill for the exact same pay. I have been entry level at this job for almost 2 years.
good,"Xerox was easy to work for; however, the work flow varied too much so I was constantly out of work until they finally laid me off for good."
good,"Used to be one of the top companies, leadership was poor at best and most reps would rather flip equipment then look for new accounts.  Flavor of the month on selling ideas."
good,El ambiente laboral es dependiendo de como te lleves con tus companeros. El supervisor de mi area se creia mucho y no habia apoyo al equipo. Habia preferencias y ademas no hay oportunidad de crecimiento a corto plazo.La cafeteria un asco. El salario esta mas o menos
good,"Xerox is always changing something. whether it be technology or staffing. Co-workers are great, both onshore and offshore. Yearly furlows. Management tends to RIF project team players at the worst possible time."
good,"awesome company. love the travel get to go places I would never to able to go. Love my co workers, manager and clients. nothing hard about the job at all. Fun, fulfilling work."
good,"I was happy to be involved with Xerox, however management change and 3PO threats to break down an already weak union was a turning point. Sorry Xerox, but not for me, life is way better now that I have left.. :)"
good,"If I had a choice, I wouldn't have touched this company with a two foot pole. As of 2016, the company is hemorrhaging money, and field service technicians are being grilled for any possible performance metric that the company can come up with."
good,"Many talented people, currently a company in flux as a result of uncoupling with Xerox Tech.  Looking forward to seeing the new and and improved company."
good,I had worked at a call center previously and was not in the right mind set to continue.  I did not feel that the trainer knew the information well enough to be training others.
good,Its a great starting job. Loved the environment. I do not like how I was treated. I did great at what I did and they still threw me away like I was nothing. Like I didn't mean anything to them.
good,The turnover rate is pretty high so your always seeing new people coming in from new training classes. The rules are always subject to change. The bonus your supposed to get from referring someone and they stay for over 3 mos does not go directly on your check you have to constantly remind HR. However if your looking for a constant check you do get paid every two weeks.
good,A decent entry level call center environment yet I quickly found other opportunities of higher pay which also offered far more opportunities for advancement
good,"Decent company to work for."
good,"If you can handle people calling in and constantly complaining to you, you will do fine. Take an average 30 calls a day helping people out. I have learned many skills on how to deescalate situations and how to help a costumer out when they are in need. Also, I have been able to clarify questions on their account and get them to understand what has happened."
good,"Xerox is an okay place to work, you are able to advance within this company."
good,"Back to back interactions with customers in regards to their accounts. I've learned to assist with plan changes, equipment orders, questions or concerns about billing and payments, general information about products or promotions. Management is very helpful, and always around to answer any questions I may have, and anytime we make a mistake they coach you so that you learn and improve your performance. The job can be very hectic and stressful due to most of the time the customer is calling because something is wrong on their account. I enjoy being able to customize and resolve peoples issues and also the scheduling and pay is very convenient."
good,I learned a lot about the call center. The hardest part of the job is not feeling appreciated and also waiting years before getting a raise. I didn't like the fact that the agents on the phone made more money than leadership. I didn't like the fact that when they laid off some people there wasn't any type of warning in one day and out the next. The best part about my job was being able to help.
good,"Everyday we started by sitting at a computer and waiting for customers to call and ask us to fix their issues. When I first arrived, i was excited to learn a new trade and ready to put my mind to it. I loved the idea of supporting people in the need of help, and being able to assist them. However, we were not properly trained in doing so. The management failed at assisting us to do our job better. My co-workers didn't seem enthused to be there and almost every day I heard an employee either quit, or get irate and get fired. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to fix an issue even without the right training. I loved to hear a customer thank me in relief. Made the job worth it in the end. I guess the worst part was not knowing how to fix the other issues due to lack of knowledge and training."
good,"If you have thick skin and realize that you arent actually technical support but are customer service, you will do fine. Training seems like its gearing you up well, but it doesn't actually. No two people have the same information, even though we go by articles. Working from home is nice. The attendance policy sucks."
good,"Providing administrative support to business operations by performing processing tasks such as pulling files, scanning, mail sorting and ensuring accuracy and completeness of the processed work. As well as performing broad data entry of materials from source documents to a computer database."
good,they have this training that if you don't pass their test you don't get there job. alot of pressure on the position but you do learn alot in a short time.
good,"Xerox was an ""okay"" place to work, however assignments were constantly changing, and once one was up, hours were cut or you were let go."
good,The co-workers are great but the sr management team does not do a god job of ensuring their teams have the tools and resources they need.
good,No room to grow..attendance policy changes every month..cut your hours...it has the potential to be a good company if the ceo listened to employees
good,Micro managed but I learned a lot by force. If y ou like talking to clients and researching this is a god job for you. I need more pay I have a lot of responsibilities.
good,"Poorly managed, hires the most ghetto people. Girls dress like they are going to the club. Lots of ""kids"" here. Everyone sleeps around."
good,its decent job. it has a high turn over rate and very easy to loose your job if your not good at what they require you to do. the will hire anybody
good,"I find Xerox to be a place of high turn overs and low consideration for employee satisfaction. Yes we are here to work and provide our skills through our job duties however, better practices need could be employed to make the work life experience much more palatable."
good,"The actual work at the job was quite rewarding; primarily involved fixing a variety of hardware and software issues for remote servers.  The overall feeling was that management did not care about anyone below, so it was a very cog-like atmosphere."
good,"Just like any job it has it's ups and downs. I've had great management throughout the years which have made my experience great. However, as a company as a whole it has made it difficult at times to enjoy the environment."
good,The only time you really hear from management was for the negatives. What we were doing wrong never what we did right. Never felt like a member of a team. Asking assistance from a co-worker was discouraged.
good,"A typical day would be to arrive, check emails briefly for any new notifications about new tickets or procedures. Then onto the phones for the next 9 hours, with an hour lunch and 2 15 minute breaks. "
good,"Des journées de travail longues, fastidieuses et parfois intenses, peu de temps de pause, salaire vraiment pas à la hauteur des efforts donnés, informations données aux salariés au compte-goutes..."
good,"Very productive work place with a few relaxing moments. Most supervisors look out for their agents and make sure they get the help the need on learning the systems, rules, and helping them move up in the work place. I learned how to be patient when dealing with customers who have a harder time grasping on technical things and learned how to deescalate an upset customer. My co-workers are amazing without them I wouldn't be able to make it most days. The hardest part of the job is trying to move up in positions when you are meeting all the requirements, but never seem to be noticed by upper management. I can say the most enjoyable part of the job is talking to the rare customers who understand that you are trying your best from over the phone and the connections you build with your team as well."
good,I wouldn't work for Xerox again but overall the experience was what I expected.I advanced into management pretty quickly and trained others to achieve management positions. Customer Service for cellphones and technical issues was my line of expertise at this establishment.
good,"Company really never offerd any type of employment compensation or bonuses for a job well done,no incentives.Management could have been better, you rarely had any type of personal imput to make the job better for everyone."
good,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to go to Xerox in Madison, MS. The job is no secure or at least in 2012 when I was there it wasn't. Things go change with time, I hope this job is one of the change over time."
good,"whati did in this job was receive incoming calls from cell phone holders who needed help with understanding the bill, to changing esn numbers, to ordering refurbished phones, and activating new lines of service and upgrading there plans or lowering there plans"
good,"Fast paced work environment, flexible hours and pay rate. Diverse atmosphere,the best part about working here is the ability to learn multiple task and make the pay rate you desire."
good,"But except fun - No growth, No learning, No fair decisions towards hardworking employees."
good,"Not helpful when you need them, and you can't get no one in management to help you fight for what's right when it comes to survey's that customer's would fair you for reason you had no control over."
good,"Co- workers were great, environment was great. The benefits were decent. The job was not hard at all. Fort the most part it was a great place to work in."
good,Job Security was in question - too much turnover.  Overall enjoyed the people I directly worked with in the PMO.  High level of trust within group
good,"-I use to work 8 hours a day ,my job is about ingesting old tapes and record it to have a digital file ."
good,Great co-workers whom I enjoy working with everyday.  Working with peers whom you enjoy seeing each day makes the flow of work much more enjoyable and productive.
good,"De werkdag begint met het inloggen/ opstarten van de nodige programma's. Eenmaal in de lijn sta ja klanten te woord en beantwoord hun vragen zo goed mogelijk. Afhankelijk van het aantal bellers op de dag zelf krijg je meer of minder klanten te spreken."
good,"Fast paced environment with little training. Co-workers were supportive when time permitted. Day consisted of answering benefit questions from client, meetings, vendor relations and projects."
good,Xerox is a productive and fast-paced work environment. I have learned how to provide world class customer service to individuals that call the center.
good,"Typically I'm on the road early checking emails and of to my first call, going through all my check points in order to resolve problems or going to warehouse to pick up parts for down machine."
good,so i worked for them for a year and had to resign because i needed a leave of absence do to a medical issue with my father and needed to travel out of state  and they wouldn't grant it now my immediate supervisor was amazing and he was great however there is the issue of  how the do thing so in the first 5 week you are trained to handle and do your job when the training is over you realize the 98% of the engagement do not adhere to the proper procedures in fact i had an operations manager tell me i was not aloud to yous a statement like sir i need you to stay professional on this call and not use foul langue towards me witch is what your taught to say when it happens to you and is approved by corporate to be said and when i informed her of this she then said how much of what u learned in training actual helps you in your job to which i replied everything and her response was to laugh and tell me i was mistaken  on top of that  now that i have left there with proper notice on several occasions have not verified my employment in a resemble amount of time last time a company tired to verify my employment it took them 7 weeks to do so and they had already started the training class and filled all positions and it is sad because over all it is a good job minus all the issues with upper management not following the guidelines and noting being done about it
good,I worked too many hours and just had more and more work put on my plate. The dept I worked in had not seen raises for over 5 years.
good,"I love the people that I work with, however, it would behoove upper management to discuss the reconstruction of office culture because there is none."
good,"I would have liked the job more if there was room for advancement. Also, if the company from management on down to the leads were more organized and into the workers that are dedicated to the company."
good,"I really love this job, its just too much and not enough pay. Team Leaders don't know as much as the customer Service Rep. Like highscool all over again."
good,Not the same company it once was. Behaves like all large global companies. All about cost cutting. No growth opportunities. Sales driven.
good,I am not very happy about working here but I learn from experience the management team is not very productive they have open door policy well I have gotten nowhere with that.
good,"answering incoming calls from pharmacies, dr. offices, or members concerning medication coverage. Whether medication was formulary and if it had restrictions. Depending on caller I would either give information about drug, offer to prescribers office reps, member to our clinical team to issue pa or set case. If pharmacy calling in and if medication was a Medicare b vs. d request I could issue prior authorization override so member could receive medication. I learned a lot about the different medication types and their restrictions."
good,Xerox is easy to get a job with and they do give nice bonuses which are not that easy to earn to the best people get the best pay
good,"Dinâmico"
good,not to bad.dont feel very appricated honestly.i work there bcs i like my customers.but it gets old after a while.the benifits arnt great and they dont really care about family.they are very much about the money.
good,"It was a pretty good job. We answerd 90 to 100 calls per day and some call you didnt know what to expect, but overall not a bad place to work but im looking for something more professional."
good,Aangename werkplaats voor zowel werkgevers en werknemers
good,Coming from another large corporation over to Xerox what quite a change in environment. The building felt more like a prison than an actual workplace. It is more of a clock in and clock out type of job.
good,I answer phone calls and assisted the people of Kentucky with applying for healthcare coverage.
good,"A great place for students, who are looking for temporary work."
good,"Foi bom trabalhar para adquirir experiência em relacionamento, mas não era registrada, também foi combinado limpar local de trabalho, mas o patrão pedia para limpar a casa e quintal da filha, foi desanimano..."
good,"working for xerox had its pros and cons... they worked with me with my scedule , however the pay is not nearly enough for all that we do"
good,I loved the work place and the type of work I was doing but I felt that the work that was expected to be done was deserving of the compensation that was given.
good,"Making friends at your workplace is always the best! Once you've encountered a friend, work becomes much more enjoyable!"
good,"Bon équilibre entre vie professionnelle et personnelle. Aucun travail les fins de semaines et en soirs de semaine. L'horaire de travail est flexible. Les tâches sont variés mais manque d'opportunité à de l'avancement professionnel. Travail en équipe occassionnel."
good,Xerox is a company with a wide varity of products. The product that I sold for the company was called Docushare. I help launch the product. The product did very well. The company had different Trade Shows that I was apart of. Enjoyed every bit of it.
good,"Companies going through change get mislabeled.  Xerox at this location is the fourth organization for the same line of business, and change is the name of the game."
good,"- Gestion du parc d'imprimantes Xerox (1500 machines sur 140 sites)."
good,"Learned how to use a dial system and software for a major phone company, positioning techniques and billing situations. Normal day of work was to sit and take as many calls as possible. Handling a lot of different requests from billing to activations to explaining plans. Supervisors were helpful and knowledgeable. They coached you on way to improve time and aptitude on calls. "
good,"Job is repetitive and boring which makes for a long day."
good,Engineering is being phased out.  Management does try to balance work and home life.
good,"My time at this office was ok. My career didn't thrive as I thought it would. No raises, no appreciation for its employees. My expectations were high at first since its a multi-billion dollar company but they failed to meet expectations. Even requesting the simplest of supplies was like pulling a tooth from a kid. Management was messy and unprofessional at times. Rules were bent for co workers that were close to management. I learned to have patience with both clients and co workers. I enjoyed the group I worked with but this office could have been managed significantly better."
good,The people of this location were very plesant and made the workday more enjoyable.
good,The people were great.. There was a true family environment attemted here. The problem was that in the position they continued to add more reponsibility and not compensate as such.
good,"• un día típico en el trabajo: Una vez que te adecuas a las operaciones diarias, te relajas mucho por lo que tienes la oportunidad de realizar actividades de carácter personal como, escuchar música, consultar redes sociales, leer, estudiar."
good,"Hours varied from 7am til 7pm"
good,"- Okay place to work, wages could be higher. Other than that it is what you make of it."
good,"High energy, with allot of client interaction.  I completed multiple on-line required courses that enhanced my skill level.  Since I worked as a subcontractor, co-worker relationships were not a important or necessary.  Relationships with the end users allowed for confidence in the company as well as myself."
good,"Many challenges to embrace and sharpen your skills on.  New and diverse experiences each day, chances for creativity and clever solutions abound.  Chance to work with a variety of customers and requirements."
good,"Took a average of 60-80 calls from customers in a 8 hour shift, about 80% of the time billing questions , helped them to make sure they had the right plan and price they were paying. Upgrades for plans or equipment included sales of new or used cell phones / accessories. Process credits up to 30.00 or 25% of their overages , however I would try to fix the reason why they were going over , going over self serve options as far as how to check their useage as far as mins.text & data so they would not go overages that at times from 10-20.00 to 1000.00."
good,"Out Sourcing company handles thousands of clients around the world. Very friendly work enviorment viery diversal in culture, "
good,"Muy buenos compañeros de trabajo."
good,getting at work and having to get right on the phones i did not really care for. i liked it more when we had a team meeting first. on going education was great. their policy on absences i did not like. i was in a car accident do to ice on the road and had to be bed ridden for a week and i got wrote up for it.
good,"The people are great to work with. They claim there is potential for advancement, but there isn't. It's a great job to get customer service experience, but nothing more."
good,"This is a great place to work if you like gossip and drama because thats the type of people who work there. Although people get their jobs done, Im just not into the gossip. Overall if your all about work and making money,then this is the perfect job for you."
good,I handled 45-60 cases per day. Reviewing financial information as well as household composition to determine what health care plan the family was eligible for. Also paying attention to details provide by customer about their home environment.
good,"Typical day at work is logging onto my computer before my shift begins. Log into my phone to wait for calls to come in, then listen to what the customer would like to know about our credit cards or where they can be directed to concerning their account. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that are very unhappy and having to sit there and let them vent their frustrations to you. The most enjoyable part of the job is when my call ends with the customer being satisfied with my assistance to complete their phone call."
good,"a typical day, arrive 15 minutes early get breakfast in expensive cafeteria,  log into my phone and computer, and take inbound calls from employees with questions about their billing, benefits, explain policies and procedures and processes, enroll and disenroll, take cobra calls, flexible spending account calls, and explain life, medical, dental vision, and medicare to both active and retirees"
good,"•	Reset Active Directory password (Citrix), WDE passwords and Lotus Notes "
good,"Was once one of the top 100 companies to work for."
good,"When working for Xerox, there are no opportunities to advance in the position that you are working in and they do not want to give you a raise.  Once you reach the call center floor and begin work, you will be raised to a certain salary past training and then you are topped out on your salary with no potential to obtain a raise."
good,"answer inbound calls, data entry and taking payments, management was good coworkers were great hardest part of the job was the schedule and that we cant work around it you basically get stuck with whatever you get most enjoyable was the experience and working with customers from all over the u.s"
good,"the work was challenging because i had to deal with more than 50 people a day. the job taught a lot with regards to managing people and with my problem solving skills and my interpersonal skills."
good,"Typically at the workplace you deal with cellular issues for customers from around the U.S. Basically a Over-The-Phone job. You are taught positioning skills and how to build report with your customers to make the call a bit less stressful on both parties. The Management is not very great as the Supervisors, On-sight Managers, and The Head of the center do not seem to have the best of communication. Mingling between co-workers has always been a nice relief from the calls on the breaks and lunch provided. Typically everyone who has worked there was quite delightful and very nice. The Hardest Part of the job would have been the escalations and managing tickets. Trouble tickets are one of our most common calls and it can be stressful on the customer. The most enjoyable part about the job I would say is the people you meet over the fun. They can be fairly nice and spontaneous. Trust me :]"
good,"While working in the ""office"" it truly was a ""grind"" with days running in to days.  Once I was trusted to become Home Based I enjoyed the team work with other agents and my manager and felt I was succeeding in reaching my own goals but the schedules, routines and uncertainty with my bosses and the program made me anxious.  I realized that this was all new and a pilot program for Xerox and so my own position was tenuous and expectations became unreasonable as the fears of my managers began to affect me.  Its a good job to learn call center work with excellent training  and the product, Apple is superior. The managers and supervisors are new and are ""OJT"" and that's not superior. My own manager is a great person but under incredible stress to perform.  The stress at times was almost unbearable.  I work well under pressure but uncertainty is not a good thing.  I liked working as home based agent and with the team and my customers."
good,"I like the work enviornment it's very mellow. I learned a lot of ways on how to keep a calm attitude when dealing with frustrated customers. And how to handle and keep my personal business out of work. My co-workers loved me! I am a very upbeat and joyful person! I'm fun and always alive when I'm at work. The hardest part of the job was trying to handle a situation that you had forgotten how to handle during training. Overall I did love working for Xerox, I thought it was a wonderful opportunity to have that experience there."
good,"Xerox it self is a good company. They agency that hired me on the other hand isn't what I expected. Bad commutation, procrastination and not able to be honest."
good,its a good company to work for. the people are nice. you do alot of drilling shrinking wraping running black and color printers
good,I did not enjoy working for this company there was little to no structure and th hours changed constantly.
good,"In this position I demonstrate confidence, managing customer accounts, maximizing time with each customer on each call providing excellent customer service resolving issues with customers accounts, placing and shipping orders, as well as meeting quotas designated by company standards and following company policy."
good,"While the company offered a very challaging work enviroment, the rewards were not there."
good,"A typical day at work with an over abundance of callers calling in to shout at you, it was my job to turn angry grizzly bears into gummy bears. 19 out of 20 times, I did it successfully. Management - Still in training / needed additional training (loved my managers). Co-workers were alright. Befriended a few and learned which ones to steer clear of. Hardest part of the job, telling the customer bad news. (For instance, when they have a card stolen and every last penny was spent off the card.) Most rewarding part of the job, changing the customers mood from irate / super emotional to happy and confident,"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of various responsibilities that changed daily. "
good,Xerox us a nice place to work.  It offers benefits and try to maintain a good work / life balance
good,"Basically, it's a calling center for a solitary client. It's phone and email. I didn't learn much new that I hadn't learned in my pervious calling center job."
good,"While under FMLA and struggling to make ends meet I was terminated."
good,"I begin each day by logging into multiple systems such as Citrix, TOPS, CARES, and Webstation.  I then use telephony or smartphone to answer inbound calls from US Cellular customers.  Sometimes the hardest part of the job is when all your systems may not work simultaneously, but the most enjoyable part are the people.  Most of the management are nice and try to work on your behalf,"
good,Good palce to work. Interact with employees and manager to acheive business resulds. Enjoyed the people and work processes.
good,The other CSR are nice and the supervisors are approachable.
good,A project-based job which offerend me the opportunity to develop the ability to negociate.
good,I enjoyed the work and the idea of the program.  It helped a lot of people get insurance and as a mom I understand how that can be rough not having insurance for your kids.  The toughest part of the job was working on a new process that involved so many moving parts.  Xerox had not real say in the operations as the function belonged to the State Department of Social Services.  This led to a lot of initial confusion in the beginning.  I like a lot of the people I worked with and the staff was committed.  I did find it odd that things like recycling were not being encouraged by such a large company in Connecticut.  There were also a lot of uncertainty due to the fact that my job was based on contract work. 
good,"This is not a place that I would really recommend to people, if your looking for something easy to do right now then yes its fine. But its a poor place to go to if advancement, truth is what your looking for. "
good,"Xerox is a wonderful place to work. A average day you get up walk in the door and start taking calls. I did calls for Apple for the British. It was a very early shift. Some things I learned while I was working there include how to do tech support for all iOS devices. How British are diffrent in dealing with customer care bcause they are calm on the phone, You never know what dirrection the call could take. They are very polite most if the time when they are angry, That would probably have been the hardest part of the job as well, gageing if they were angry. I loved my co-workers and had worked with some of them before at other Xerox projects. I made a few new friend in training and we stuck together on the floor as well and are still friends. "
good,"Felt like family and I think that's what the problem is . Great Ope manger, but i believe truly over worked, needs an assistance. Co workers were all good, no problem other than the he say she say that seems to happen in all companies. This one is just more fluent. "
good,"Did not like the fact that nomatter how hard you work, they don't give raises."
good,"project based employment. no benefits. flexible hours. co-workers are kind and helpful, the job itself was informative about health insurance industry. "
good,"This was a place that took a while to get used to. The management is not professional at all. Very inappropriate behavior is constantly surrounding you. There is little to no support for agents. The particular center I worked for is the type of place where you want to keep a low profile. There are people who will have to have others fired for personal and not professional matters. The pay is good and there is plenty of incentive if work is done well. But also there may be time when one will not get a lunch break, so they will pass out a small bag of chips and juice boxes."
good,I learned a lot from my experiences in this company. Worked hard to learn as much about every aspect of the process as I could. The peope at this company are generally fantastic to work with. There are a number of difficulties advancing within the company and college education is held at a much higher value than skills learned from actually doing the job daily.
good,"The idea of making the money that I needed to insure that my family was taken care of was ideal. When I began working for the company I was sure that I was going to be able to fulfill what I needed to because the training was extensive and I felt that it would pay off. Soon after all the learning I could muster, the hours started to dwindle and the management made no effort to appease the general staff for the issues that caused 3 hour lunches and early shift ends. I was truly eager to make a difference and the 45 min commute and little to show for the headache made for a rocky situation. Management is not at all concerned on the actual goings on of a tech agent, but in whether or not they meet the quotas presented by the client. I am all for knowing that they may have quotas to meet, but not at the customer satisfaction expense by not meeting the goals set before the employees. I am not one to shortchange my customer service to meet a goal, I will not be rude or abrupt with customers to ensure that I meet a specific marker on the goal sheet. I have never worked for a call center prior to this and am not sure that I would be able to work for one in the future considering the restraints that I find that are not feasible when working toward customer satisfaction. I work for the goal of making a difference and being appreciated for what I am able to do for my customers, not making sure that my call times meet the norm and that I am able to force upsells down the throat of someone who is calling in because they are already ultimately annoyed with their service or the lack there"
good,"I worked at a Xerox call center contracted to take calls for Verizon Wireless. The job was utterly boring and even more so mentally draining due to being understaffed. Not enough employees, constant waiting queues for customers ensured that the moment you were done with one customer you had to immediately get to the next (unless you did what you ""weren't supposed to"" and abused a certain button called ""Call Work"" to give you 30 seconds). Many other employees are also notorious for abusing the system to avoid calls, which altogether only makes the queue worse for those who are honestly taking call after call."
good,only 10 an hr. months of boring training. Then the pay is commission based after that and can make less than 10. called ABC which even the govt probably couldn't figure out.
good,"I liked the ppl that i worked with,the company is a ok company"
good,High demand of hiring. Usually about 350 people in a 90 day span. 1 month down time and then do 90 day ramp again. Strong supported team required. Responsible for doing recruiting as well as the I9 verifying and all the on boarding.
good,Learned everything from soup to nuts. Never a typical day. Always something new and changes in procedures. Hardest part of the job was the job insecurity with 2 lay-offs every year since 2002.
good,"Unless doing a top, qualified role, all the positions are contract/temporary and can be cut at any minute without any rights to be compensated. This recently happened and many hard workers that had been there years were left with nothing."
good,I learned how to take care of Verizon wireless customers and their needs as the customers. I also learned how to ensure that the new reps that were getting out of training learned how to know exactly what the customer was looking for. Customers are not always easy to find out what they are looking for in the beginning of the call. However I have taught several agents how to figure out what exactly the customer is looking for in the first 3-5 minutes of the call. Ensuring that the call will be shorter for the customer and in the long run making the customer happy.
good,"A typical day at work for me is clocking in and waiting 10-30 minutes for my first call of the day. After about 2 hours in, I take my first 15 minute break and then I get back on the phone for about an hour and a half and then go to lunch. I get back on the phone, take another break for 15 minutes, 2 hours later I go home."
good,"Work is extremely stressful, but the people who work there are fun to be around. The company often has errors with pay, and the employees tend to suffer with little or no compensation. The rules seem to be like a high school environment and makes the employees feel like were boxed in, and at most times arent able to enjoy our work."
good,"I worked for a government entity owned by Xerox, so I can't comment on working for Xerox directly."
good,"A typical day at work is to go on appointments with new and prospective clients to inform them about Xerox business solutions. While out on appointments prospecting in the nearby areas is helpful to get more appointments. I learned a lot about copiers and printers and what is important when customers make buying decisions. Management while I was employed was very unsteady, 4 managers within 2 years. Hardest part of the job is the long sales process and competition lowballing their products. I enjoyed working with all my clients and co-workers and creating long lasting relationships."
good,for the most part i loved the job and to kow that i truely helped someone understand the prepaid debit card. people were recieving these cards not knowing what it was or how it worked mostly elderly that have never known anything outside of recieving their normal paperchecks. knowing that i helped them understand how to use the card and how to save atm fees and save money truely made me go home happy.
good,"I was with Xerox Business Services before they even were Xerox Business Services (they were formerly Affiliated Computer Services). Once Xerox bought Affiliated Computer Services (ACS), there were cutbacks. Unfortunately, I was one of them. They are outsourcing my job (accounting) to Mexico."
good,"A very corporate environment. Either you work there your entire career or you put in a year or two and leave. After spending over a year as a financial analyst I have decided to change career fields altogether. Some people love it, so people do not."
good,"Es una empresa global , con excelentes prestaciones y areas de aprendizaje profesional, cuenta con equipos de trabajo de profesionales con un alto nivel competitivo global."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty much coming in, finding your fit and you begin to work. You get an hour lunch outside of training (which you get a 30 minute lunch break). I learned better work ethics. The management is not great but fortunately for me, my supervisors were very easy to work with. I can't speak with all the supervisors there though. My co-workers were interesting people. The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with the different attitudes that different people came with. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving rewards for doing well."
good,"A work day consists of answering phones all shift, I learned a lot about computers and how to troubleshoot them, management is good, co-workers are fun but not all, hardest part is when the call flow is heavy, the most enjoyable is getting a nice and friendly caller."
good,"Decent company with good people, managers, etc. However, it is in a dying industry."
good,Bill and invoice complex accounts
good,"Company is going through change, core values and importance of local US job base in transition."
good,Xerox is a good company with an uncertain future. The employees are dedicated and willing to do what ever it takes for their customers.
good,IT application support group was growing and legacy employees know those processes. Monitored tickets and client contracts to ensure we were meeting SLAs.
good,Was working a contact with Google Play and other Google apps but the contract was pulled. I learned knew ways to use my apps and the knowledge of in app purchases and refunds.
good,"Xerox was a company that was contracted by the state of New Mexico to manage the MCO programs. It was a good job, because my primary responsibility was to help New Mexico residents and their chosen healthcare organization to coordinate benefits and payments."
good,"Your day goes by pretty fast if you stay busy, Go with the flow, learn as much as you can."
good,When first hired in they management was willing to do what they could to assure success. However management was not worried about employees and compensation changed frequently and this company was sold/branched to others in the time at this place.
good,"Working culture is good in Xerox."
good,"I take calls from customers who have problems with the printer or copier and I try to help them solve the issue and place a service call if needed. "
good,"Xerox is operating in a shrinking business space with little need for additional engineering investment. The people are great, but company vision for shrinking to meet market demands leads to a culture of scarsity and job insecurity."
good,Great place if you like being on phones. If you do not get good feedback from callers you are likely to be let go or hours are cut down. The pay is nice nevertheless.
good,Not included in Xerox culture and news which translates to other employees.not being given specific job objective .Not being trained properly by people chosen by the company to show employee how to drive a forklift for instance.Company not wanting to pay for proper trained people.
good,Fixed schedule. Was able to pick which schedule I wanted to work after training. First to choose their schedules was top of the training class. Poor management.
good,A good place to gain some experience. The culture and climate could improve. The employees did not look at the job as a real job they would quit whenever someone in management wanted to coach them.
good,"Working here is key if you're single and/or ready to mingle.  It's full of lusters looking to hook up and if it happens to be a manager (which it usually is), you've struck gold"
good,One of the best places to work at.   Just need to have better training rooms and longer training times for how many ppl they put in 1 room for 1 person to train.
good,"Het bedrijf is volop aan het heroriënteren, maar wordt daarbij gehinderd door korte termijn visie van een aantal aandeelhouders. Dit resulteert in grote onzekerheid over de toekomst van het bedrijf bij de werknemers."
good,This is a great company to use as a foundation for skills I have used in furthering my career. The environment was a fun one to work in and I learned so much during my tenure.
good,"Fairly easy to get hired on, at least any of the sites I've ever worked at. Due to the difficulties that they have with keeping their employees for long periods of time they are pretty lenient on most things that other companies would fire you for. Wages are in need of being raised to a livable wage, not being dependent on bonuses to be able to live would be nice. Benefits could be better, or at least cheaper for what they are. It's a good place to work if you are in need of something resembling a paycheck."
good,"Wish their business practices were more transparent for the clients they were serving. "
good,"Telling the good story rather than the truth seemed to be what those people in upper management wanted. "
good,"Worked there for almost 10 years and left because middle management tried to get more out of me than Possible. I was doing twice the work of someone making $10,000 more a year than me yet the whip  was still cracked."
good,"When I was there, potions were being eliminated more than were being created. This made it hard to move up in company. If a position became available, it was either not back filled or it was filled by someone whose position was being eliminated."
good,"I was in charge of scheduling a team of Technicians in New York and for the last 2.5 years worked from home.  It was a very fast paced environment between communicating with Managers, Technicians and customers.  When working in the office the culture was upbeat and fun but always professional.  When we began to work from home it was an adjustment but found ways around still staying connected with co-workers to keep morale high.  I would have to say the hardest part of the job was dealing with people that did not see eye to eye with you on a daily basis and did not understand the importance of some of the things you did to assist customers.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the relationships that were created with co-workers locally and in NY.  Most of which I still keep inn contact with today."
good,it was okay i answered called from the elderly that wanted to refill their prescription and then i verified their information and then sent their medication to them
good,"The job itself wasn't bad, not at all. Inbound technical support for mobile devices on Verizon Wireless's network. The problem came from management. Every day, no matter how well you preform, you would have a supervisor breathing down your neck to do better. Three passing surveys on Monday is good, but go for five on Tuesday. Five was good, but go for six on Wednesday. Failed a survey because a client mistook you for somebody else they talked to? Say goodbye to your monthly bonus and get ready to be shrugged off by management."
good,Xerox is a story of missed opportunity and missteps that continued on for decades. It was a great company that I hope gets it's act together someday. In the mean time its sad to watch its decline.
good,This call center has a lot of things that you will need to know about health care.  Its way too much for the little amount you get paid. It gets easier the more you stay.
good,Times have changed and it's not the same company it was just a few short years ago...…….too many changes in direction with the senior management...……...dwindling benefits......do not appear ro have a technology direction to sustain the company.
good,This was also a contract job for me. The contract was for one year. Within that year I picked up new knowledge and skills of dot matrix printers. I also learned a little bit of programming and knowledge of linux operating systems.
good,"A fine company to work for. High manager turnover. No holiday bonuses or even a card thanking employees. Do like coworkers, but feel disconnected with upper level decisions."
good,"Contract job during open enrollment. Had I continued, I believe I would have been offered a positon. The people were friendly and nice. Location was easy to commute."
good,After clocking in we log into an available computer and hookup provided equipment.  Computers sometimes didn't work as well as it should.  Inbound calls sometimes gave us callers that had been dropped by other agents and we had to repair relationships with upset customers.  Management was overworked and not always available to assist upset customers.
good,Not really great or really horrible. No outlook on ever becoming a direct hire- and they wonder why young professionals don't want to work for them...
good,"I enjoyed my short stay at Xerox,although I was fully aware of the company's recent shortcomings.I could also truly understand why this company is going under because of the ""wasteful"" attitude of some management personell."
good,I work within a small team to maintain printers across mid Missouri. We each cover our own area and are responsible for contacting and educating customers. Our manager is off site and does an account check monthly. It is very important to communicate and take responsibility for your own tickets.
good,"Used to be a productive, fun place to work. Great work and life balance. Lack opportunities for career advancement. Currently in a downsizing mode which made for a stressful work environment."
good,It is a scary time at Xerox.  With all of the restructuring that it is doing from the top down a lot of people are losing their jobs.  Not a stable time for employment at Xerox.
good,"The good times are over.  Smart people, used to be wonderful.  Tough times are ahead and lots of cuts, restructuring and uncertainty.  The overall direction is constantly changing.  Not a good place to start."
good,"Great people to work with, however corporate direction is headed in a downward spiral. Stressful place to work with corporate pressure to make performance gates constantly pressuring employees"
good,It was a great gig while it lasted.  Layoffs are common.  Work isn't terribly hard.  Lots and lots of process and meetings.  Managers are respectful of work / life balance.
good,"My typical day at work was self-managing myself and fixing and troubleshooting problems with the copiers onsite. I worked alone. I built a great relationship with the customer. However, my day was filled with stress as machines would break down or need supplies and seeing that I was taking care of a huge fleet of machines, I was running around a lot at this split site for Xerox where I had machines in various cities and towns."
good,the hardest thing was no one wanted to talk much at break. OK I have to stretch this a bit I was working on a project out or off site so I did not really get to talk much with other employees.
good,"I enjoyed helping the clients, but I did not feel as if I had support from upper management. This I a good place to begin your career if you a fresh out of college."
good,a company that uses contract worker so no job security every friday could be your last here i found it very hard to relax as your always on edge that you may be givin notice to quit any or every day
good,"Putting out fires."
good,"Mandatory overtime. Work you crazy. Little room for pay raises in set position, but they do advance to supervisory roles quickly. Childish co-workers who are not professional."
good,"My personal experience was mostly positive, with my team manager being one of the best. Made a lot of lasting friendships. They were always willing to give over-time if you needed it."
good,xerox  is no longer in Washington state. its a great company to work for out of high school. good pay and unlimited overtime sometime it was mandatory. you wouldn't know until the morning you started your shift.
good,"Xerox was a great place to work before management changed, once the new management came in everything changed and it was like you had to watch your on back. Everyone was out for themselves not thinking about the job of the company"
good,"it was a decent paying job, however it had no benefits unless permanent....i had to drive an hour to get there at that time and it was located around stores and restaurants which is always a plus."
good,"from the start of morning it was busy being in Workforce , guided and worked with management making sure agents were following their adherence . scheduling agents for lunches making sure we were meeting all service levels"
good,Took incoming phone call for Silverscript customers to refill their medications. Reached out to pharmacies to determine why RX were not going through.
good,It was good working at Xerox for the first 20 years. Want the jobs done with less people and put more work on the good workers and the lazy people got away with not doing their job.
good,Work with some very bright and talented technology professionals that embrace making a difference thru the technologies they manage.  Senior management is new and little to no experience in the areas they are managing..
good,Stable job and self motivating environment. many problem solving situations which keep the job interesting. good management leadership and flexibility in hours.
good,"Poor management, vulgar language was used in a daily basis. Management had no idea of what goes on. Workers were but in uncomfortable situations on a daily basis."
good,"I was in a call center setting where I had to answered calls regarding Senior Citizens prescriptions.  We received training in assisting us to provide a 3-month supply of medication.  Informed customers of receipts, prices, shipping dates and handling complaints.  Utilized payments by credit card/debit card to pay for customer’s prescriptions."
good,"Nice place to work, with really nice people.  The job is the job; you get out of it what you put into it.  Loved the fact that they allowed me to work remotely."
good,"Salary Increments are low"
good,Most of the people are very helpful especially during the time when new ones are having a hard time. The management knows how to encourage their employees to do better at work.
good,This is an okay company if you are needing something for short term. They are mainly out of the Philippians so job security in the states is not good plus they do not give raises very well. They have an 80% off shore (Philippians) and 20% on shore (US based). They just let go 5 people from my office because of this.
good,This job is very stressful and demands a lot from you. You are required to work the over time shifts. Breaks are short but the day is long. They expect you to know everything.
good,"Too many chiefs not enough Indians. Upper management too concerned with bean counting, and Lean Six Sigma to see the damage they are doing. Forgot how important customer satisfaction is."
good,They started to cut work hours due to business being slow and needs!  I feel the management didn’t do much and should have been at top it f their game
good,Would not work there again.  Management was not involved until they felt a need and then intervened without compete knowledge of the client's situation.  They were as frustrated as I was.  Also management was not truthful.
good,"A typical day at work: Good"
good,Prestava serviço terceirizado de digitação para Cooperativa Multiprofissional. O dia a dia era muito intenso. O ambiente de trabalho era agradavel.
good,"Xerox was an ok place to work. The opportunity for doing well in a day are available to you and support from management is available as well. "
good,The benefits trapped employees in the position. The stress level was very high and the employee turnover shows this. I want to learn more but feel like I have a chance for advancement and feel like I have worth to my company. Xerox did not have these options. Morale was always very low and my coworkers remained unhappy the majority of the time and favoritism ran rapid through the location.
good,"Worked at this company for 19 years and was valuable for 18 of those years. After my division was bought by another company, I was forced out by management so they didn't  have to  pay me  severance for my long years of service."
good,"The people here at Xerox are a lovely bunch, however the business strategy and direction is one that i still don't understand, there have been a lot of redundancies recently, which really don't make sense, if you want some experience in a tough industry, Xerox is a good place to work, however you do feel like just a number that has to be assessed and managed by HR, no name, no face, your just a number"
good,"You are the first line of defense and the clean up crew. You set them up for success and clean up the mess when they fail. "
good,"A typical day at Xerox is non stop fast paced environment, consist of dealing with angry customers. I learned about drug prescription policies. i also learned not to order important medicine through the mail cause there could be many reasons why the medication could not be delivered. "
good,Great job to gain experience in banking customer service. Try to maintain professionalism even if the environment around you does not seem professional. Use the experience to advance banking knowledge.
good,"You are very busy not too many breaks, and take ALOT of phone calls. Overall it is not a bad environment it's a typical call center with certain expected behaviors."
good,"Xerox is a decent place to work, but the company is not growing and is continuously in cost cutting/employment reduction mode. Much uncertainty there."
good,On I typical day we receive incoming mail and sort it into the different departments and process each piece with either entering data into a system and\or placing a corresponding barcode on it so it can be scanned into our system.
good,"One terrible manager can destroy the moral of an awesome group of employees, Xerox had many terrible managers sadly. There was a time when Xerox valued their employees and treated them with respect. I must admit that my early years with the company were awesome but that soon changed when a new pay system was implemented and the company became a place of dishonest competition and disrespect for employees that were otherwise loyal to the company."
good,Facility in Webster NY is old.  Lack of good physical working environment made very long days.  Did not feel my skills were being used effectively.  Provided great salary for family over the years
good,Not a bad place to work. Was a very fun environment to be in. Everyone is willing to help if you had questions on how to do something. Supervisors was very understanding and willing to help if need it.
good,"Typical days were either busy with an influx of calls or slow because the system was down. Some Managers truly wanted their team members to succeed and to exceed goals, others weren't that concerned or couldn't be bothered."
good,"A typical day a Conduent is that you come in clock in and answer phone calls from members that have benefits questions, calling to place refill orders through mail order, and calling to enroll in the plan."
good,"My goal out of college with a degree in marketing was to work for a Fortune 500 company. I achieved that by going to work for Xerox has a sells rep and had a very successful career."
good,"Breaks and lunches were prescheduled each day and if your call ran into your break or lunch period, as part of schedule adherence policy, you were encouraged to either skip or only use time remaining. They knew it wasn't legal to say that, but they talked out of both sides of their mouth. The department manager, who to my understanding is no longer there, stated in the same sentence, we are adults and you do not have to receive permission to use the restroom, but if you need to move your bowels each day and it takes you at least ten minutes to do so, than you will need to provide a doctor's note. Again, talking on both sides of their mouth. Very stressful job, as you needed to receive a perfect score on each call in order to receive your maximum pay per call. That's where schedule adherence comes to play. If they nit pick and your receive less than a perfect score on a call, but you have perfect attendance and leave and return on your breaks and lunch on time, that makes up for the lower score received and you could still receive your maximum pay. However, the work environment is not healthy enough to sustain staying at your desk for 8 and a half straight hours and no breaks, should your calls with clients go into your scheduled break and lunch times, which happened almost daily. The managers, except for one, not including the department manager were great. But there is only so much they can do, in order to provide a healthy work environment. Xerox, now Conduit is always playing for a new contract as they are a third party employer, basically providing outsourcing jobs abroad."
good,"I was direct at Xerox for 15"" years and then contract for three years. I was an emerging leader and sent around the world and sent to school for two master's degrees, MSEE and MBA.  None of the above mattered when it cam time to improve the bottom line.  I was IRIF'd.  They sought me back, but then treat contract like second class citizens.  It is hard to feel loyal when the company is not loyal to you.  No matter how good a job you do, they will still cut you.  There is no development, training and team building.  There was a lot of waste, excess and poor management of resources.  It didn't matter how good a job you did if numbers needed to be reduced and you fit the EEO class, you were gone.  Xerox is a great company, but it is slowly downsizing every year which does not bode well for the future."
good,"I was trained onsite, made sure to follow the compliance and privacy regulations. When I left they never gave me my PTO that I had earned. They worked with my schedule and my disabilities as well."
good,"I thought that the company was good as it dealt with mostly business and there phones for there companies. What I did find out is that they do like to change polices a great deal, mostly on a daily basis. I do not mind changes but not quite so often."
good,"Xerox was a great place to work for and I loved my job.  The employees are very friendly and we did monthly fun events.  I had 1 AWESOME boss, out of 2.  The issue with Xerox is an employee only gets promoted if they are part of the ""Executive Management"" click...whether or not they liked you.  Another criteria that weighed heavily on your career advancement is you would only get that opportunity if you were an employee that kept their mouth shut, never complained, never told the truth, and never questioned anything.  Besides being grossly underpaid, the primary issue with Xerox is the ""click"" Executive Management has (are we adults in a corporation, or are we teens in high school?) and their fear and intimindation of those few of us that actually had a brain and were intelligent - these people were never part of the ""click"""
good,Work hard but always keep your personal goals higher than the firm requires. Always look to upgrade your skills and stay relevant. Print is changing!!
good,"I am concerned about the future of Xerox, the company seems to be more interested in outsourcing than employee development. We have seen major changes in the last several years and they have not all been good changes."
good,"lacks communication to the employees about important things.sucks, paid good  but not for the headache it caused. Management seems ok but doesn't give straight answer give very broad answers. Get to meet new people and work on how to handle hundreds of different attitudes."
good,"During my tenure, I had a very successful career at Xerox.  Although  when CEO Anne Mulchahy left the company things were never quite the same again.."
good,"Recent and sudden layoffs, that came with no notice, have left us severally understaffed and overworked. The moral is very low and everyone is wondering if they are going to be next, it's a hard environment to work in right now."
good,Feels a little overwhelming with people looking over your shoulder like you won't do your job if they don't look. A typical workday consists of answer approximately 80 calls and selling insurance.
good,Xerox is a fast paced enviroment surronded by a team who doesnpt mind getting in and going for the challenge.  Management could use more training when it comes to interacting with it's employees.
good,It is nice place to work in . the town is great and for kids especially . the people are good . working environment is good . Had good time there other than it is in a very small town.
good,"My review of Xerox was that it was overall a good stable job but the pay was low and there seemed to be a lack of advancement but If i had to take a job from xerox again, I would. Our typical day at work was taking phone calls for customer service for Verizon Wireless customer care."
good,"it is just ok, the company is not sure what they want to focus on. too many different directions and no clear objectives."
good,It is stressing because of strict deadlines  but I enjoyed it because I like what I do. I work at home so I can attend to my family while making money.
good,"I enjoyed the time I worked at Xerox. The most enjoyable part was working with the people internally.  It was a people company for a lot of years, but changed."
good,Typically I assisted with password resets. If a member called in frustrated because they couldn't log in I would do my best to assist. to me that job was awesome!!! Best job ever!
good,"Some days were slow others were slamming, the customers are the worst part of the job. Seemed as if the rules as far as phone calls changed everyday. The higher ups breathe down the managers' necks and therefore causing them to do the same to us, causing too much commotion."
good,"Enjoyed working for Xerox for many years went through many changes ups and down but management changed the last few years and when people hit the 50 ceiling it was common knowledge they wanted you out because if you had many years your salary was higher and had 6 weeks vacation it became to costly for them to keep you. Never got to take all my vacation too busy but if I used it for 2 weeks at a time viewed as being gone too much even with almost perfect attendance. Worked over and above expectation worked against me. They provided training but only if you were willing to forgo your work to get it done so someone else had to pick up the slack. Our equipment became outdated and would cost more in over head so they outsourced it to an outside company and did not give us chance to move anywhere else in the company we were told we were done. Unless you were under a certain age or pay level."
good,"In XEROX, work culture is very much poor, due to which I always get frustrated and always to think to switch a job. Also i didn't get the clear work instructions what needs to be done. They always presumes things that I should be knowing about it."
good,I worked there for six months and all my paychecks were late. we have bills to pay and its not right that my checks were always up to a month late.management was very rude
good,"His job while is great in offering as much overtime as you could want has a high turn over rate. This is due to the stressfull in environment. Strict regulations, and competitiveness."
good,"just needs to pay better for the work done. benefits are ok just so much out of pocket expense. no cubicles, very noisy , they try to keep it cool , break room is a long walk as are bathrooms."
good,"It is a job that works to assist others with their accounts , a typical day at work is disputing charges, replacing cards, being a therapist, and giving account info"
good,"When I worked there, supervisors were on their phone texting, answering calls, watching tv shows etc. and didn't want to help workers when needed and if someone called in asking to speak with a supervisor there were times when they would tell us employees to not transfer the call to them and that we should try to handle the situation ourselves."
good,"In my opinion, the company does not focus on employee morale. Appears to have no regard for employee loyalty. Focus is more on financial gain than maintaining quality customer service"
good,Sr Management is indecisive and creates an environment that is stressful.  People are way overworked and burnt out.   Can't continue to do the same work with less and less people.   Need for stronger leadership at the top.
good,"The people are fairly nice, but being a sales environment it is relatively stressful and quotas are required to be met at all times. Depending on what you do at Xerox the experience does vary greatly. If you work in service, you will view things from a very different perspective than if you worked in sales."
good,"Am besten war wirklich die gute Kameradschaft. Habe dort wirklich nette und hilfsbereite Kollegen kennengelernt. Es war allerdings auch viel Druck da. Die Zahlen mußten geschafft werden. Allerdings muß ich auch sagen, das sich immer zusammengesetzt wurde, wie das Ziel dann erreicht werden kann."
good,i am just saying disgusting and dissapointing me.....very hardly workplace....... management was not so good... this is my hardest part of my life in this job
good,"my experience with Xerox began well with my training but after my 10 weeks of that it was all down hill. I never understood my pay which fluctuated by circumstances out of  my control and never made what they promised me I would, they do not allow us to be honest with the customers and the supervisors were abusive with their authority I do not recommend this job."
good,"The company was great for certain things and not for others.  I was able to move up the chain quickly, which was great, but it was because of the high turnover in management.  "
good,Xerox is an OK place to work if you are desperate. The management continues to give there employees false information just to get them to volunteer for more responsible. People leave and they do not replace them.
good,The office is located within another company and sometimes its hard to talk on the phone with users with Xerox issues. The management team has little communication with interaction of staff.
good,"At my time at Xerox, I worked the verification department where I would make sure everything matched correctly to the customers profile. As well as taking incoming calls updating the customers information."
good,"Trabalhei 8 anos na Nextel, representando a marca em varias regiões do interior de são paulo e minas gerais."
good,"There is not much to say about Xerox, Inc."
good,"At this job, I felt like a dime a dozen. They'd hire and train anyone, 90% quit, and the floor was so packed that the supervisors were unavailable to assist those who needed assistance."
good,management to employee communication is terrible. management shows favoritism.  does not communicate well with seasoned employees. it's all in who you know.
good,"Xerox has been suffering from a serious identity crisis issue during the brief time I was employed here.  The acquisition, then ""split"" of what was once ACS was a great example of this schizophrenia."
good,"A Typical Work Day At Xerox, Well Systems Crash Team Leads Hardly Show UP on Time.. Very Unorganized And Unprofessional, I learned To Just Take it One Day At At Time Here At the Hayes Location Due To On-going Changes, Hours Getting Cut, Down To the Terrible Bug Problem They HAD..!! The Most Enjoyable thing About the Job Is The Bonuses And Awards You Get For BEING GREAT!! Other than That I Would Not Recommend !! Recently The Company Was Bought Over Buy Conduent Hopefully Things Get Better At the Hayes Location.. Because They Tend To Over Work Their Employees And NOT Wanna Provide More Pay..."
good,"The people that I worked with were decent. The work environment did lack on occasion professionalism and could be a bit stressful. There was no consistency with regard to the expectations and training. However, all and all the job was decent and I did have some nice moments."
good,Consumers were verbally abusive and Xerox did not pay enough or provide any incentives to have to put up with that type of treatment. Manager sat at their desks all day and played on their cell phones and did not have answers to questions about procedures.
good,I've worked for the company for more than 16 years and my pay has raised a total of $4. Upper management gives themselves massive raises and doesn't provide anything for their employees. The only good thing about this company is the insurance and that sky rocketed when the ACA was put in place.
good,Started my career with Xerox had some ups and downs althrough. But for minimum sized firm Xerox gives opportunity to shine and kick start their career
good,"Had a challenge of attrition from past 8 months and almost 11 team members quit from my team but no support from the management. Was worried of such a thing from management. Apart from this, I am happy with the company."
good,"When I worked here management was terrible, people were getting promoted that shouldn't be.  It was like a horrible High School experience.  Cliques and drama.  You were criticized constantly, barely ever praised.  Negative reinforcement tactics.  No advancement unless you were a close friend of someone in management.  ABC compensation is  a joke.  Got hired there again a few years later, couldn't show up for first day, did everything I could and got a different job... too much anxiety about going back."
good,"I was a full-time employee in the Managed Services branch of Xerox for nine years. I acquired a great deal of knowledge, skills and relationships which I still leverage today. During my time with Xerox, they acquired ACS and were trying to push a new, yet to be fully defined, service offering. To save on costs, Xerox began to adopt the ACS service model of near shoring to Guatemala. Over the next few years I saw many of my co-workers let go due to the near shoring effort. The constant change wasn't only at the lowest levels. I was fortunate to enough to have only two managers during my nine years. But, my manager's manager changed almost bi-anually. This constant change led to a lack of unified vision, and stifled creativity, innovation and empowerment. The company has recently split in two, Xerox and Conduent respectively. A failure to merge. Once all of the right-sizing efforts are complete, I'm hopeful Xerox can return to its innovative roots to forge a successful future. Long gone are the days of the Xerox PARC, replaced now with a 'winning is everything' montra."
good,"Xerox is a busy office. You are on the phone with customers continuously and only get a breather when you have a break or lunch.  Management changes constantly so it's difficult to give an opinion.  There is no ""hardest part of the job"".  It's relatively easy, but can get stressful because you never know how the customer will react and sometimes it's not pleasant.  You have to really know how to handle people and calm them down.  They are angry at the company, not you and you always have to keep that in mind.  "
good,"Typical days started with a review of issues in the office via personal computer, followed by management of time and resources to keep things running smoothly."
good,"- Fast paced environment"
good,This company has given me the opportunity to prepare myself for the corporate world.  I do have a little dismay about being laid off after 8 years.  This is along with not being able to go to another campaign without a huge pay cut.  I just hope that all of the skills obtained will point me in a brighter direction.
good,"Very proactive and high call volume call center environment."
good,Good job with overtime offered to make extra money. The hours were 10 hours a day working toward 50 hours per week. It was somewhat difficult to get up at 5 and be home at 7.
good,I worked for Xerox-ACS under the Verizon wireless project.  Overall not a bad experience but the culture needs to improve.  They need to become a company that values their employees and not allow the pay to be based off surveys
good,A typical day at work was answer phones for Verizon Wirelss . You were held to a flow chart that you had to meet every week. The management did not always go by that for everyone.
good,"Was hired in the Supplies Business Group to sell Xerox branded remanufactured toner to Distribution. Small but cohesive Division. Great group and we achieved the highest sales the Division ever had, but then were merged with a larger Division. Culture changed immediately and today no one remains from the previous group. Best part of job was representing a great brand. Toughest part was the legacy people who were hanging on to what Xerox was in its heyday."
good,"Call center, help the customer. The hardest part of this job is that you will be given different information to give to customers from different supervisors. A difficult job if you cannot talk to people"
good,"I started in january, the most busy of all, so I had no breaks , and a 30 min lunch. The workers are nice ans so are the staff, it's just too chill. No one gets anything done for the workers or customers, but the workers have to take the blame. If you can work in medium stress, this job will work."
good,Xerox is a good company to work for but the people are not very professional. the supervisors don't really help their team and the hours are sometime unreasonable
good,"Too reactive.....too many layers of management. "
good,"•	Systematic receiving priority freight"
good,"I started with this company, pay was great but not the best job. I grew horribly ill to where I needed to go to the hospital. I had a note and everything. Absent for 1 day and I got fired. I understand that they are strict to their attendance policy but come on. That's uncalled for. Also my pay was 13.50...not bad. But for the pay period I had worked when I got fired was at 7.25. GYPT. Horrible company to work for."
good,"Good team to help up as each project is by team, and working time is balanced. "
good,I learned a lot about working in a corporate environment. I would not change the experience I received during my time with this company. I took every opportunity to learn more and to get things done. Management seemed to appreciate this effort.
good,A broad and diverse clientn base but fragmented in the way that delivery is executed.  I expect this to improve with the spin-off of Conduent
good,"Okay management, fun workplace, limited opportunities for growth."
good,"typical day at work , always busy "
good,"always busy besides December "
good,"Xerox Corporation has a solid brand with a rich history of producing cutting edge technologies. In the last 10 yrs, it has struggled to co-mingle new acquisitions and companies into it's existing culture that created subsequent YOY revenue and profit declines. "
good,"Good learning experience in a corporate environment, with many transferable skills. However the work environment and pay were not what I was looking for considering the high stress level incrued at a retention call center for Sprint. Additionally, the health benefit package did not at all fit my needs with little provided in the health care packages available."
good,"Coordination with the Ops teams, guide and share best practices of the industry with the Ops teams. Constant update of self and the processes."
good,the good part about the job is you get to help alot of old people who are struggling with their medication or understanding their plan but the work environment is stressful and no advancements are given out unless your're known (favortism).
good,"I would come to work get my desk ready and start taking calls , i loved talking to the people of course theirs always gonna be ones that aren't pleasant, Not that worried about that the management was under so much scrutiny that it made the work enviroment such a  horrible place to work. Sometime co-workers was the only thing keeping me going at that place besides the money of course, the hardest part is having to have the best production up to a tee i mean perfect production sometimes it just cant happen management should understand but I know its not their fault, they are just tryign to produce statistics for the client. The most enjoyable is the pay and also the cookouts co workers of course. "
good,"Day starts with RFXs handling."
good,Geen groei / doorgroei mogelijkheden bij dit bedrijf. Er vindt veel outsourcing plaats. Bedrijf staat echter goed op de CV.
good,"Empresa inovadora e exemplar, com 50 anos de Brasil, mas que perdeu o timing da migração da tecnologia de cópias para impressões, do óptico para o digital e de produtos para serviços."
good,"It was a boring, monotonous job, sitting in a chair for 6 hours a day, power goes out frequently, and at time the supervisors make decisions in the moment rather than have contingency plans,and the position for supervisor is not often coveted due to the overwhelming amount of work. That being said, the fellow employees are often good natured and help whenever they can, and one can talk to others so long as they respect each other and keep their voices low. Not to mention that you can use an mp3, so long as it doesn't have a camera or wifi. The average day was, arrive, clock in, open all the programs and start processing, 15 minute breaks in the morning and afternoon, and half an hour to an hour lunch break (flexitime). Overall a good place to start, but definitely not to stay in."
good,"I started out really liking this job, but I have found there's not enough room for advancement. After I've been at a workplace for over a year I'd like to see other opportunities arise, but there have not been."
good,"Xerox has a well rounded management staff and offers a level compensation package. While also proving to be an equal opportunity employer allowing employees to interview and relocate to other positions in the company."
good,A typical day at work is checking deceased participants accounts to see of there are benefits due to their family once they pass and have those benefits due issued.
good,"Handling one of the complex account in Government Healthcare is very challenging in a way but I am happy and content with my account because everyday is a new learning. I've learned so much from my account that I extend it to my co-workers. I shared my knowledge to them and help them with their accounts. "
good,"Training was okay, but had a lot of information to grasp especially when the trainer talked too fast and had an accent that made it hard to understand sometimes."
good,"Bonne entreprise malgré les problèmes de gestion du personnelle de recrutement, mauvaise organisation, pas de plan d'action ou dévolution de l'activités."
good,"Revisar mis correos, hacer los reportes con la informacion del dia anterior, evaluar el trabajo del grupo a mi cargo, monitorear llamadas para hacer una evaluacion completa del servicio proporcionado."
good,"Always able to work independently with little or no supervision."
good,on the phones all day. you have to have an outgoing personality to enjoy this job. I liked this job due to the fact that I met numerous people daily. I enjoyed hearing about there people's day. Hardest part about the job was letting customers curse you out call after call and you having to be very polite in order to sell an item after fixing an issue they had.
good,Management needed to be improved and all training staff needs to have the same techniques and protocols. Need to do a better job with updates and informing its employees.
good,Xerox was a fine place to work but since they vendor through Highmark that was where our problem began. Communications between Highmark and the managers was not efficient enough therefore not efficient enough for the csr. Xerox wants to help employees but does not get a chance to do so .
good,"Xerox is a workplace where I was able to use my retail experience from Radio Shack and assist customers better with troubleshooting their devices, upgrading to newer devices as well as resetting them and saving information in their devices that a 'soft reset' would normally delete."
good,This is a typical call center environment. The company provides ongoing training and development and allows the opportunity to get a few skill sets under your belt.
good,I loved the position I had within the company. I just feel like the managers should not have been in the position they were in.
good,Work ws good. I enjoyed helping the customers. Upper mngement needs work. There ws few good co-workers. The hardest prt ws the job ws not being ble to help people sometimes. The best prt ws helping those that I could.
good,No proper work define.employee does not know what he has to do.No Training.co-workers are good.No Target and plan.working environment is ok ok.
good,"-flexible schedule and overtime requirements - coverage determination and appeals with Med D "
good,"get on the phones , call take over hundreds of calls in the que , call outbound to customer some time , management did not care to much about employees co - workers I love them , the only thing is they did not like there job so they was not happy hardest part was getting help when need it"
good,"Time off is and benefits are okay.  Lack of work life balance and overall company morale.  It's an okay place to start off in the work place with.  However, for a seasoned professional it may lack in opportunities and managerial structure."
good,"Xerox was a great place to work. Very casual, and most employees are allowed to listen to music/radio while working as long as it doesn't affect their performance. Changes in management and in the pay structure have hurt the employees, and despite numerous complaints management is rarely seen much less around to address issues."
good,"Time and goal oriented position to aid clients on the provision of adequate work experience. Building rapport with the members of the doctor's office, appointee representatives, and the members."
good,collected on student loans on behalf of the bank before they were written off as bad debts. learned the art of negotiation and customer service here - people were much more willing to make payment arrangements with someone who showed them respect
good,This job is ok if you want to be somewhere were your job is threatened everyday. They find different reasons everyday to try to fire someone. This job would be great if they focused more on what's important. The people are messy and it is best to stay to yourself try not to make friends.
good,"A lack of space often made working days impractical. The majority of co-workers were fine and made the day enjoyable. During my time there, I saw an improvement in communication by the management to staff."
good,I have learned many communication skills and customer service skills working at Xerox. once a supervisor it is hard to move up further in the company. a typical day at work for me is going in and assisting my agents in learning how to navigate through the system and helping them through there calls. I also help the agents develop de-escalation skills in escalated situations. I keep track of my teams performance and the performance of my peers teams. As a team we brainstorm ideas on how to improve our team stats and how to ensure our agents are growing and improving there skills on how to improve on there calls. The thing I enjoy the most about my job is helping my agents grow and being able to teach and guide them to become a better agent. I enjoy my co-workers as they feel like my family away from home. I think the hardest part of my job is not always being able to help my agents when they have a question due to many other hands being up in the air.
good,I enjoyed my work and my immediate co-workers but my manager's people skills were minimal.  There is no set training you learn as you go.  You are required to snitch on your co-worker instead of working together to get the work done.  My manager liked to keep the employee's at each other and would setup people to cause problems within the department
good,"I woudn't recommend this as a great compay to work for. High Stress, Long Massive Hours, and they do not treat their employees god at all."
good,"You have access to all the tools and software you want to get the job done."
good,Enjoyed working at the company. Worst part about the company was terribly poor job security. Upper management managed quarter-to-quarter.
good,"Enjoy my co workers "
good,Great company to get experience with. Salaries are low for the job requirements. Management competence level is very questionable.
good,I enjoyed this job it was very informative on the basics of working with medical records as far as being prepared to be entered for data entry. It was very repetitive environment and was fast paced.
good,Empresa que investe muito nos funcionários no desenvolvimento profissional. Permite a convivência com partes interessadas de outros países.
good,"Boa de trabalhar , mais que não proporciona estabilidade de crescimento."
good,"A typical day at work is a tad bit stressful."
good,"This job had loads of stress involving reaching required work. It is indeed a call center so everything call you get is different, xerox expects you to make every call have the same results, as that literally is impossible."
good,"Works here a s a contractor worker.  A typical day is usually very easy going and laid back.  Sometimes dealing with AOMs can be stressful."
good,My co-workers are wonderful.  I loved training.  I would just like a Monday-Friday or Tuesday - Saturday office job that would put more of my office skills to use.
good,"Due to the split of Xerox, it is not currently a stable company to work at.  For the past 3 years they have been pushing more jobs to India, Philippians and other off shore locations.  This means 3 years of wondering if your job is safe.  Other than the stress of Reductions In Force, the co-workers were excellent."
good,Is a decent job if you are in a transitional period in your life. Not much opportunity to move higher up within the company. Morale in the place is weak.
good,Not a lot of job advancement opportunities and when they were available you weren't promoted in a timely manner. Management was decent. Met a lot of great people here as well.
good,Loved working at Taco Bell. Met new and exciting people each day. If I wouldn't have gotten pregnant and so sick with the pregnancy I would have stayed with the company.
good,The company does not allow employees have fun or be creative with their work. There is no sense of creativity at all. Everybody at the company has a sense of hating their job.
good,"This place is not for someone looking to grow and advance professionally. It's more a stepping stone to move on to other opportunities (outside of Xerox). And it's not a place to seek job security, whether project-based/temporary or permanent employee, you're subject to being laid off for a period, rehired for a period, then laid off again, then rehired again (length of laid off and hired times can vary)."
good,"una experiencia hermosa, entre compañeros fomentamos siempre un clima cálido.. no se brinda una estabilidad que de seguridad.."
good,"I work with internal business development directors and external clients.  I enjoy the team I work with.  Great people, great atmosphere of 'work hard, play hard', which makes working much more fun.    I support the Europe and the US, so I have learned dual process guidelines.   I enjoy working with external clients, and maintain an excellent rapport with them."
good,"management didn't give importance to hardworking employees"
good,"Management is not good, they really do not know how to treat a female employee in the open forum or on the floor. "
good,"Daily review of contract agreements, to ensure all polices were met and delivered within contract agreement, review of SLA's invention with all departments to ensure quality assurance"
good,OK workplace with decent management. It is not a place for much advancement nor incentive or bonus pay options. Good for steady and plenty hours. Doesn't are to much about family and outside life. Is not willing to accommodate to employees
good,Typical day would be assisting applicants with apply for Medicaid. I learn not take what a customer says personal...because they are just having a bad day. Management was ok and my co workers were amazing to work with. My job there wasn't that hard....it was pretty easy. The most enjoyable part is always helping my customers.
good,"good place to work, long hours taking away from family time and after 10 years insurance and benefits skyrocketed making it unafforable to have so had to look for new job with better cheaper insurance for my family."
good,"The typical day involved obtaining criticial information via phone or fax to process the medication needs for prior authorization of the patient or medical facility for the patient. I always found the management staff, which I was a part of until a new system was begun, to be extremely helpful in any assistance needed.  I found most of my co-workers to be co-operative and positive in their daily routines."
good,"management is very rude to the customers and also there workers, i belive they need to be paid more. because people work to hard here to get nothing."
good,It was a good place to work at.And the worker was nice. I got along with veryone. Veryone worker together and help each other out.
good,"A typical day at work involves socializing, and friendly conversation."
good,Company was sold and absorbed. Management was often not available. Constant changes in work related responsibilities. Optional work from home opportunities. Pay was decent compared to similar jobs.
good,the pay could be better for leadership with all of the requirements. the hours can be long if you can't get time approved off.  need to have patience and the ability to work well with different personalities
good,"The job and responsibilities are not the problem at all. I'm not sure if all of the locations have the same rules and policies but the Federal Way, Wa. location was ridiculous. And the pay structure is horrible"
good,Been manipulated into thinking this job would be processing applications. They tell you that to get  you in. Once training is completed they throw you on phones (call center) and throw you to wolves. This company writes you up for everything. You are no allowed out of your cubicle for more than 7 mins a day or you get wrote up. Hope you don't have to go to the bathroom a lot.
good,"The most rewarding part of the job was having the knowledge, skills, & ability to be able to assist the caller & resolve their issues on  the first call, in a professional, timely fashion."
good,Fun place to work nice management. The job is easy but yet challenging. I have worked for the company the last 5 years and it has been a good experience.
good,A typical day is holding your hand up waiting endlessly for a superior to deny or approve a credit amount while the customer is irate. Management is spotty and varies from location to location . Co workers can be a social environment I wouldn't suggest entertaining it  though . The hardest part is holding your composure through the foolery of fraudulent customers.
good,Good place to learn new things.  Management provides training for the staff.  Learned a lot about good customer service.
good,"I work they evening shift, typically busy during the first have of my shift and quiet during the second half. My Co- worker are great to work with and there is no difficulty in my daily responsibilities. The hardest part of my job is the commute,  however, the most enjoyable  is the end of shift."
good,"There was no real room for growth,. Not aa career, just a job. Co workers where ok, Atypical day at work was signing on to computer and taking calls. Most enjoyable pat of the job was assisting others with there needs."
good,"Oppressive management that takes care of the people in their clique and micro-manages the people under them.  Favoritism, retaliation that goes un-noticed by upper management.  Or they are part of the clique too."
good,"- Customer service rep"
good,"I was a ""Picker Packer"" in Xerox's warehouse. i enjoyed the work.details are included in my resume of all duties performed."
good,Currently the job has gotten very stressful as this is because of the change in management. With new management comes change and some change is good but total change can be destructive.
good,"working for Xerox was nice, actually its pretty straight forward they usually work well to make your hours and shifts and the pay is decent I would go back to this company again."
good,Speak with multiple members a day that are usual upset and yell.  Management is laid back unless you mess up in which they are very strict.  Co-workers are relax and good to talk to.  The hardest part of the job is providing the member with accuracy on their insurance and also answering the questions that aren't asked.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the 30 min lunch which isn't paid for and we have a break room with just tables and fridges
good,"I have worked with this company for three different projects but have yet been applied to permanent employee. I am not alone in this hurdle. The company seems to prefer to hire for seasonal work, which isn't beneficial in the employees' work/home life ratio. Most people need a steady income."
good,"It all depends on the project."
good,"A typical day at Xerox would be receiving inbound calls from irritated and rude customers (minus a few nice ones), and assisting them with their problems that were more often than not caused by Xerox's disorganization. My co-workers were all friendly and my team felt like a family, but the ""bloodline"" ended at the upper management, who were always rude and disrespectful to the lower employees. Despite the management being rude and unhelpful, I did manage to gain some customer service experience and finished my training at the top of the class, resulting in a promotion. The hardest part of this job would be getting a supervisor to help when you have a difficult situation that requires their attention. They will do everything they can  to avoid taking over your problems. This may be a little harsh, but I cannot think of one thing I would classify as enjoyable at Xerox."
good,"The job is very here in the moment. I can honestly say the time spent; depends on your work ethics, and goals. If looking for a job in between jobs this is a great place."
good,"This company is a good company to work for, easy work, however pay is not the best.  The pay is not very competitive.  And the pay structure needs revamping.  Advisors are paid significantly higher than the Supervisors, and there is no incentive to stay a supervisor.  Once you become salary, you can decide to get back on the phones and choose your shift, never required to participate in a site wide required shift bid, make overtime with your salary amount as an hourly employee, have the potential to earn Rewards based compensation.  This is additional money paid to you based off of your performance.  I am hunting for a new job now simply because there are advisors that I manage on my team, making way more money than I am.  Communication sucks.  As a direct supervisor, I should be informed first of any decisions to suspend or terminate any of my advisors.  I am finding that I learn things after the fact and execution.  And just because of the Shift bid system, which ranks you based off your performance, there is no balance or consideration of what your life needs are outside of the job.  They do attempt to find other advisors to swap schedules with you but often there is no one to swap with."

good,"Customer are pretty rude on the phone especially in level 2 in the fraud department."
good,"They have high turnover for a reason, stressful job and imposing passive aggressive management. They have paid training though so that's a plus. in need of cash/ job quick then yes apply otherwise don't bother."
good,"A typical day at work consists of sitting down in a half cubical. You learn a lot and are continuously trained on policies and strategies. Management consists of a hard tiered system where you are required 6-months in any position to have the small chance to promote. If you can handle talking to customers that can be very demand and Irritated for any reason. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers, which is 100% of the work that you do. The most enjoyable part is your coworkers and interactions with them. The population is diverse in background and experience."
good,"Typical day: Clock in, stay on the phones (or else), take a 15 min break, ""back to the phones!"" (*bullwhip crack*), 1hr lunch (dont expect this to last for long), ""back to the phones!"" (*bullwhip crack*), another 15 min break, ""back to the phones!"" (*bullwhip crack*). Fin"
good,"It was a fun place to work and had some great co-workers.  The only downside was the upper management - no raises, or chance for advancement and then without warning they lay off many workers while giving raises to the upper management.  "
good,"The most difficult part of the job is the hustle. This part isn't always for everyone, but if business to business sales is something that you enjoy, then this company might be for you."
good,"Learned to ability to maintain calls effectively quickly and correctly."
good,Selling Xerox is fun and rewarding ! I really loved the flexibility of my schedule and meeting people. The company was very structured and there was lots of training
good,Xerox has too few employees to conduct professional contact between Medicare customers and Customer Care Representatives.  The dynamic is to see how many customers we can assist as to Average handle time <10 minutes.  Customers are of Medicare age and require tender loving care as to their age and understanding of Medicare regulations.
good,"MRS was an ok place to work. I liked it because it was close to home. It's a call center, so you have a lot of departments to choose from if there are positions available. There wasn't any real opportunity for growth, unless you knew a hire up."
good,This environment is a customer support / customer first environment.  The company is very good about providing the training you need to succeed at your job.  The work hours does not make it conducive to having a stable life outside of work.
good,"A typical day involves logging in and take calls"
good,"Management wasn't great at all the pay was but for this to be a temporary company, they should offer benefits like health ins, dental etc"
good,"o	Currently working as a Client Services Principal for Health and Welfare Benefits with Xerox HR Solutions LLC since July 2010. Thorough understanding of design and development of multi-tier applications utilizing Sybase Knowledge for Ongoing Client in Health and Welfare. I have good interpersonal communication and Team-leadership skills. Writing Business Requirement Documents for Client Implementation and Ongoing Teams."
good,"Xerox is going through a transition to verticalize their sales force and focus more on services and solutions vs. just equipment. Although the ""Services"" message is being preached more & more, at the end of the day, they (lower & middle management) are still focused on the same old stuff,  the 30-60-90 day grind of ""what have you done for me lately"". My team was once a strong, cohesive, high performing unit in the Rocky Mountain region that has now been reduced to a fragmented and unstructured office where no one has a manager in the same state and some our accounts that we covered locally are now been covered by reps out of state (all for the sake of verticalization). Bad idea to break relationships."

good,"Answer inbound calls, and help customers to understand their bill, talk about the plans that they were on, and possible upgrades.

good,"Learning to enroll clients in health care plan, the pro, and cons of the medical plans.  The difference in Medicaid, and Medicare benefits."
good,"This job had ups and downs. Since it is a fast food restaurant, the staff turn over was very high, which made work more difficult at times. Many of the co-workers I had were friendly, but there were some brief issues with previous employees who chose to not follow rules and code of conduct. Over-all it is not a bad place to work, but not and ideal location to stay at for a career."
good,I have learnt a lot of things in this organisation like time management and also get a chance to work with different colleagues.
good,"elke dag was anders je weet nooit wat de dag je brengt,"
good,Enjoyable to learn the different problems for an office equipment.  Clients are thankful and appreciative on the quick response we provide.  Every day is a new one and each client has their different needs met. The downside is the 2 year wait as a contractor before switching over as direct hire with all the benefits and salary increase.
good,"A typical day in a call center environment requires me sign into my computer and work telephone and assist medicare members via incoming calls. I receive the privilege of learning to handle high call volumes and work at a steady pace while provide accurate and reliable services to medicare members. Management provides an open door policy, where I am able to speak with any available individual in the management position about any issues or concern that I may experience. I am honored to have experienced and reliable co workers that are will to work together ,when necessary, to complete a work task. The hardest part of my job is taking on the responsibility of handling an individual health insurance benefit and the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work diligently  to make sure their issues are resolved."
good,"Passion for what I do, accompanied by an intense desire to steer my career in the right direction, makes me as determined and hardworking as they come. A can do attitude wakes me up in the mornings, and a strong work ethic/positive attitude gets me through a day at Xerox."
good,"Unstable, imposible to plan a day's workflow, sometimes 14 hour days, the following day 5 hrs, without prior notice, No room for improvement or advance with company, Otherwise nice environment, quiet, fast paced, nice people to enjoy the free time of day."
good,"high call volume, lots of dissatisfied customers, I learned that sam's club and wally world are cutthroat companies, management were treated terribly, co-workers were druggies, hardest part of the job was knowing policies were wrong but you can't help, I enjoyed leaving daily"
good,"good for freshers, lot can be learn.promotion depends upon the time period of 2yrs not before that"
good,This company has its up's and downs. Its all what you make it there
good,"I remain at my current employment because I am 100% remote, not all positions can be remote, but it is moving in that direction. Xerox purchased ACS, for the datacenter outsourcing and business outsourcing ACS performed."
good,Busy friendly environment. Flexible schedule.Co-workers pleasure to work with.
good,"We process the Fafsa, Signature Page and Sars in order for students acquire financial aid.  The internet is replacing our job positions."
good,"I loved helping customers, troubleshooting their problems, but it was hard when management was not so hard on us little people."
good,"Working with Xerox was very good.  Great people, great products, very structured and it was a great experience for me.  I assisted the sales staff in selling high end production equipment to major accounts and government entities."
good,Not bad to start out a business career.  Get first hand customer service experience. Poor upper management.
good,I wouldn't recommend Xerox as a place of employment. They demand mandatory OT all the time and at the last minute. Their bonuses aren't paid consistently on time. They expect you to take 50+ calls everyday.
good,"Trabalho com processos de diversas áreas que acrescentou no meu aprendizado, com suporte da gestão, trabalhar em equipe, traçar metas e objetivos, alcançar metas e objetivos."
good,"Xerox had a dedicated hardworking group of people"
good,"A typical day is signing in and being able to answer 1100 calls every month, which is about 60 calls per day in a 9 hour day. Most of the time is customers wanting to pay their bill or have their bill explained to them. Occasionally you will have some wanting credits for items such as long distance calls or overages on their data, minutes or texts, depending on what plan they are on. The goal is to not give credits but find a better plan that will fit the customer's needs and to retain their service with them. "
good,"Management were helpful and apporachable.  The contract was secured with a reliable client.  Co-workwers got along, good morale overall."
good,There are rules and not enough stability. Co-workers are nice.  The job is pretty good.  Learn something new everyday.
good,"I worked there for 5 years, under a few different contracts. If you apply in Bakersfield, make sure you apply to the SFA division and not boost mobile. The boost mobile contract was strict, and you only got 7 min of ""bathroom time', no time for making notes on a call, and you were treated really badly. The SFA division is not great, but it is better than the boost mobile/virgin mobile contracts. There are some good supervisors at the SFA division. However, the pay is not great...no raises, and there is always some excuse as to why. After 4 years, my income had not changed at all. none of ours had. It was a ""freeze"" on raises. New hires would come in with a starting wage higher than people that had served the company for 10 years. But I made a lot of good friends there, good people."
good,"I adore my co-workers... while Xerox offers limited advancement, I have had an opportunity to learn and grow within my current position. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, both the ones I speak to and the ones I work along side."
good,"Answering large volume of inbound calls for US Cellular customers"
good,"Typical call center environment, things could be better within management and ethics"
good,"A typical day at work is sitting constantly talking to people who half the time are ridiculously angry at Verizon and take it out on you. I learned that you fake it 'til you make it because for the first few weeks you really know nothing. Management is actually decent for the most part. My supervisor is - and most supervisors are - really nice. You don't really talk much to your co-workers because you're too busy talking to customers, but when you're in a pinch and your supervisor - although nice - doesn't really know anything, nor how to say it properly to a customer, they help you out. The hardest part of the job is that even though you're sitting on your butt all day, you get so ridiculously exhausted! It's very emotionally draining trying to help and empathize with about… 40 different people a day. The most enjoyable part of the job is break, lunch, and that - as of right now anyway - my family and I don't starve."
good,This job is ok.  The management is not the best. They have a lot of favoritism. They can be unprofessional as well.
good,"Call center work with billing and technical support for clients. "
good,The tasks and job were great and challenging. Satisfaction with a job well done. Unfortunately management was fixated on a corporate climb and appearances were to the detriment of the work and workers.
good,"A good paying job. There aren't many options for advancement, Management is bad."
good,"Operador de produção - Trabalho no planejamento de serviços e relacionamento com clientes, propondo inovações tecnológicas (equipamentos, materiais, processos); tendo atribuições de tarefas como controle de estoque, fechamento de produção, manutenção e calibração das maquinas de operação de produção e logística, com abastecimento de materiais."
good,I learned how to review a customers billing and charges.The most difficult part of the day would be having charges that were billed correctly still being disputed by the customer.
good,"Answering a lot of phone calls, be ready to have your helping hat on."
good,Average company nothing bad but nothing spectacular either
good,Not a lot of staff.  The plant was brand new and hired contract workers.  Forced to pay union dues with no representation.  All workers degreed but made significantly less than fellow union employees across the fleet.  Could not stay clean and never got work gear.
good,"I've worked for Xerox for about 8 months now, and its an okay place to work, the hours are usually 40 a week, but the company will cut you down to 32 because they don't want to pay the extra 8 hours"
good,"Learned all aspects of Technology(Networking, Desktop support, Servers, etc.)"
good,"Fast-paced work environment. Limited advancement opportunities. Must be patient, thick skinned and skilled in Human Wisdom to survive the culture. Above all if you have the above mentioned qualities and self-motivated, life in this team oriented environment could be enjoyable at this particular work site."
good,"No one really makes money there. A lot of people there get failed surveys, but are only following policies and procedures. If a customer that is irate ends up getting the survey and rep did all they could to resolve the issue, and still get a failed survey, there's always some weird reason as to why they don't want to dispute it, whether you didn't utilize all your sources, or you didn't offer them enough credits, your work and effort isn't good enough. The breaks are only ten minutes, not 15 minutes."
good,"if you are in desperate need this is the job for you. Its not ideal if you are looking for something where you can have a life and do other things like school, or church"
good,This is an ok place to work if you are just starting out with a first time job.  The advancement is quick if you hold the soft skills to handle phone calls and are able to relate to the customers.
good,"it was a pleasure working there the 1st 6 yrs"
good,"What started out as a great company back in the day has now turned into a place riddled with fear.  Everything is being outsourced, it was getting harder to know what your exact role would be from day to day.  The most enjoyable part was the flexible work hours and the casual dress.  Management here is ok."
good,"Employment with Xerox was an all around great experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the ability to genuinely assist our customers in making idealy life changing decisions. What people endure commuting to maintain stability for their households is nothing short of chaotic mishap, our daily goals were to assist in account activation/maintenance, payment processing, program enrollment. The hardest part of the job is not being able to clear some customers who are really bad off, company protocol stands firm. Co-workers were really pleasant and almost family-like. Management--well, you're there to do a job. Management is rarely seen and isn't as hands on as the supervisory staff. Open door policy is present, but laxed. Overall review-Great environment, with the right individuals in place and organization; not one employee would want to leave."
good,"While this contract has a lot of room to grow, they can improve on many levels."
good,"The management is constantly changing and could do better with communicating with the employees"
good,"Provided answers to clients by identifying problems"
good,"A TYPICAL DAY AT WORK:"
good,"The company prides itself on an innovative approach to pay however the system is slanted against employees, on the up side they do offer benefits and overtime on a regular basis. All in all not a bad place to gain some experience."
good,"I've been working at Xerox for over a month now, and so far I'm still not sure what to make of it - I'm on the Xbox Project. One of the trainers I do feel came up extremely short, and there are several co-workers of mine that I still feel are a walking HR nightmare, although upper and middle management does not seem to care about that."
good,"While working at Xerox Corporation (formerly known as ACS Computer Services), I started with retirement benefits and had the opportunity to perform many functions on Xeroxes' new business in HR Outsourcing Solutions. "
good,This is a great place to work for those interested in travel industry.
good,This company is probably one of the most non professional careers i have ever had.
good,"Read through my emails, only business no private mail allowed, look at my planning for the next day that I did the day before. Identify the matters that required urgent attendance, and attend to them. Go past all work stations to make sure everyone is on part with what needs to be done. During the course of the day of the day check if there are new tasks that needed to be completed the same day, or bulk deliveries to customers. I run a warehouse from the floor and not the office. Depending on the amount of containers that we receive, I stay until they are offloaded to ensure we don’t pay for overnight charges. Whatever admin and planning I didn’t get through I take home. I dial into the network from work, run backorder etc. I don’t really take tea time I only drink water and on occasion a cool drink. I have my lunch if I remember to eat whilst I am replying to email etc. make sure to thank my staff on a daily base and also to go and greet them in person, and find out if everything is all good with them. It creates a happy environment."
good,"Over the past thirteen years, I have obtained many skills which would effectively translate into many other workplaces in a number of industries.  I have effectively collaborated with both processing associates and management and have become the ""go-to guy"" for numerous projects, as assigned by the chief site manager.  I think that throughout my career at ACS/Xerox, I have proven myself to be a loyal and conscientious employee and hope to obtain a position where I can grow."
good,"A typical day at Xerox is always fast paced.  Xerox's policy is about being the most efficient with as little as possible, which gives the employees plenty of opportunity to learn about many different departments.  The hardest part of the job is the stress of taking on many different projects and not having enough time to complete basic job functions.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people."
good,"Too much work for the money, no growth, you can't even turn your cell phone on, yet you repair cell phones."
good,I learned a great deal about medicare rules and regulations and processing claims for medicare part d members. Most days I take from 80-100 calls from pharmacists and doctors adjudicating rejected claims
good,Working at Xerox I learned a lot and met a lot of nice people.  The job requirements were more than the pay.  I was there for 3 years and only got one raise and that was because another company was merging with Xerox and Xerox had to meet there base pay.
good,"Working at Xerox can be enjoyable if you are able to stay separate from others and not involve yourself in others drama. It is hard to do, but you can grow if you do your job right and stay focused."
good,"This is a great job for those with little job history. You will be paid a basic $9/hour for doing a basic job. The management does a great job at providing information and support. If you are used to having more freedom on the job to make decisions, this job may frustrate you."
good,"I appreciate my job, in this economy, wish that they were more organized and clear to the employees their business strategies."
good,"Call center service representative for Verizon Wireless customers.  Very busy place with almost daily changes being made to what and how things were handled.  Involved great knowledge of the latest wireless phones, their programming and operation.  Questions concerning billing, service and ever other aspect of wireless telephones was addressed in this position."
good,"The Xerox corp. was excellent in providing employment, keeping me updated with policy and benefits, and with wages. The site I worked for was contracted to work for Express Scripts Inc. More or less I was an Express Scripts employee. Every day was the exact same, members had the typical array of issues and concerns across the board based upon their benefits and Express Scripts policies and actions. You were required to work every day, except the weekends or unless you had approved time off; they afforded three hours of PTO each bi-weekly pay period. The management on the site was lacking yet also superlative depending on your team's manager. There were, of course, high and low points just like in any job. The hardest part of the position was having to repeatedly, on a very consistent basis, deliver bad or troubling news while educating members. This was more difficult for some, but I could relay this information in a personal and helpful sense to successfully calm and ease the member. When the member was truly grateful for your assistance, that would be the most pleasing part. "
good,management needs improvement to reach employees potenial
good,"Answer phones for members"
good,"Answer inbound customer service calls. Assist customers with their bills, apply payments, and make any necessary changes on their accounts. Answer questions and calm angry customers."
good,The ability to telecommute is a great option. No possibility to advance my career. Haven't had a raise in years.
good,I take great satisfaction in the job that I have done. This is a contract based job and the contract is ending and I will be laid off. I will miss the management and my co-workers.
good,I worked customer service all day also using the computers as my main resource to enter data and pull up needed information. I learned how proficiently use computer databases such as Sabre in order to complete my job functions. I had a management team that worked hard to make sure I was able to provide the best service by giving me direct feed back and coaching.    
good,"A decent place to work, but management can interact with their employees more."
good,"It was a hectic job however we the employees tried to make it a fun environment, as they say satisfaction begins within the company with us first. My job was to ensure that i solve the customers issues and provide the best solution to their problems. I worked for Kobo company Customer service. They have the kobo eReaders and the website for their customers to buy ebooks as well as non kobo ereader holders could get those books on their devices as well. My job was to answer calls help them to add books, delete books or purchase books on their device and keep track of their library.Management was lacking as they were not considerate of the employees at all. The hardest part of the job was trying to assist the customers as best we could with little resources given to us by management. Most enjoyable part is when the customers are happy especially when i come up with a plan that worked on my own."
good,It was alright. High inbound call center. So you get what you think it will be. lol
good,"In this job you deal with people from all over the world. You learn how to build rap ore and to be empathetic of the customer needs. The management is very helpful, coworkers are friendly and help cheer you up when you are feeling down. The hardest part of the jobs is sitting for long periods of time, the most enjoyable part of the job is you get to talk to people from all over the world."
good,Helping customers with their medication delivery is fun I enjoy speaking to different people every day. There are just to many young people here that reall do no take employment seriously. I have to put on a smile even though it is alot of chaos here.
good,"I believe that if An individual is Having some kind of problem and its consistent, Management should set up a specific training class just for that specific issue. instead of giving warning and then final. by doing so they will lose more employees."
good,"Acompanhar a produção, gestão de estoque, liderança da equipe.A parte mais agradável do trabalho era a equipe de trabalho e a mais dificil era o relacionamento com o cliente externo, pois, estava sendo desmerecendo a trabalho da Xerox."
good,I overall loved the challenge of helping people while working for xerox. my supervisor was great and i enjoyed over the phone interaction. very structured and you never had to worry about hours.
good,"Love my job and the people with whom I work. Xerox has a pretty good home/life balance. Hardest part of job is being remote, which is also the best part of the job."
good,6 days a week for six months was all I could do live and I didn't enough to cover rent and have transportation. I was exhausted and they wanted to make me manager...
good,Pay rate per pieces completed was a real joke... almost impossible to get paid beyond minimum wage...if my managers were not the hard working individuals they turned out to be would have quit way sooner
good,"O patrão não sabe organizar o dinheiro q entra, não comprava mercadorias para a loja"

good,"Por ser meu primeiro emprego,foi bom pra mim por poder ganhar experiência profissional. Sempre tive uma boa conduta com meus colegas de emprego, e, por lidar com universitários aprendi como me portar com o público."
good,"Xerox is a nice place, however, they do not follow their own policies most of the time."
good,If I enjoyed sitting all day I would love this job. I start my day taking calls and processing documents for cilents. I have learned a lot about goverment benefits. Hardest par tof the job is sitting in one place all day. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help others.
good,"Policy and procedures didn't seem to focus on company bottom line financial growth Or serving customer's best interest. I hope its made changes and improvements. Employees are clearly under valued, and over worked."
good,A tipical work day is stressful but its fun its challeging ive learned paticence the mangers are nice and very helpful my coworkers are helpful theharderst part of my job is wheni am unable t assist the mm and the most enjoyable part is when ive helped them and they are happy.
good,A typical day at work consisted of helping people with Medicare Part D.
good,I enjoy helping customer and resolving their issues from start to finish. A Happy customer is a Happy business.
good,"El ambiente de trabajo y el compañerismo es magnífico. Por el contrario, los salarios son bajos y las oportunidades de promoción escasas."
good,"Most of my coworkers were fun and I know they would all agree that the management needs improvement, they walk around the place as if they were kings and queens and most of the time treated coworkers and me, who were on the phones, like dirt and beneath them. There was also more negativity then positive. For example, if one of us failed a survey that was based off of a customers emotions that particular day, and we did everything we could to help the customer out, management would look for the bad parts of the call rather then the good parts of the call and our pay was effected greatly based upon the surveys. Most supervisors were good, but a lot of them lacked communication skills with the teams. I'm not going to lie, I did learn a lot of useful information, such as how to handle someone who was upset, how to find a solution to any problem, learned a lot of math dealing with bills. I had a blast meeting and learning differnt things about differnt people everyday. I enjoyed what I did on the phones, but the environment with which I worked, was very stressful."
good,"Benefits are average, compensation is good in todays environment"
good,"This job provides great experience for future jobs. This is a very educational job and I am able to take some things from this job that I can utilize in the future, based off what I have been trained to do and learn."
good,use to spend most time with corporate clients
good,I enjoyed my last account a typical days was fun and interesting. Every day was a learning experience. My co-workers were as a whole supportive. I like to work with different people and I enjoyed that alot. I like to help people out.
good,"I deal with customers on a 1 to 1 basis. My co-worker and I try to make it fun. If I have a concern I always try to figure out what I can do to help the customer and if not I find the solution another way. The hardest part of the job is trying to take care of all the customers at the same time. The most enjoyable is when the customers are very happy with the way their jobs turned out,"
good,I worked for Xerox for almost 9 years. I have learned a lot from this company and hated to see my time end with Xerox. My position was outsourced to Jamaica.
good,- Know your assignment and get straight to it
good,"Great company to work for 20 years ago, there was security and a awesome company to retire from. Merit increases were good and then the economy got bad and the company started doing pay-cuts and letting older people go in the last few years. No security with the job anymore."
good,"I worked as a supervisor with 32 different accounts in which we provided onsite services such as Copying, Faxing pick up and delivery and mail pick up and delivery."
good,a typical day at work would be a long drawn out unenjoyable day. I learned how to operate sprints systems. Management was okay but could do better in appearance to employees. The hardest part of the job would be sitting at your desk taking calls for and exceptionally long time. Nothing about the job was enjoyable
good,"The environment here has continued the downward slide as upper management leads the company into the “services business” with everything being outsourced. RD&E spend continues to drop and the plans are to eliminate it. This isn’t the place if you are in research, development, or engineering."
good,"Odd that only certain people are promoted, even after promises are made to others. You need to be a friend of higher management to get ahead or just be able to play the game very well."
good,Loved learning all I could about the health care industry. Found myself wanting to become an expert at my job so I could effectively and consistently assist our members with their problems.
good,NO other place I've worked at has allowed its employees to come in to work in their pajamas with as little grooming as they do. Several coworkers did not shower and their stench was nauseating.
good,Fresher's can start their career in Xerox. It is easy to get job in there. For commerce students it will be more useful to grow up their career. And also job opportunities will be more.
good,"Xerox has a habit of getting rid incompetent management so you have some managers that are absolutely flawless and others that are completely ignorant, violate employee rights according to Xerox policy and will not teach or discipline them to be better.  This makes no sense?"
good,"A typical day at work is you take calls, and try and convince customers to fix their issue over the phone, but still keeping good customer service. I pretty much didnt learn alot, just how to fix some issues. Management is somewhat horrible, they accept you to ""negotiate"" with customers when to place service calls and when not to. which in the end, doesnt work in your favor if youre not good at negotiating"
good,working for xerox was one of the only jobs i have had that there was minimal or very hard to advance at. it was hard to manage team with all the dealines they gave
good,"A typical day included taking between 20-35 calls from customers asking about their accounts, everything from billing questions to services offered, to device upgrade eligibility."
good,"Filing papers away throughout the day and help others, if they are falling behind at all. Keeping a regular pace. working on the computers to file all useful documents to the next people in line for insurance."
good,"I worked as a Customer Service Rep for 3 years out of LA South..Their attention was focused solely on themselves because they were 'XEROX' and not about the new equipment coming out from competitors..The company stayed with Original equipment that was old, large and slow not producing new state of the art products..Everyday I would see new, more versatile machines by other companies being sold at office buildings thru out  my territory..Problem was Xerox had nothing to compete with it..Cheaper, smaller, faster with comparable quality they had but Xerox was old trying to seem new..Management didn't have a clue of what was going on outside of their offices and it caught up to them..Snooze and you lose and XEROX LOST !!..It was a Great company to work for but kept blaming others for their own failures..I wish them well but doubt  if their lack of understanding the outside world will change..The world is moving way too fast and Xerox is it's own boat anchor..The end is near, very very near..Just Saying !!"
good,nice place to work but ran out of work to do    just sat in the office waiting for a service call  some days none came in  was boring most days nothing else to say
good,Started out amazing then turned at year 2 when the company was bought out by Xerox. Very busy job and engaging. I was able to hire over 300 people and also train an assistant for me.
good,"I was in between jobs and needed something quickly. The turn over rate is high. They paid well ($12 hr) for 6 weeks of training. If you MADE IT through training, you got pay raise (there were bonuses too). If you can handle ""boot camp"" (taking live calls for the first time while being monitored), you'll probably be fine out on the floor. At the time, our client was Sprint cellular. I have anxiety and depression, and was not cut out for taking calls all day, especially because of the mental and emotional abuse the customers put you through. Aside from the mental breakdowns, the hours were good and the pay was great!"
good,"Empresa que enfrenta grandes desafios devido às alterações constantes em termos de estrutura impostas pela sede."
good,Xerox was actually one of the most progressive places I've worked as far as equal treatment of all and in all of the training it provided to it's employees - way ahead of it's time - what it didn't give in Salary was partially offset in training. Was a good stepping-stone job - that I stayed in for 13 years.
good,"I worked for Xerox 20+ years and enjoyed the experience."
good,"A typical day at work started with logging into the phone system (Oracle) and taking inbound calls from interested customers. I've learned about Capital Credit cards and gained more customer service experience. Management wasn't the greatest, but they showed up. The hardest part was dealing with irate customers. The fun part was being able to go home early."
good,"Team-oriented, limited job progression prospects.  Good place to get a starter job to leverage into a better job elsewhere."
good,"A company who does not respect their employees, unfortunately a sinking ship with poorly managed service and sales decisions, not recommended unless as a starting career."
good,With the most recent changes in leadership the company is no longer a place where folks want to be.  Bad environment with most looking for another job
good,"It is a place to earn a paycheck. Very restrictive environment to work in, driven by production goals, an aged building with little outside light and recirculated air where people are constantly ill. Cubicle style work stations. Steady work and the people were nice. Made some great friends in management and also in co-workers."
good,Training was cool cause they showed us what screens we were to be on to help the customer but after trading and you were left alone to handle situations you wld be repremainded if you didn't make sales
good,"Xerox takes on contracts for other big companies for example Apple, Blue Cross Blue Shield and others.  This is very entry level IT support and Sales.  Great for getting your foot in the door but not to work permantanely"
good,"Good place to work. Provide some reimbursement for college tuition. Have a create work/family balance. Can work remotely when necessary. Paid for my PMP training, the exam, and certificate renewal."
good,company is changing. New leadership with new go to market strategy. many workers are considering retiring. new technology is very good. security of equipment is a big advantage.
good,"Xerox Business Services, LLC (now Conduent Services) had a great structure and culture, but needs to be followed more consistently. Although employees are recognized; promotions are rare and merit increases have been frozen for nearly five years."
good,"The Xerox office went through a transition for Call Center experience team with Conduent. This Fortune 500 company was exceptional in many ways but I feel that more hands on with employees should have been implemented. Overall it was a good company,  but too many managment changes up to Directors in charge."
good,"during the last 30 years, I learned how to work with other lead projects and deliver results. Working on a culture that needs to communicate constantly."
good,nce a great company now fair with all the downsizing occuring.  Benefits are expensive and we went many years without a salary increase.   Job security is awful.   Layoffs occurring 4-5 times a year.  No one is safe.
good,You have your own desk with computer (shared between shifts). You take incoming calls from customers who need help with basic troubleshooting for their phone or have questions about their bills.
good,Working at Xerox gave me opportunities to lead and manage.  Support and direction from management was limited which made it difficult to get staffing balanced for the required workload.
good,"pay raises were always difficult to get, yet they always wanted you to go above and beyond and give great customer service..so you work hard and give great service and come pay increase time, well no raises this year"
good,"They keep you busy and see if they don’t push you too hard, you get the right tools and materials to do your job have decent benefits unforanatly the place is getting smaller all the time which makes advancement almost impossible"
good,La posibilidad de venta de la empresa a nivel mundial es muy cierta y genera incertidumbre
good,To be efficient as required  by the employer required. Performance good skills with my duties. respectul with co-workers  and supervisors. Do my best at work.
good,there were some people that i worked with that loved coming in to work everyday. it may have possibly been that a call center just wasnt my cup of tea. but when my husband deployed and then my daughter was born i was not upset to be becoming a stay at home mom.
good,"Relaxed work environment, poor employee moral, no pay increases. No room for advancement, flexible hours, paid sick and vacation. You are just another employee, lack of human compassion, management was poor."
good,very stressful because of all the work we have. xerox is a company in transition. the future isnt looking to bright. the days of service technicians at xerox is slowly coming to an end
good,"The culture right now is hard at Xerox.  There is a lot of unknown in the company.   However, Xerox has been a great place to work over the years.  They believe in promotion and Employee improvement.   I have learned many different systems and applications on the job, and overall have enjoyed and been proud to work for Xerox."
good,"Xerox used to be a fun company with decent perks.  Due to all the changes and challenges (possible merger, mature product, less time and money spent on employee development), it is not a great time to work there.  For the most part I liked the people and clients, and working remotely was great."
good,Xerox was a great company. The Originations segment of Xerox was often fun and very flexible.  The diversity at this company was one of the best I have seen.
good,"When I was first hired, it was a fantastic place to work. Senior management was very innovative and open to new ideas and was implementing a new stream of business that was less ""selling a box"" oriented and more ""service"" oriented. I was part of that implementation. But as with all corporations, senior management changed, and with it, the vision. I and others in my department were now seen as liabilities. The business downturn that followed the recession of 2008 and early 2009 was the final straw, and massive layoffs resulted. I was one of the casualties."
good,"The people are generally honest and hard working, but the company seems to be in financial decline.  Valiant efforts are being made to drive the company forward, but the pressure on the financials is hard to live with from day to day."
good,"Incentives are provided for those who meet their metrics however, because half the company was receiving bonuses, metrics were changed to were it is almost impossible to meet."
good,I feel they need to provide extreme training and internet service for their Customer Service training of site.  Never got the opportunity to continue working for them.  I just go into the training mode.
good,"A typical day at work can be a very busy day. Supporting all the services offered at my location can be time consuming.  Over my time working for Xerox I learned docucare, print production, mailing services, and gained leadership skills."
good,"also great ppl but to me favoritism runs a call center, and too me at this one was exactly that, but other wise, got to meet amazing ppl and made amazing friends"
good,This is a good position for a young person to start off. The hiring process is fast and pretty easy to get through. I wouldn't say it is anything glamorous but definitely a step up from fast food.
good,I worked at Xerox for 7 years. I did not feel agents were compensated fairly for the jobs they did. The company was always looking for ways to cut costs or to not have to pay their employees what they are entitled to. Always got the run around with hiring agents out of state. Just not a very good company to work for.
good,The company is a nice place to work and the environment. It's definitely in a local area where you can go shopping and a lot of eating areas. Its fun and very laid back
good,"The administrative system I used for benefit plan administration was developed in the 1980s.  As a result, a lot of other work-arounds were needed.  I cannot vouch for operations in other areas."
good,"The position was exciting, meeting and interacting with the customer.  However my last manager was a micro manager that did not know the job, and would belittle you everychance she got"
good,The people in the trenches are great to work with overall and will go above and beyond for each other and the customers but constant reorganization and badly communicated change makes everyone uneasy.  We all know that layoffs can happen at any time.  It seems like cuts are made by upper management saying I don't care if you are understaffed or only have one resource who knows this you still have to cut x heads. As a result there are gaps in knowledge and a lot of work for the remaining people.
good,"Située à Asnières pour son Business Center, Xerox offre avec ces locaux un environnement de travail agréable."
good,The work is good for someone to start their work life or to work while their child or children are in school.  Would be better if I did not have the knowledge and responsibilities that I have.
good,"As a job just out of school this was a decent way to get a paycheck at the expense of some aggravated customers, and a good way to determine if you want to go to college to get a better career. If you do work here you will need a thick skin and way to deal with stress."
good,This position require you to answer the phones and answer questions that a customer would have about their health insurance. Sometime you could satisfy the customer with the correct answers and other times you would have to transfer them to someone else over you and hope that the answer would be solved.
good,typical union manufacturing shop.  good company benefits and compensation. limited opportunities for advancement.  overall a good company to work for.
good,"Worked for over 6 years. Good environment, fun people to work with. Slow career advancement and pay wasn't that good. Had a good experience. Overall will recommend it to a friend."
good,This xerox that I am reviewing is a telecommunication company in Jamaica. It was all about customer service for different companies .....................
good,With this job a typical day consisted of arriving at least 15 to 20 mins early just to login to computer. Then you immediately started taking calls.  The most inbound calls I took in one day was 142.  Continually on phone 2 10 min breaks and if you were late you would get a repremand then written correction and one 30 min break.  The pace was so stressful that I had to get on meds. Management changed like underware. The hiring process was easy and the turn over rate was aweful.  They are always hiring due to the lack of employee appreciation. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home.  Anyone who has common sence and can type and computer skills can get hired.  Just a transitional job.
good,Innovative and results focused in a relaxed setting. Management team trusted individual contributers and was generally hands-off and rewarded good results.
good,If Xerox provided a more definite schedule the job would have been better for me.I have small children and the company could not work with me as a single mother .
good,a normal call center job with little to no career advancement opportunities. Career advancement is bases off of popularity rather than skill and experience
good,The work was fine it was management that made me leave I’d go back if asked really enjoyed it there. The phones were always busy and I loved the overtime when needed
good,managed high speed production and shipping areas with union and non union employees.trained in time management .safety quality and measured dailey.Over wheling admin dutuies
good,It was alright if you are into working at a call center for bad pay.  I worked good hours 6:00-2:30 and my supervisor was really cool.  It is actually a pretty good job if you are into working at a cal center for not much pay.
good,"Never did I think that I had to ask a company if they gave even cost of living increases when I applied.  It has been over 3.5 years and no one gets a cost of living increase, never mind a bonus?!  Promotions are cherry picked, and even they don't get pay increases.  When we get together quarterly, we have to bring our own food and drink, and do not get compensated for travel.  The only reason we all stay is that we get to work remotely.  My career has stalled, my group gets very little visibility, and I hope to not die in this role."
good,Good basic sales training. From then it all depends on your managers and how they continue to train you. Very competitive market. There's not much room for advancement.
good,great for people that work well under high stress. also that are good with time managment. The training period is perfect they made me feel completly comfortable with going out on to the floor!
good,"You will succeed if you can maintain established metrics set by the client. Once you become Supervisor, the challenge becomes achieving your team metrics without burning yourself out. Maintaining that work-family balance can be tough, but achievable. Being an agent can be challenging because of the inconsistent hours. Either you have mandatory overtime of get sent home early because of low call volume."
good,"they are down sizing and losing accounts every week, the managers are not trained to do the work they should be doing,and extra help is not avaible to get certain jobs done on time."
good,"I took the position in hopes my skills and knowledge would be fully utilized, I took the position thinking I'd be part of a true productive environment, wasn't always the case."
good,"Poorly managed, supervisor favoritism, company needs was put last, and advocates lead were put last. Team were not educated properly on process and procedure to be successful at work. Individual struggle due to inconstancy within management and organization causing moral to dip low."
good,"Most of the workers were temps, and then they just laid them all off to pay for the $20 Million raise the CEO gave her self."
good,"I was thankful to be able to build a long career at Xerox.  The work was quite demanding and stressful, but I was able to relocate due to health and be close to family, while working remotely."
good,"This job gave me the experience I needed to pursue the job I'm currently at. The attendance policy was not good, point system. Mandatory overtime during peek seasons. Most enjoyable part of the job was the friends made, other than that it wasn't enjoyable."
good,"Xerox has been my home for almost 4 years. It has given me a lot of opportunities and helped me grow professionally. It has a good working environment, very accessible, less traffic. The people are all very nice."
good,"Xerox is contracted with Apple for sales, support, and tech support."
good,"This is one of the biggest call centers in the Madison County area, the have many different job oppurtunities and advancement in the company. If you have good communication skills,"
good,I am hired to work for the company in support of another. Not a temp to hire but Xerox or Conduent as it is now employs me and others to work for their contracted company.
good,"A typical day of work required some flexibility in the daily workload.  The workload was dependent upon the orders placed for equipment.  I learned some minor repair of copier/printer equipment.  I how to install mainboards, memory, fax cards, UI displays, etc, in the copier/printer equipment.  We were required to learn and use proprietary software which programmed the copiers/printers.  Also, I had to sometimes manually enter information/ and upgraded equipment.  The workplace culture could at times be stressful and fast-paced, but over all was relaxed.  The hardest part of the job was the overtime.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with other fellow co-workers."
good,"Amazing people to work with but high stress  and emotional draining environment. "
good,Fuji Xerox used to be the leader in digital printing and a fun company to work for however lately the printing industry has been declining due to the digital revolution so Xerox is trying to evolve to become a solution company managing enterprises electronic documents
good,Culture of frequent change and currently refocused on technology and related services after spin off of its BPO business which will increase its chances of success in a very competitive market
good,"You began on a 6 month campaign with high pay and no benefits. If hired on after, pay drops by a few dollars and you begin receiving benefits. It's a job that can work long or short term if you work it."
good,"Lots of incentives , very chilled environment, the work insitives are great its a great company and if you work hard you can be moved to a hire potion within 6 months after hitting the floors"
good,The last CEO lost billions of dollars in equity in this company in her management years.  A failed acquisition is what she will be remembered for.  It will be VERY difficult for the new CEO to pull this company back from the brink. It is my understanding that the company is continually laying off between 200-300 people per month so as not to hit the news.  The company is also selling everything they can that is not tied down to avoid not being profitable or hitting their targets for a single quarter.  This method will only last so long and will eventually be seen for what it is....a sinking ship in a declining industry.
good,"The company is not what it used to be. I have worked here for 30 years and we do not get the perks we used to. These perks have slowly disappeared through the years. It is basically just a paycheck, which is fine but it would be nice to go back to the days of bonuses, parties, and R&R."
good,"Xerox is a shadow of its former self, a once great company. Job security is non existent in the current business climate.  The trend is downward and best to find work elsewhere that may provide some modicum of security."
good,"good company, freedom of ideas, innovations, new ventures, US xerox better than any other division.."
good,A awesome workday to me consist of a productive and hard workday but at the same time phone and not feeling like you are in a hostile environment. of course the best part of a job is a paycheck but also the people you get to meet along the way that make the workplace a better place to keep coming back everyday.
good,Be ready to work hard and figure things out on your own. But remember the pay is steady and overtime is always available. Training is about 8 weeks and they have additional training through tout the time your there. They really hire anybody!
good,"The rate of pay was good, overall the job it self was alright but I wouldn't go back for anything. It was to many people trying to do others job, some people are rude helping also."
good,"Making calls, taking calls. Work independently, manage own portfolio, when monies were suppose to come in they did not, I had to start making calls back to the companies again.  Everything is a learning experience.  We become a family to one another."
good,"Xerox is contracted by Sprint to sell their products and services. It is a call center environment. Everything you do is watched.You're required to make a sales offer on every call no matter what it's about or how angry the customer is..,and sometimes they can get downright nasty. You're required to balance several different metrics like transfer rates, call duration, and customer satisfaction and pay is just above minimum wage. Depending on which supervisor you have, there is little to no support. The equipment and software likes to quit working. They are discriminatory to those of the LGBT community and most likely will not promote you because of it. Policy updates are frequent and often poorly communicated."
good,Need all new management.  If management would take the time to listen to employees and learn about the job and not just think they know what the job in tales then it would run smoother.
good,The location and coworkers are great. They definitely work with you to try to help customers have a great experience. The down side is that there is a unique type of stress that comes with this job. If you can handle subtle verbal abuse from a faceless person who doesn't care about your mental health then this job is for you.
good,can be discussed if am short list :) I believe i am looking for something to get out the comfort zone as what am currently doing is not challenging for me anymore.
good,"Being called in at $16.51 per hour for a few months was OK for the first couple of Project Assignments for client companies' Annual enrollment, but after almost a year of yo-yo, working 2-3 months, laid off for 2 months, etc. it got pretty old. It was good work experience, but disappointing in that there seemed to hardly be any permanent employment opportunities. The trainers were great! I had one good manager for two of my 5 assignments, won't mention the other three. "
good,"I was with the company for almost 5 years, they do not give merit raises, so new employees were paid at the same rate.  "
good,Xerox is not a dependable company because there are too many companies contracted with Xerox. One company or department may be with Xerox today and gone tomorrow. Constant turnover.
good,"Loved the hours, the work and the pay. Just didn't like being laidoff right before they were supposed to make you permanent for each project. Layoffs came randomly sometimes in the middle of the workday. Otherwise I enjoyed everything else"
good,The job is good if you're just trying to get your foot in the call center/ customer service door. It has a high turn over rate which is why they're always hiring.
good,"Xerox is in a flat to declining industry; therefore, it is constantly going through large organizational changes and maintaining profitability by cutting expenses."
good,"Leuk werk voor tijdelijk. Maar betaald slecht, 0-uren contract en werkuren zijn erg wisselend."
good,"Je bent een klantendienst medewerker en moet targets behalen op het gebied van snel behandelen, klanttevredenheid enz,"
good,"Leaders and managers were always hired from outside the company vs. promoting internally.  "
good,"the pay could've been more competitive, "
good,"A normal day would include, showing up to work at least 15minutes early just sign on to program and be ready​ to take calls when start time is scheduled. Due to high turnover rate overtime was normally mandatory."
good,"It was an okay company to work for.. management needs some work. It gets the bills paid and they have over time so that's good,  just wouldn't see myself there forever."
good,Era un lugar de buen ambiente laboral. De poca estabilidad laboral
good,Overall a good workplace. Fellow employees very helpful and easy to get along with. Management was flexible with my scheduling needs. Some of the company policies could use another look. Felt safe in the building when working alone late at night.
good,Very easy and flexible. Learned a lot over the years. Good training programs. The workplace culture is very diverse. The hardest part of the job is old systems not updated.
good,"Xerox has not figured out how to stop the revenue bleeding, year after year;  their only answer has been to keep cutting costs and laying off great people.  Unsustainable business model."
good,"Proche de toute commodités, il était façile de se rendre à son poste de travail sans grandes difficultées."
good,24 hour Corporation.  Hours are scattered.  No set Schedule. Training is very well placed but once you start on the phones...it is non stop calls.  Its all INBOUND calls.
good,"While it is a Fortune 500 company, the benefits offered to employees are sub-par compared to similar positions within the industry and each year the benefits seem to degrade. Starting salary is substantially lower than industry standards for the region and pay raises are very small or infrequent. Your position may be moved to another group, another company, or another country with minimal notice as there are layoffs every year. General employee moral is low for those who have been with the company more than a few years."
good,"Als je van targets en harde sales houdt, ben je hier op de juiste plek. Echter de druk op sales is in mijn ogen net iets te veel. Verder proberen ze wanneer de tijd rijp is, je te ondersteunen met coaching."
good,"Management is great, although there is little room for advancement. Perfect for a first job to gain experience. Below avg. pay unless you are in Sales or in an Analyst position. Either way, this company is going downhill in the future."
good,Xerox was not very professional work environment. It was very unorganized. The hardest part was dealing with supervisors who weren't as knowledgeable or skilled as the associates
good,A okay place to work management needs a lot of work they are sometimes very unprofessional. The pay is reasonable and the benefits are reasonable as well.
good,"It was OK at best. There were times of confusion and unorganization more often than not. Management was sub-par and didn't implement rules and regulations at the proper times, but only when they were getting frowned upon by he higher ups."
good,the place had a bed bug problem and they refused to tell us about it till i forced a manager too. they never sent out a warning or anything. thats why i left. the place is actually being shut down
good,"They could do better with management talking to the workers.                           "
good,Xerox is and call center with poor management and scheduling  very high turn over of employees.... XEROX WOULD BE A GREAT COMPANY IF MANAGEMENT  WHERE MORE ON HAND AND MORE PROFESSIONAL
good,Not the best job. if you are not a people person then this isn't the  job for you. Customers are very rude on the phone.There is not a lot of advancement within the company.
good,"Great coworkers, I interact  with clients, management and representatives on a daily basis regarding benefits for retirees and survivors. I enjoy coaching and training. I love my coworkers. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping someone achieve their potential."
good,"In Brooklyn I was part of a team orientated diverse company. I traveled by car through all types of weather. "
good,"A place to learn new technologies, work with  people from different countries, the working environment not to bad, good friends"
good,I believe if the company maintain a one on one to help the company be more prosctivited with their employee and get feel back on how to make the company better
good,"Historically respected company leader in printing technology, customer satisfaction and employee support.  Strategic changes in 2017 to focus separately on Technology and Services, splitting the corporation into 2 distinct parts with new management teams."
good,"A typical day at Xerox is being in a large room with cubicles, computers, phones, and headsets. We spend 8-9 hrs/day answering incoming calls from agents that are wanting information about their clients' insurance coverage. Management is good, very attentive, and they take their jobs seriously. The hardest part, or should I say the most stressful part of the job is when calls come in that last 1-2 hours or more. Other than that, it's really not a hard job. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the agents happy by answering any questions or concerns they may have."
good,"The moment that we put on our headset that's the start of everything. we received different types of calls. Most of the time, our callers are irate and mad.  And that's the hardest part of our job. And the most enjoyable is the breaktime, we had a chance to talk to our teammates."
good,"Expect to work and show up. Be prepared for change. Make the best of it. There is a lot of money to be made. You always have an opportunity, they try and work with you to some degree. Schedules change and sups change. From what I hear this is one of the better call centers. If you come from another business sector you might feel like management practices are different.  There's no real change to advance. I was fortunate they took a change with me. I only left then because I left El Paso for Job opportunity."
good,"Each break must be taken at their specified time or you will be out of adherence."
good,"J'ai beaucoup appris mais le manque d'organisation global s'est parfois révélé compliqué à gérer. De plus, certaines personnes sont très désagréables avec les intérimaires."
good,I worked at xerox in a call center type of environment.  the reason i left was because there wasn't a lot of advancement opportunity and the pay wasn't that good.
good,My job is to help clients qualify for government benefits. I have learned customer service skills had hippa training and general information with regard to the benefits. My co workers have the same position I hold. The hardest part of my job is when a client doesn't qualify for benefits but desperately needs them. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a client is able to receive their benefits.
good,"*answering phones"
good,No carrier growth and no salary hike...we dont have enough team members to work..and also if we are doing good work no apperication from upper management
good,"The BPO industry is not an easy job as what others might think about call center industry. It is a hard working environment, although there are perks and fun time to do after working hours, but the measure of excellence of work is definitely they think about."
good,I enjoyed working for this company though did not think that the management was knowledgeable enough on all areas of the position to assist. Better training.
good,I found this company to be a great opportunity for me to grow my skills in many different aspects. Yes there were times were i found myself unhappy and unmotivated but after working through those issues. I found myself better than when i came in.
good,i just started but so far its been fine. i've learned quite a few things since starting. There are plenty of friendly people and a lot more people have made careers of xerox than i would have expected or even they would expect. if you want a career and love customer service xerox is for you.
good,"Management and co-workers was good."
good,Some things that I've learned from xerox is 1. Working around angry costumers and 2. computer skills. My coworkers are very friendly and very easy to get along with. the hardest part working with xerox was that we wasn't given enough resources to answer the costumers questions and concerns.
good,"Overall the business is focused on customer, but execution lets it down. There are numerous opportunities to innovate and improve. However the future is becoming the past and the business model has not changed."
good,"Overtime was obligatory so work/life balance was borderline impossible. Nothing to complain about besides this, the ambient is okay, coworkers are nice, management is okay, hours are incredibly long and tedious but the pay is fine. Nothing amazing, nothing terrible, it just feels like the most normal job in the world. I didn't see many opportunities for advancement during my six months I worked here. The most enjoyable part of the position was that I was allowed to listen to music on my headphones while I processed the data."
good,"•	Invoice and manage 54 regional accounts totaling $21,522,515.00 worth of revenue per month"
good,Xerox has been a place for me to learn and grow. I've met a lot of interesting people and have enjoyed my time here at Xerox.
good,"I've been working at the company from 2011 till 2016.  The upper management at Xerox seems interested in doing their best to sustain the workforce and came out with a Call Center of the Future model which included getting rid of desk phones and replacing them with Avaya software and improving the break room as well as installing large flat screen TV's on the call center floor."
good,The job is only a temporary one and turnover is high.  The job does have benefits as it allows you to gain experience and offers opportunities for development.
good,"Buena empresa para trabajar, falta tener proyectos mas estables  e inversion en el capital humano"
good,I loved my time at Xerox as it was a fun place to be because of the people that I sat next to and that took me under their wing. But my main complaint is with the supervisor who do nothing but sit around watch tv/ sports and when asked to take a call because the Customer Requested to Speak to a Supervisor they make you go back and forth between the Customer and them and get upset if after 3+ attempts at resolving the solution doesn't work and the Customer becomes more irate and Demands a supervisor to be connected.
good,Producive and learning experience. Co-workers are dedicated and hardworder. My typical day at work is picking up mail from mailroom and processing the mail after it is opened. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers
good,"I enjoy working for this company as it has a varied amount of roles / responsibilities on a day to day basis. I deal with customer print requests, I look after the general housekeeping of the floor copiers which ranges from cleaning and making sure they stay functional and to avoid engineer call outs. I also order consumables and paper supplies. I also on an ad hoc basis, cover the company reception dealing with customers on a face to face basis or over the telephone."
good,This got me started in Sales and I enjoyed it.  The biggest was the management at the time was being restructured and lacked commitment and direction.  Product became commodities and direct sales still hung on to old mentality.
good,"A typical day at Xerox as a supervisor I coach and develop agents have daily meeting with management. Our management team is always willing to help and has an open door policy, thanks to our GM I was able to develop from a customer service representative to a supervisor. We have monthly stats we need to meet which is at times stressful but over all its a great place to work."
good,I worked in Tech Support for cel phones. I dreaded getting calls from angry customers. The job doesn't fit me. I thought I was hired to provide technical support but I had to advertise other services and take any other type of calls that I had little training.
good,"It is a job for now, pay is decent, management and mood swings it is ok, schedule is ok but is tiring off every other weekend. every job has its pros and cons"
good,"E-discovery become a part of life. Interaction with law firms, Document review vendor on daily basis is interesting. There are number of things one can learn in e-discovery process."
good,it is been good company but not in terms of job security but you have opportunity to learn a lot  the management is more like a indian style though it is a mnc will go through lot of managerial changes.
good,very fast pace. Great place for employment. Provides adequate training. Supervisors are helpful. However it has a high turnover rate.
good,"Xerox is a great company for getting some professional experience, and the division I worked in was flexible with family life, but those are the only good things I can really say for it.  The pay and benefits are pretty underwhelming and upper management suffers from left hand right hand syndrome.  Every year or two they seem to come in with sweeping changes that conflict with and undermine the goals of previous sweeping changes.  It's like they're throwing things at the wall to see what sticks without giving their efforts time to actually show a real effect.  Unfortunately those sweeping changes often involve layoffs, so you always feel like your head could be on the block at any moment.  "
good,al ser los procesos repetitivos el trabajo se vuelve metódico
good,The co workers are family orient  team players.  The days are steady flow of work.  the working  atmosphere is good .  Learned a great deal from my supervisor  who is vey knowledgeable of the job.
good,"They were very less support from management to implement any requirement to our job "
good,"I was offered an interview and a job through a rep located in Texas. This rep was heavily misinformed and lacked communication with the actual job location and supervisors. The rep told me training would be Mon - Fri 8am - 5pm, so I made arrangements for my 2 children based on that. The rep notified us the day before the first day of training that it would start at 2 pm, but no end time. When I arrived the trainer gave us a schedule completely different than what we were all told by the same rep. They were not flexible, but were apologetic. Attempted to change arrangements for kids based on the given schedule, but I was unable. I ended up removing myself from the payroll."
good,"empresa ótima para trabalhar, mais como a maioria das empresas o salário é baixo e poucas promoções."
good,"not fun"
good,"I enjoyed being a Customer Service Rep, being able to socialize with individuals and educate them on Roadside assistance as well as helping them in tough situations. The people I worked with everyday also made the job more enjoyable. Their are some very supportive individuals that work at Xerox solutions as well as development and advancement in which I totally took advantage of. Some of the hardest things I've faced at Xerox is all the different personalities and situations you have to deal with everyday. The calls you have to handle are typically high stress situations you cannot take everything personal, always listen to the customer, and have empathy and assurance. Its always good to respond versus react with a good attitude and a helping had. I gained a lot of knowledge working at Xerox it was my first call center job and where I learned the most experience working so far in my life Xerox/leadership. I acquired the tools to succeed there, too always strive for success with a good attitude."
good,Not very fun and management is very unprofessional. Management is very rude and disrespectful. I would not like to work for Xerox if that management continues.
good,Xerox is a great company to work for they handle their employees with respect. The hardest part of the job was drive to the job in inclement weather.
good,"One of the only good thing about the place is the pay. The work is long and ultra repetitive. management is fine but not equal, some are good and some are not so much, really the luck of your draw."
good,It is easy to achieve and advance. It is an ok environment. I don't have anything else to say about this company. I would recommend this company.
good,"The main part I spent at Xerox was as Escalated Software Support Agent supporting mainly corporate customers and field engineers. It was a very small and specialized team and I enjoyed the technical aspect of the job the most. I learned a lot about Active Directory, LDAP, Scan to FTP amongst other things. Naturally people around me were enjoying the technical aspect too and quite often colleagues would have 4-6 PC at home to hone their Exchange and Active Directory skills at home. Many of my former colleagues went on to more technical jobs in Enterprise Support or IT in general, but a few are still working in the same team."
good,"Hello, "
good,"a typical day would be answering phones, answering benefit questions, changing or updating current benefits and enrolling participants in benefits during open enrollment period. I learned a new skill and I have a better understanding of the open enrollment process. Its something I have never done before. My manager was very knowledgeable and professional. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was the inability to help participants once open enrollment ended. Most enjoyable was working with my team and learning something new."
good,"While the work/life balance and salary was good, the management was not very hands on and the training was non-existent.  Had there been more training and opportunity I may have continued on in the company."
good,"This is a decently steady job, however there is really no opportunity for growth in this company,and for that reason the turn over rate is high."
good,"I would recommend xerox to anyone looking to get started in technical support. There's a great team atmosphere and tons of resources to find answers to complex customer situations."
good,"Typically, we get our work load, then we get down to work. The environment allows for interaction with other designers where opinions can be shared. Co-workers have always been decent for the most part, its a very professional environment but there is fun to be had. No room for advancement, poor pay grade for expectations and no benefits. Constant open discussions about cut backs which gives a sense of insecurity. The hardest part is the constant turn over and getting used to new management, the most enjoyable part would certainly be the interesting projects and the co-workers."
good,"Typical day at work, sitting in my cubical, talking to members about their insurance policies, giving information concerning their policies, taking care and/ or giving information regarding their monthly billing."
good,"I waited several months to receive my Clearance but i never did. Then my contract ended without notice or reason."
good,"Contract is up and will be done May 6, 2016. "
good,Very busy from September to January. A typical day consist of long sitting on the phone talking to customers (which can be a pain or joyous) and eavesdropping (which gets annoying).
good,ive been with this company for a few years and so much has changed. The one good thing about the job is a set schedule. The people here as far as management are really nice but the customers that call in are always angry and we deal with that on a daily
good,I love working here because it provides me with hours to make the funds able to provide for my family. I would like it to be closer to home especially since I am attending school and would like to finish school to gain my degree in Social Work.
good,The pay is good and you can get 40 hours per week. Project based and you won't know if you will be hired for permanent employment. Some managers are helpful and some not so much.
good,"low compensation"
good,"My boss made sure I learned something new each day, he also made sure we had some fun at work while making sure we all made our deadlines, things changed on a daily basis and was sometimes hard to keep up with but my team and my boss made it all seem simple when in actuality it really wasn't.  I would have loved to have stayed there and worked with them, but it was a contract  position and my contract was up."
good,"Overall bothered by the lack of consistency among supervisors, and the constant micromanagement of the Ops Team.   Co-workers were always great, they will be sorely missed."
good,Fast paced environment on a daily basis. Performs clerical / data entry / and customer service to major clients. Uses the skills of multi-tasking and navigating through more than one screen at a time while communicating with customers.
good,"Elke dag is anders op werk wat het juist leuk maakt."
good,"Company offers a flexible work environment, however difficult to maintain a work/life balance due to long work hours. Co-workers are dedicated and team players."
good,"Great company for advancement. Xerox have several locations not only in the USA but in other countries. The location I worked at was a large call center, so you were treated more like a number rather then a person, esp. with the high turnover rate. But if you can stick it out, you'll be sure to move up or place for another position in no time."
good,"Great place to work. Management could work a little better together but other than that, it's a great place to be at. You can easily move up to a higher position if you pay attention and apply yourself."
good,The employment was temporary. Nothing really to rave about.  If i was able to not have to leave this review I wouldn't. I really don't have anything to say about it.
good,Houston management is good but overall management not so good. Too longer a wait to be eligible for any benefit. Co-workers are nice though.
good,There is no clear path to advancement as several leaders on our project are hand-picked without a formal competitive posting process.  Basically if one of the project leaders likes you then you can get a raise and a promotion. I have witnessed varying degrees of disparate treatment of employees.  It is easy to tell who the “cool kids” are on this project.  The project leaders only speak to the managers they favor.
good,"I wasn't there very long, went though the training finished only to be told they where closing in two months. I don't even know why they where hiring people like they where and training. they had 6 other training classes including mine from when I started to when they closed. "
good,It's good company. I was working for US Healthcare BPO sector. And I enjoyed during my stay at this company and learnt alot about the process.
good,Your typical call center I'd assume. only allotted a total of two 10 minute breaks and one 30minute lunch for a 8.5 hour work day. You must remain at your cubicle taking calls for the entire course of your day.
good,Stressful environment because of unsupported management.  Not a fun place to work.  The most enjoyable part is taking care of the members concerns and speaking to them on a daily basis.
good,I learned that you have to be patience with older people when they call in about their medication. You have over 8000 documents to assess for whatever a caller wants to know; from medication to changing address.
good,"Productive, heavy volume, very detail transaction processing. Co-workers are very friendly and helpful."
good,The job was good except that Union employees have not gotten any raises for the past several years and with Union due increases and medical insurance increases I am currently making less money in each check then I was each and every of the previous years I've worked here.
good,"Receiving customer service calls for Verizon Wireless. Logging notes, resolving concerns, thinking outside the box, operating cisco phone system, de-escalating calls, training my team, listening to calls, taking escalated calls, using word/excel/outlook. "
good,Productive work place management is a decent crowd to work with. All about numbers no room to personally grow or develop unless you know somebody.
good,I enjoyed working at Xerox. The training opportunities I received when I was asked (I accepted) to go to Maryland to assist in training a new group of reps was rewarding and valuable. You can advance here if you desire to do so.
good,"Xerox India was a good place to work, but the salary benefit and productivity is really worst. The only reason why people are continuing in this organization is stress free work environment. The very bad thing which I have observed is the chances of enhancing the skill set is really less. Xerox India Cochin division is a better place of work for house wife's."
good,This is the best place to be Monday to Friday 9:00 - 5:00. co-workers are good team players and we achieve the goal together
good,"I had been with my company for over twenty years when in 2010, we were purchased by Xerox.  Over the next four years, Xerox did not  play a vital role in our everyday existing operations. My overall time there was pleasant and colleagues became good friends."
good,"If you are looking for a job in high tech you maybe find a good place there. Laser cutting, CAD with AutoCAD inventor, Microscope measurement, air-conditioned workplace, clean and a good work atmosphere. "
good,"Zeer gezellige werkomgeving, maar onderbetaald. Variabel werkelke dag anders, erg leuke collega's."
good,"Xerox will not keep the hard working people.  If you are late, call in a lot, or slack on performance you will be guaranteed job security.  If you arrive on time, work hard, and show up every day, you are not secure in your position.  You can be let go at any time."
good,"A typical day of work is answering phones constantly. You must write inquiries for each call even if the person calls and hangs up. The environment is very drama-filled. If you keep to yourself and prepare to get screamed at by customers the job isn't that bad. I dislike the fact that the customer's questions are not easily answerable so you have to keep them waiting a LOT. Also, it makes me feel badly that the supervisors don't stay off of their cell phones because they could be stealing the customer's information. When I was working there, there were two security breaches within the same month and for anyone who's family has Humana it makes you feel bad."
good,"It's sort of like a piece of cake! Everyday you talk to someone different, whether nice or mean they make the day go by fast. The atmosphere is different, you have co-workers willing to help you and people that are just as helpful as you are in the work environment."
good,"I've spent many years, 17 to be exact, with Xerox. I enjoyed my work even though at times, there were challenges at many levels..most beyond my control. Very talented peers I've had the pleasure to work with and call family"
good,"Expanding in marketplace, leaders in industry, flexible, international, promote from within, eight thirty to five, monday thru friday"
good,"Innovative, results-oriented in various industries and office settings. Detail-oriented and goal-focused business professionals that can successfully deliver exceptional customer to all clients. Demonstrates ability to achieve targeted goals, meet budgets, and excel in challenging situations. Capable of creative problem solving, utilization of critical thinking skills, and effective communication expertise. Successfully answer all internal and external inquiries while consistently focusing on strategic goals of organization. Capable of leading, developing, and successfully implementing administrative processes to further business goals."
good,Xerox is a big company without many career development opportunities. There seems disconnection between leaders on how they think the company is doing.
good,In my salary position I was overworked for the salary provided but enjoyed the people that I worked with. Management however had little knowledge regarding call center management or were more interested in their own personal advancement then the success of the call center.
good,"Didn't really feel important there. Customers were constantly angry, management was subpar. Sometimes during the busiest hours and days there would only be one supervisor available. New employees got paid more than ones working there before hand"
good,"Dias de provas, loja cheia, povo agitado, lucro constante."
good,"It's just me personally but I don't like the call center environment. It was my very first call center and to be fair it was just starting up when I joined. But it can be quite the chaotic mess, suddenly things are made mandatory such as overtime and training. When you do take training you are rushed through it and made to sign a sheet and they don't allow you time to read through anything so if you should make a mistake that you so-called were ""trained on"" they'll bring it back up in your face. Times are stiff and timed to the tee and you get docked for literally everything you do from staying on break over a minute to leaving the member on hold for a second more than 2 minutes."
good,Overall it was a great learnig experience. Company has grown since I first started. I'm expecting for Xerox to be around for many years to come.
good,"Xerox is filled with learning new things daily such as exploring new researches and navigating through several systems, the management is ok and the co-workers can tend to give you a laugh or two to make the day go by swiftly, Hardest part of the job is dealing with the point system but your day consist of what you make out of it."
good,"Our work started in receiving calls from doctors, nurses and secretaries.  We educate them the health insurance benefit of a certain member and explain them how a particular claim was processed.  I have learned how to communicate with different personalities in every call I handle in which the management always see to it that each costumer care representative is knowledgeable in the account that was assigned to us.  My colleagues were also friendly and willing to share the ideas and knowledge to the newbies.  I believe that there is no part in this job that I found hard to perform however the most enjoyable part in this job is getting to know different people I meet everyday."
good,i believe Xerox would be a better company of management wasnt so unorganized. Things are not done correctly from the root and the problem then comes about when it gets out to the agents. Management should be more friendly and should be able to make eye contact with you when speaking. I feels as if everything has to be communicated properly and situations should be handled professionally to make your employees want to be at work and work to their full potiental.
good,"web tools for training are good. Flexible schedule. minimum management."
good,"overall pretty good job the most enjoyable part were the Co-workers, it just wasn't enough pay for the commute.a typical day would be very busy."
good,"answering inbound questions about the medicines that the various pharmaceutical companies produce. Sending out literature about medicines, patient assistance programs and other services that the pharmaceutical companies provide."
good,"it was a very good place to work at, but i thought i deserved something better due to my qualifications and knowledge."
good,"call center workplace, inbound and out bound calls, troubleshooting Android products, Data entry. Management was hit or miss, good place to work if they could get organized."
good,"If your work life consists of call center jobs, Xerox is one of the best to work for. However, the pay sucks at 9.50/hour, promotions are an additional 15 cents, and the calls coming in are for roadside services of Allstate. The calls can be hard to deal with as people can be stupid and don't want to follow directions or listen to what you say. in order to get a good bonus at the end of the month, which can be up to 200 dollars extra, you need to have a better than average handle time, a good quality assurance score, don't call out sick, don't be late from lunch or breaks, and try to have people be towed to authorized repair facilities. The people who work with you are awesome, the supervisors are very helpful, and you can get promoted quickly if you desire to."
good,"On a typical day I would take up to 100 phone calls a day."
good,Call center dealing with mail order prescriptions and insurance. I learned a bit about insurance. Management was not the best they didn't have enough knowledge about some of the process. My co-workers were okay but Xerox will literally hire anybody so...you understand what I'm saying. The best part of the job is paid holidays and the coffee machine in the break room.
good,Large enterprise environment from which you can learn a lot from. You must be able to resolve sev 1 tickets as fast as you can.
good,since ACS was acquired by Xerox the already impressive client list has been boosted even more. But the compensation and package remain well below market standards
good,"Werkzaamheden: Binnen Xerox als klantenservice medewerker voor project Bol.com. Helpen van klachten van de klanten, andere agents helpen met vragen, agents voorzien van feedback, senior agent binnen project bol.com."
good,I was an excellent employee here. I am still eligible to return to this employer. I was not happy with training of employees and the managerment of the employer. The equipment was outdated and the space was I was provided was very brutal.They changed rules and management ever month. No one was ever on the same page. We were without  a account manager an supervisor for 6 months and to this day no account manager. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
good,"A day at work consist of physical, clerical, and administrative duties. I've learned that there will always be challenges and obstacles in every job. What matters is how you respond to the challenges. Coworkers are hard workers with plenty of skill sets. Hardest part of the job is dealing with process changes. The most enjoyable part is leaving after a hard days work and knowing a job well done has been performed."
good,"Tipica giornata di lavoro:"
good,I enjoy the work I do with this company or another company This job I am on I do my thing and I do it very well. It's a god company to work for if you have been their for a while.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting the callers with their issues. My co-workers, worked together to help each other as a team to ensure productivity."
good,I didn't mind working for Xerox at all. I enjoyed my job. I just wish there would have been part-time hours available. That way I could have gone to school and worked.
good,"I learned a lot in this job, mainly regarding giving constructive feedback and how to handle resistance in conversations.  It was great to know we were helping people to find a suitable job, in times with high unemployment."
good,"I learned a lot there."
good,Management - the numbers are all that matters these days even if they are the by product of puffery (an old legal term). Outlooks are frequently missed because they are generated in phony forecasting tools that once were valid but now are a hoax. Add in the fact that former Executive slugs proliferate the Business Development team and voila! you have a downturn in new business which was completely foreseeable and preventable.
good,"working for xerox its great just that in PR management needs to be educated, other than that excellent place to work. salary that good hours worked, well i used to  work almost 70 hours a week but hey ho complains about it ."
good,"Bij Xerox werken betekent, hard werken met een collegiale gemoedelijke sfeer."
good,"They will hire and train just about anyone. The turn-over hate is high not only with the employees but also with the management staff. Very little job security, about every year they clean house for no reason. little to no organization."
good,"Good work environment"
good,"Era bem agradável de trabalhar nessa empresa, a loja é bem cuidada, bem organizada.."
good,Xerox is a call center environment that gave me the opportunity to advance from a Customer Care Representative into the Training environment as well as a management position with Supervising. The  best thing about the job was being able to learn from co workers.
good,Great place to start out if you are fresh out of college.  Management watches tightly over your every move.  Great experience to be gained.  Compensation can be good.
good,"I am currently working virtual in an office environment. Managing client monthly reporting submission, and billing. Assisting our customers and billing team with concerns or questions regarding their invoice."
good,managers there basically don't care about anything. Only that they want us to finish the calls in their requirements
good,"Empresa com ambiente de trabalho satisfatório, gerência excelente"
good,"O dia de trabalho tranquilo "
good,Overall I like the job just wish there was more room for growth. The hours are good just keep to yourself and do not get wrapped up in work drama among co-workers.
good,"A typical day at the job is coming to work to service the customers."
good,"My workdays varied from location to location.  Much of what they did was contracted facilities management, each location being very different, yet providing many of the same type of print services.  Since they were a new, growing business, many of the supervisors had very little training or ability to lead people and motivate employees.  The most difficult part of the job was when going from one location to a new location, there were different requirements and expectations.  I did learn much about the business and also interaction with many different types of people and workplaces, ranging from technology to legal to corporate.  I also worked at the main reproduction center, which operated as a small print shop which was a support facility as well as a production facility for jobs brought in to us from various sales people with many types for clients."
good,Buen equipo de trabajo.Prestos a colaborar con el objetivo de la empresa en general.
good,Come in and try and find a computer that actually works. Then find a chair thats not broke. If you can manage that then find a headset that works.
good,"I learned alot about customer service at xerox, they taught me the importance of how to treat a customer, and that the customers issues are never personal."
good,"I enjoy the work I do.  A typical day at work, I approved a few needy families for health insurance which feels great, I also have to deny some people which doesn't feel so great. I have learned that when dealing with healthcare laws there are so many aspects that always have to be considered and the laws and requirements are ever changing which challenges be to stay sharp and up date with new information. My co-workers are great, we sit in a cubicle environment and we all get along for the most part, I would consider my co-workers the highlight of my day. The hardest part of my job are recent pay cuts due to the health care reform act and our pay being restructured based on the difference in the work flow."
good,"Everyone's experience with a company differs. I will not bad mouth a company that has given me the knowledge of Health and Welfare, Pension and Investment plan benefits."
good,"Steady productive workplace, learned a lot of things about the product that the company was dealing with."
good,"on the phone and computer all day"
good,"trabalho maneiro, aprendi como lidar com clientes, mexer no caixa e outras atribuições da Xerox. a direção era muito boa e justa no ambiente era só eu que cuidava do estabelecimento as vezes os filhos do gerente. a parte difícil era quando acabava material e eu tinha que fechar a loja pra comprar, pois la os materiais era contado, efetiva nova compra só quando tivesse acabando, o bom que tive muita influencia com os funcionários do fórum e quando era elogiado pelos magistrados pela agilidade de comandar 3 maquinas fotocopiadora sozinho ."
good,As i was working at Xerox my fellow employees and i knew that we were all expendable.
good,My typical day would consist of helping providers do travel authorizations for patients to seek medical advice.
good,Learned a lot about the Human Resource Benefits business and worked with a lot of very talented people.
good,"1.	Provide L1/L2/L3 support for IPT solutions to Allergan Inc. as part of Telecom team. Products Supported:"
good,This job is not bad if you need work. Overall pretty average work environment. All I can really say is there are people who can work in call centers and those who can't.
good,This was a typical call center type of environment. The typical day was taking calls from cell phone customers. Supervisors/management could have been a bit more supportive.
good,"Lead efforts to deliver enterprise applications and solutions, incluging client image, network (AD) deployment, and print management solutions"
good,"I learned a lot working with Xerox, but I just don't like the fact that you can't get any assistance from Managers."
good,"Xerox is good for a call center job, the down side is over hiring causing extremely slow conditions during certain parts of the month and causing pay and hours to drop. The ABC pay is a terrible idea."
good,Not much to say read the things that I wrote. They are making me use more characters so I am writing nonsense just to get past this.
good,"Working in a gradually dying industry, but in the only viable part of the campus. A new 30million$ addition adds maybe 5-7 years max. No upward movement in company, no opportunities. 4x7 shift work, day night rotating makes life outside of work difficult. Working the chemical process is interesting, but not worth staying for as a career."
good,"Acting a customer care representative, the job itself was at times difficult, dealing with serious problems that impacts peoples livelihood with medical, dental, and vision insurance. But on the whole was generally easy enough if you had a grasp of what you were talking about. These positions have you employed up to 6 months if you are lucky enough to be made permanent afterwards, this was difficult for the first group of employees to understand. Overall, it is a decent job to hold you over while looking for another or if you are satisfied making $15 an hour while almost never making a raise and having a lottery chance of advancing, then this may suit you well.."
good,"Busy environment, mostly friendly staff, small team, learning part of the job takes time but once learnt, you are an equal member of team, you work two shifts, morning 7am - 3.30pm and mids 8.30 - 5pm, team decides quota. Overtime is rare and usually leave on time. We work mostly in isolation on this site, information on further training or advancement is virtually non-existent."
good,"We never know what would happen from one moment to the next."
good,"performance requirements were demanding, but site management provided better training and support than previous call centers I worked in"
good,"The best part of my position is walking into a new situation on a daily basis.  I have found that no two network environments are the same which provides me with a different challenge daily.  My peers are fun, reliable and helpful.  I enjoy working with them at all times.  Another great benefit of my position is the ability to work remotely and schedule my appointments accordingly.  "
good,Good employees and a hardworking environment.  Opportunities for relocation.
good,"everyday starts with checking emails for costumer job tickets."
good,"Monday through Friday, from 8:30 to 5:00, I would be in my office across the hall from my manager and write procedures based on interviews with our client. We had a daily meeting before noon where all procedural writers were expected to give updates on their procedures and estimate an ETA. On interview days, we recorded the instructions our clients gave us and either called or emailed (per the client's preference) if we had any questions."
good,"- Reasonable hours"
good,I had a scheduled run that I did from building to building and if time pending any other little deliveries I could squeeze in. I learned no matter how hard you work and how happy you made the clientele  your job is not safe. Management thought of them selves and not of the workers unfortunately. There  was no hard part of my job I always enjoyed what I was doing everyday. Being able see that the clients had smiles on there faces at the end of the day.
good,"A typical day at work always starts out busy. As far as training, there were many questions that we had once we hit 'production' that were trained in the class. Once you are done with the 8 weeks of training its pretty much sink or swim. The overall environment daily was pretty great though, I loved all my coworkers. The management had a balance of not so good and very good managers. Under my supervisor, our team was pretty motivated nonetheless so we managed to come out on top a few times."
good,"Although I enjoyed working at this company, job security is lacking due to reduction in force which, typically, occurs quarterly.  Also, this is an outsourcing firm, meaning the company develops a service onshore, maintains it for a bit and then slowly offshores it to places such as Mexico, Jamaica, India, etc. which results in the reduction of employment opportunities onshore.  Lastly, there are no ""incentives"", they do not warrant raises based on performance and, rarely, overtime is offered, thus making it difficult to enhance your income."
good,"Multiple deadlines and goals are set for department to meet with minimum resources available to complete tasks.  Great team to work with.  Immediate management works hard to supply tools needed to get jobs completed, but higher management denies department with the advancement of training/equipment to complete the work in a more efficient way.  I have learned how to interact on a daily basis directly with corporate clients and how to build trust and understanding."
good,"I think the company should just have uniforms for all call centers.  The location I worked at was very unprofessional.  I mean ladies doing sew ins while working, coming to work in house slippers and do rags on.  As far as schedule, it was great.  You know what time you're getting off and what two days you have off."
good,"~The most enjoyable parts of my job are the employees I work with daily, assisting the employee population directly and the opportunities to learn from the Legal Department regarding the more challenging cases we face each day. "
good,"Team Playing"
good,"Dan facilidades para poder trabajar remotamente. Buen ambiente de trabajo en general. Sin embargo, no hay crecimiento profesional ni entrenamiento. No es una buena opción para gente con deseos de superación,  sino como experiencia solamente por unos dos a tres años."
good,"Hours were crazy, sometimes 10 or 12 hours per day, sometimes 11 or 12 days in a row."
good,I enjoy helping the public at large with issues revolving around healthcare benefits. Its a high volume call center with a changing work schedule from week to week. Even as Full Time employees you dont know what your schedule may look like for the next week making it difficult to plan a life accordingly.  I dont like the ABC pay scale especially when your not provided with all the necessary tools to be successful with that type of pay scale.
good,It is a fast paced environment. Work load--very busy. Little room for mistakes and for advancement. No raises or bonuses. Benefits are ok but could be better.
good,"It was a performance pay based system and while I understand that it was solely on how well I did as a customer service representative, I was not in agreement with the practice of my performance and pay being affected by the customers that I was speaking with. For example, a failed survey for whatever reason would result in loss of wages and this was daily and could also result in termination. I do agree with performance evaluations but to allow the customer's judgement of my job, their day and what I can/cannot do for them that day to determine how much I make was ludicrous."
good,assisting customer with inquiries about bank account and maintance
good,It was a job.  Once I understood Xerox only cared what I could do for them I didn't have any problems with unrealistic expectations.
good,"Take customer calls dealing with healthcare issues and insurance. Learned about insurance claims and issues, how to take customer calls and direct calls to the proper area. Management was great. The co-workers were great as well. Hardest part of the job was to learn all the different codes and the forms on each healthcare issue but I learned quickly and actually got promoted. The most enjoyable part of the job was to give great customer service and get rewarded for positive customer feedback."
good,Ok place to work at. Job security is not that great. Management really doesn't care about their employees.
good,"I was good at what I did, so I did not have many problems. I saw terrible turnover and bad attitudes throughout. Employees hated the ABC Pay Structure. Also that customers can dictate your paycheck. You can work hard and make money. Promotions are steady. It is a madhouse sometimes. But if you are not working..."
good,"Constant phone contact with customers.  After training, very little interaction with co-workers.  Enjoyed helping customers maintain and understand their accounts."
good,wish they had perm positions... its always hard and nerveracking  if u will still have a job after finishing a project
good,Way too many systems or web pages to remember which one you use to find the various information that you provide to the customers. Stressful
good,Day to day operations were pretty good as long as there a good server signal that we could do the daily assigned jobs. I learned a lot about customer service and the handling of disgruntled and satisfy customers.Management was decent in the day to day basis of informing the reps about new changes within the company and systems updates.The classroom training and training on the call center floor was also a plus and regularly consistent. The hardest part of my job was during the chat part of my job. My job tittle was phone/chat and email rep.The most enjoyable part of my job was coming to work with a group of co-workers who I like working with and a couple of supervisors / managers who would compliment and praise the reps for a great job well done on a daily basis.
good,"Solving customer’s technical and security issues and associated concerns proactively regarding their Apple Mobile Devices. (iPhones, iPads, and iPods – iTunes Store, App Store, etc)  Emphasis more on helping the customers than fixing technical problems."
good,great place to work as a Pharmacist! office environment; mostly Monday  thru Friday work schedule; paid major holidays; vacation and sick time
good,"Co-workers were great to work with, management was difficult. Employee's were friendly and most are professional."
good,A typical day would be answering phones and helping out customers. I learned a lot of new techniques for working with the customer and management could have been better. There was such a high turnover rate that people were promoted without second thought. It was a very unprofessional place to work that seemed to have hired a lot of young minded people. The hardest part of the job is worrying that you were on the phone to long or did too many transfers. Things like this determine your pay and that’s very stressful.
good,"Management was very supportive, however there are not very many ways you can advance here.  It's either a supervisor of a small call-center team or other jobs which pay the same amount as an entry level employee.  The pay for supervisors is not much higher than for entry level employees, either.  Also, the site has been on a pay freeze since inception."
good,Customer service position in which data was also imputed to calculate income driven repayment plans.
good,"It's a typical 9-5, flexible work hours.  They cater to working parents.  For the most part, the co-workers are friendly.  Everyone has at least a 5 year tenure.  Management is standard.  It's based on your attitude and your manager's.  The work is fast-paced.  You deal with internal clients (sales reps, controllers, field reps, etc) and not so much with external customers.  Xerox is a very customer focused company.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the economical struggles.  They've been on a hiring freeze for over 5 years, which means very few raises.  The location is very nice.  There are lots of outside vendors and places to escape from work."
good,"Xerox is a call center which delivers customer service for Verizon Wireless customers.  Our representatives give customer service on continuous inbound calls.  They get paid based on how long they are on the inbound call and surveys from customer on their quality and how they resolved the customers issues.  Each day their pay can be different.  "
good,"Xerox is a organization that handles the HR support for different brands and organization. I specialized in Pension services. A typical day was taking calls from retirees and potential Retires that wanted learn more or start there pension retirement. Through working in this field I have learned a lot about health and insurance and Pension plans and furthered my knowledge in medical field of Retirement. The management was good when I first started with the company, then the company went through a management shift and the change was not for the betterment of the company. The surrounding co-workers I worked with was awesome, they were very friendly, honest and hardworking Representatives. The job was not hard to maintain, the best part that I enjoyed is working with my co-workers and with the retirees helping them to to take a very important step in there lives"
good,"Advanced Computer Skills Required, Able to use mp3 players to listen to music or audio books while working, Sometimes there is drama in the workplace from coworkers, but you have to learn to ignore them. Pay is good for the type of job. Hard to sit in chairs for 8 hours at a time."
good,"Wonderful, caring & attentive supervisors and co-workers. Upper management is very slow to accommodate important requests no matter what that request may be. Compensation is reasonable for representatives but does not seem fair for supervisors (the glue to the company)."
good,"A normal day a work it's get there on time, and answer call through the day, and assist customers with different issues "
good,This company paid via activity based compensation. I worked 8-5 mon-fri. 
good,Spoke to employee's about their benefits. Meet some really nice people during my employment.
good,Working at Xerox was a great opportunity for me to meet new people and to explore a new work environment. I had the advantage to experience working on the phones I learned a little bit of everything regarding the phones the service the company had. Xerox did lack with professionalism. The company did not enforce dress code and punctuality etc.
good,A usual day in the work place is a hostile enviroment with other associates who all feel like they are not valued for all there hard work put in.
good,"buen ambiente laboral,no contabamos con tiempo mas que para atender llamadas por lo que no fue mucho el tiempo que compartia con mis compañeros.aprendi a ser tolerante y paciente y a estar al servicio del cliente ya que esta era mi responsabilidad."
good,"We would travel the region and repair color copiers, and color production copiers.  We would work on computer front ends to professional presses.  Sent replenishment requests.  Normal field service."
good, 
good,"Customer services including, technical support, billing, plan change, networking, account adjusting, troubleshooting, etc. all for Sprint PCS. "
good,Job was easy to catch on too but it hard to grow in the company. Its only a handful of people so overtime is mandatory most of the time
good,"B2B Relationship building executive. Working with client executive teams made up of CEO, CFO, COO, CIO, etc to review financial metrics and efficiencies relating to their technology infrastructure."
good,"Very nice plays to start up career and learning. But the growth is very slow and very less in monetary wise, benefits and career growth"
good,"I received a promotion, giving me more responsibilities, what i didn't know when accepting the promotion is that it would come with a 35% reduction in wages."
good,Empresa com ótima relação interpessoal e trabalho em equipe.
good,"xerox is a good starting point in a career, the pay is ok, but you can move up in the company fast, there are communication errors with management and the reps, lots of conflicting rules and ways."
good,Uma empresa legal de se trabalhar mais com um salario muito baixo que exige muito de seus funcionários.
good,A limiting environment that doesn't allow for advancement without some real assertion and linking up with the right hiring manager that will fight for you. What kept me going into work every day was the great team that I worked with. I found great satisfication in being able to work with my internal team to develop solutions and be able to deliver to my internal customers and meet expectations and almost always exceed them. The hardest part of the job was the politics. The most enjoyable was working with the internal customers I had cultivated over the years.
good,"Typically employees of Xerox Services are assigned to long-term roles on a major project in one of its many line of business pipelines. This typically involves work that engages the client directly, in addition to working with other partners in the industry. The salary is fair, and the work is challenging. If you are inclined for cross-training opportunities and learning new skills, these are available as well."
good,This company will make you do a lot for the amount of money you earn. You will learn a lot while your employed but who knows how long that may be.
good,A sub division of Xerox. Since this program was recently acquired by ACS. Many of the benefits and compensation has not yet been merged. Raises are non-exstistent.
good,Accounts department work Iam looking at trichy itself
good,The business culture is very laid back but the some of the leadership lack promoting skilled employees into key areas.
good,"Job was ok but not exciting, not good for people who prefer to interact with others"
good,Late morning to early evening and all day Saturday schedule makes it tough. No growth potential seen and pay level quoted by recruiters is not correct. Turnover is medium to moderate.
good,"Xerox is a good place to work, with great people. The hard part, if you want to call it that, is that every month it gets very busy, which allows for alot of overtime,(up to 7 days a week)."
good,Good work life balance but low pay for successful sales reps and have lost career advancement planning along the way. They have been undergoing a large transformation from a technology to a services company and have lost focus on the employee.
good,"Now with GPS systems company always can monitor an employees movements. There was a time when trust was the key word within the company, which spurred innovation and we were evaluated by actual results in the field, and by customer results and customer input. This resulted in the freedom to do the job and innovate better ideas to accomplish our goals of customer satisfaction faster and more cost effective by the people in the field doing the job. Now it is about bureaucracy and in the attempt to falsely cut cost with technology watching every move strangling invention. If technology was to hold down costs of doing business and make doing business more profitable, why have austerity cut backs still not made the company profitable, and increased customer base."
good,The hardest part of this job was maintaning a good attitude with all the negative people around you. The workplace was very unprofessional and not career like.
good,"Its simple, Xerox becomes your life. Xerox first and family second."
good,"Good people at this job site, unfortunatley I was a temp and they were not willing to let me advance nor did they want anybody too, Xerox that is, too bad as many customer were very happy with my work!"
good,Being acquired by Xerox did not impact my day to day function. The culture remained the same in my division. My job was performed with the same ease as before.
good,"Peers are great, project work is challenging.  New management team in place and taking Xerox into different direction that is not favorable for remote and older work force"
good,"Used to be a great place to work but with all the changes and the HCL contracting all jobs are on the chopping block."
good,"They were a good company to work for.  They were friendly, helpful and also did alot of great training.  Supervisor on our team was great.  They were flexible."
good,"dealing with the rude customers is actually the hardest part about working for ANY call center. The rest is just showing up to do your job, very easy."
good,Company is no loner in operation.  When it was there was a stark disconnect between ownership and management as well as between management and its employees.
good,Just depends on what your looking for in a job. It’s a fine place to work. Office environment is just okay though. Just keep you head low and do your work. Don’t get into the office gossip
good,Overall I felt fulfilled with my employment at Xerox. I contributed to the daily sales activities.  It wasn’t until my job was off shored things became difficult.
good,"Working on printers is fun and interesting if you are a logical thinker with mechanical aptitude."
good,"Xerox was a wonderful place to work for many years. However, the company has been struggling for the last few years resulting in stalled salaries, vacant positions not backfilled, no advancement opportunities, massive lay offs and little investment in fixing or improving internal technology - all leading to increased burden on remaining employees and constant worry about job security. The last year or so under John Visentin has shaken things up and caused more uncertainty. There are some really good, passionate, customer-focused people working there (including management) though."
good,I was laid off and people with less ability and qualifications were kept due to their race and gender. Reverse discrimination was in practice.  Sad situation with corruption at high levels back east and several executives pleaded no contest and Xerox paid fines to SEC.
good,"Nothing bad to say about it other than that our contract got pulled by Google, and that our management were a little childish at times.  But they were all college kids for the most part, so whatever"
good,"Xerox helps develop your work ethic. Definitely a place to grow, but, not a forever home. It was a stop to my career goals. I recommend for graduated seniors out of high school."
good,"If you are looking for a sales roles, as role as a service tech, or a human resource professional there are still roles in Xerox for you.  All other aspects of the company have been outsourced to India"
good,"A typical day at work would be taking upward of 30 phone calls per day. "
good,"Xerox was alright, not really something I wanted to do, but I had graduated from college and found myself without work for about 10 months.  It did allow me to stay on top of my computer skills, communication, team work, and metrics."
good,This company is a great company to work for. . Just gotta work with employees when they are asking for something’s. Incentives are great for employees
good,This company is fine. It all just depends on what you’re looking for in a job. Not a terrible place to work though. Always ask what the job offers and what you’re looking for.
good,I provided support to Apple customers. The company is no longer in Bolingbrook but was not a bad company to work for. They did have multiple accounts they worked with.
good,"Good place to work but changing industry landscape is adversely affecting the company. Company has struggled to adapt, and this is affecting work morale."
good,"I used to work with electronics, we were based in printers. I used to deliver printers to every kind of work place. The hardest part is that we used to work under time schedule, had limited time"
good,"This would be the last job I would recommend. It's one of the ghetto call centers, but if someone just REALLY needed a job, then I would probably recommend they go there"
good,It’s been so long but that I can recall changes were made a lot and mandatory OT each month. Didn’t like the fact of first come first serve on the seating. Dust
good,"Non c'era molto da imparare, il lavoro era monotono e poco dinamico."
good,"Working at Xerox was a challenging task ! The Job environment is very eye opening and different.  I learned a lot at the company , customer service skills & more.  I enjoyed the work experience."
good,"The people I work with are absolutely fantastic. In the US office, there is a close knit environment that kindles professional friendships and team work is good"
good,"Opportunité de développement en interne"
good,Xerox getting out of the healthcare business solutions market was a disaster. The company is not handling the transition well.  Many people have already left.
good,I learned and achieved a lot while employed there. Tuition reimbursement was a plus and great culture back in the early 2000s. Things are constantly changing and nothing is stable within the company today but I'm grateful for the opportunity they provided me.
good,"Xerox is a good brand to have on your resume and helps open your gates to the fortune companies. "
good,This was a very face paced job. Calls were back to back for most of your shift. Everyday was a learning day. Change occurred an a daily basis which could be good
good,Not a bad place to work although there is an element of gossip in the work place that's annoying . Lots of favoritism and priority given to some for raises and promotions.
good,"Empresa con procesos establecidos enfocados a los clientes, accionistas y empleados."
good,"I was hired by a contractor to work for Xerox as a DocuCare Analyst. It was rewarding work, but in a corporate environment where minding ones P's and Q's was essential to survival. You had to know who to kiss up to in order to remain employed there. I was let go after being given a task with a deadline nobody could have met, then that was used as justification to terminate my contract. That being said, the actual required responsibilities of the job were not difficult to fulfill, but it was expected that we were to always do more than was required of us, as I found out too late."
good,"The people and teams I got to work with were amazing. Great people working very hard together.  Unfortunately, corporate has an almost guaranteed habit of turning to layoffs to boost profit margins for their shareholders."
good,"The coworkers can be great along with the customers, but at times it felt like there was no true management. At the account I was at there wasn't much management contact neither reinforcement our day to day problems. The work can be a breeze as long as you stay cool-headed."
good,"Ik heb ruim een jaar gewerkt voor Xerox en toen sloot de vestiging en werden mensen overgeplaatst of vertrokken. Ik moet zeggen dat ze heel veel moeite deden om mensen goed over te plaatsen. De werksfeer was toen ik er werkte goed. Minder goed was het salaris en de mogelijkheid om een vrije dag op te nemen of te pauzeren of een heel dringend (sterfgeval) persoonlijk telefoontje te plegen. Daar was geen begrip voor. Als je kon ruilen met een collega dan was het geen probleem, maar anders kon je niet vrij nemen, zelfs niet voor examens of andere belangrijke privé zaken. Voor een sterfgeval heb ik wel vrij gehad. Als je ziek bent wordt dit niet gemakkelijk geaccepteerd door het management. Zelfs als ze zelf gezien hebben dat je echt niet kunt werken blijven ze je 3 keer per dag bellen. Een telefoontje missen en je ziekte wordt in twijfel getrokken. Ook dwingen ze je soms om een vrije dag te nemen ipv ziek te melden. Het is heel erg vervelend als je uit moet zieken en je wordt voortdurend gebeld en men doet voortdurend alsof je ´fraudeert´. Soms vertellen ze je ook dat je pijnstillers en dergelijke moet nemen en toch moet komen en accepteren geen nee als antwoord. Er zijn mensen, die zich ziek melden omdat ze geen vrij kunnen krijgen doordat een vrije dag, die niet ingeroosterd is of waar geen vervanging voor is, in principe wordt geweigerd. Ik zelf heb dit nooit hoeven doen. Als ik ziek was, was ik erg ziek en werd ik knetter van hun telefoontjes om weer aan het werk te gaan. Door afschalen kun je onverwacht heel weinig verdienen, wat vervelend is. Men wilde mensen bewust laten"
good,The main goal is to remember that the clients you have are not all the same. You have to be willing to be empathetic to your clients. Keep your task numbers up.
good,"Exactly what you would expect from a customer service Job most supervisors are cool but the people running the place are annoying and overbearing. that's really it,"
good,"If you work hard and learn the position, you will do well. Make sure you come in each day and be productive. Creativity and solutions to problems are encouraged."
good,"Puntual, activa,empatía con con empresa y el cliente"
good,There is no growth in the company. They don't care about the employees. Your coworkers are like family. Management is not bad on certain clients. They need a actual company that cook breakfast and lunch.
good,This particular location was an outsourced call center for Verizon and was all about answering customer calls and trying to manage the cellular services of business accounts.
good,Tasked with providing mail/courier and digital printing services for a top 4 global oil company provided plenty of challenges. Pay was not great. No team building. Management was hit and miss. Like a lot of jobs it was the people you meet that meant the most
good,"This company was okay to work for.  Overall, it's a good place to start but not to finish.  I would recommend for entry level.  The pay was okay, the people you work with is what makes the job."
good,"Enjoyed the work and pay at this job. The overall experience was good, healthcare was good and reasonably priced. Advancement seemed harder to pull off."
good,High volume high stress. opportunity for growth if you are serious and dedicated. Not very competitive pay and the place definitely tests what your made of.
good,"For most of my tenure there, it was a great place to work. In recent years the culture has changed.  Uncertainty looms and motivation is impacted. The people are what in the past made and continue to make the experience most rewarding."
good,"just moved to the area, and needed a little job... the building was not kept up. the environment was nothing to desire for the older mature working class."
good,The company went out of business which no longer there. The company was alright to work at the time I worked there. It was small company the did prescription coverage benefits.
good,Helping fullfill 90 day medications as needed to medicaid and medicare patients for insurance company.  High call volume each day  Ability to work with different supervisors

good,Xerox è un posto di lavoro dove poter crescere professionalmente
good,"I was at Xerox for over 20 years.   I had a wonderful career, worked on some amazing programs and made life long friends. "
good,"Xerox is a very business job. There is always customers that needs help. I enjoy promoting our products to the customers, however the hardest part is when the customer is having problem with their products."
good,I enjoy my full time job working for Xerox. I do not enjoy how there is practically no advancement options working for Xerox. Xerox is a very competitive company... but not when it comes to your Salary. They will pay you as little as possible while still getting you to do a million and one things.
good,The job was okay but they didn't give me a raise for 5 years. I like my bosses but after being there so long in the same job I was bored. There was a lot of driving time which I liked.
good,Busy but fruitful life. Everyday is a brand new day as different challenges might happened and it helps you improve on brainstorming and problem solving skills
good,El trabajo es divertido. Todos siempre intentat sacar una sonrisa de ti.
good,Customer for Life is integral. Great people with focus on innovation and key performance indicators. Industry transformation impacts work life balance.
good,"Xerox would have been a great place if they would not change schedules every three months, I don’t feel that it’s fair for a parent to have to keep making arrangments for a babysitter all becuause they work one shift then they turn around and have to work another shift, if they have set schedules things would be different and it was to much favortism going on there more so of the managers having their favorite picks instead of being equal."
good,"Well, what can I say, it was a good ride for a while. The people are extraordinary and have been run through the coals by management. Print is not dead! I see it reshaping and it will be interesting to see how Xerox reinvents itself."
good,"I really wish the place never closed. Met some great people, including my best friend. Huge family environment, great pay, and lots of incentives for meeting quotas."
good,I worked here years ago and don't remember much about the experience there. I was bored most of the time and the management was a revolving door. Always meeting new managers.
good,"If for any reason the employees have personal or work related issues, the management's doors were always open to help assist make your job better and more productive."
good,"A reasonable company to work for in certain sectors, with regards to IT Support Services not so good as they tend to pile on the workload if you are shown to be good at something without any reward or recognition."
good,"Xerox's sales culture has shifted drastically in the last 20+ years from one of innovation and collaboration to one of stress & confusion. Many in the organization are no longer excited about their company and the products & services they provide, and it tends to show."
good,"As a former employee, it was a good place to start as a first time job. I was part of the financial aid dept, it was organized, and well structured. Anytime a rep needed help, we got it from somebody more experience. Felt as a team."
good,I am a sales rep  The training is all computer based.  The company lacks any corporate directives nor individual directives.  Very isolated as a sales rep.
good,The specific location in Raleigh needs better management and do a have a better process of selecting employees. At times the environment can be toxic to others. The company also had to do a better job of providing for their employees
good,"I worked for Xerox but worked at Procter and Gamble for a short-term project.  The project was for digitalizing written records.  After we showed them how to proceed, our project was ended."
good,aprendi a controlar mis emociones y a fortalecer mi seguridad
good,"Abusive overtime, ridiculous schedule and expectations, CEO unaware of horrible working conditions. Physical location is unsanitary. Uncomfortable chairs an cubicles. Poor training."
good,"Has an OK working atmosphere, but plenty of questions regarding corporate direction.  I feel positioned to advance, but would not want to make a lifelong career working there"
good,"They expect too much for no support.  Need permission to do things with no supervisors to ask.  Then we get docked for high handle times since we cant find a Supervisor to get permission or to ask for help."
good,"Had a long career at Xerox and am thankful for the variety of jobs and training that I was able to take advantage of during that time. The people that work there are helpful and teamwork is part of the culture. In the past 5 years I've seen a steady de-valuation of the employees as they have continually implemented lay-offs and moved the jobs to lower cost locations such as Manila, Guatemala, and Romania. They have also cut benefits significantly."
good,"management was hard to work with. Work was very stressful, face paced and hard to take a day off. No room for advancement opportunities. Keeping up with all the deadlines almost impossible."
good,As an agent it is a fun place to work and as long as you don’t mind stuck up customers your all good. Once you get into management it is a complete mess.

good,"great pay good place to meet new people in your area. fast pace environment on phone calls are non stop, customers could be mean but the pay makes the job work it"
good,"This was a temporary job that I needed to get back on my feet, met a lot of good people during my time working at Xerox, they handle benefits for a large list of clientele and the assignments are typically 6-8 months depending on the team you are hired to work for, they do hire people at the end of the assignment based on your skill sets."
good,I had a great boss and partners in this office and appreciated the opportunity to experience this company.  I hope that I have learned from this and i believe i have been able to use this education in further career opportunities.
good,"	Answers general inquiries for Benefit Wallet benefits and inclusions for old and new employees"
good,"Not much to really share. It was a call center working for Verizon at the time of my employment. The first month and a half is spent in training learning how to work the systems in your department, and the typical situations you will encounter."
good,This job was not bad but and the people you get to meet was very nice and caring very helpful as well the job was not so bad at all over all a good experience.
good,Don't have a review.  I worked in a different state.  Never met my direct manager.  Wasn't paid enough for the work I was doing.  Now I'm getting replaced by a program.
good,"Don't even interview......you'll be gone within a year. Stay away - the benefits SUCK!!! The CEO is un-medicated BIPOLAR. It'll be a shadow if its former self with a year,"
good,his would be a good job for a person who has no kids and this may be your first job other than that I would not work here they will hire people that have been fired before.
good,"I wasn’t crazy about working In call center! It’s very stressful , it was it’s worst around first of month! Your graded by calls and if calls aren’t good your pay sucks ! And if you get to many bad greats your gone it’s almost like being st school they made it very stressful of employees"
good,"This a high profile company that offers different opportunities for career advancement"
good,Company greatest asset is their people - the company is going through a major transformation to meet shareholders   requirement's  .  Although company direction is strategic  is some ways there is employee dissat

good,"Good opportunities are given in this company. I have worked on 6 java applications. "
good,"Veel werk, targets, hoge werkdruk, veel kans op bonussen"

good,Answer phone and assure customer service guaranteed. Enter information into database and enrolled Medicaid applicant into health plan. Forward application to Social services for review.
good,Would come in and just do anything they have. Jobs be sent to a print que and either by phone email or in person I would print out what was needed. Did mainly color printing.
good,the goal is to process as much paperwork as possible because you are paid on a piece rate. I learned how to provide documents for each insurance case daily. There was nothing hard about the job.being able to work  and still have a life outside of work
good,Xerox was a very fast paced hectic environment. I worked there for five years so the initial few years were great and I built some fantastic working relationships. However management change in the last 12 months of me working there which saw the atmosphere change. It was a great place for career development and I learnt some amazing business and life skills through working there.
good,The team was very segregated and no cohesiveness. Everyone was professional but management did not seem approachable. Good location from home but could not shed any light on benefits as I was a contract worker
good,"typical office with steady, and sometimes slow, pace.  pleasant work environment.  extremely large company.  Not many advancement opportunities at entry level."
good,It was my first time working with a call center and it was a great learning experience. If giving the opportunity to work for Xerox again I would take the job in a heart beat.
good,"Dans cette entreprise, nous avons un environnement de travail très agréable. "
good,OK company.  Compensation benefits were very slow and very few bonuses.   They do offer tuition reimbursement if you want to continue your education but in a selective field.
good,Time consuming and time oriented. Projects focused on a completed time frame and done correctly or the result is to have the work redone. This causes the work to be delayed and behind. Management wise is strictly by phone. Culture is time sensitive. Hardest part of job is having work done in timely matter. The enjoyable part of the job is knowing the work is done right no mistakes .
good,i am not working for them i got laid off in march 2018 i took calls from doctors offices to see about payment from medicare patients. the hardest part was when the doctors  got nasty with you when you tell them that there was not a claim on file. was when we could talk to the patients about their plans they have and that we did not get anything from the doctors to pay there bills
good,"They currently seem to be in a MAJOR effort to cut costs, probably in a bid to sell the company.  They do color very well, but beyond that, have lost their innovation edge"
good,"A Fun place to work, and a fast pace work environment, give training with all new products to keep up with new devices to troubleshoot for customer support."
good,Had previously worked for Marriott. Became a Xerox employee when Marriott outsourced. Very unwelcoming and toxic environment. Just an awful place to work with vile people
good,Good Company to Work for with decent benefits and typical 401k and Retirement Plans and Vacation Time. Customer Focus could use some attention but over all a good company
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working for the company in both positions. Considering I came from a totally different background, I was happy, if not surprised they took me on. Had my salary reflected my commute, I might still be there."
good,"Não trabalhei na Xerox, apenas trabalhei em uma empresa que prestava serviços para a mesma"
good,It was a job. It was a relaxed enviornment. No raises. I wouldnt make a career out of it. I at least was able to get a paycheck every week. I wouldnt reccomment it if you are looking for long term.
good,Subs are treated separately from Corporation and like a competitor.  Not a lot of room for advancement.  Not focused on current trends outside of product offerings to leverage advantages.
good,"I started with ACS since 10/4/1994  which was a very exciting company to work for, we had employee appreciation day, employees was rewarded for job performance, Boat shows, Health Fairs and Book Fairs, EastField College did hands on training for improvement (which I loved) and we received certificate of completion, that employees worked harder for a job that appreciate them.  Then we merged with Xerox who took over in 2010, there were a lot of changes that they didn't provide these activities for the employees. In 2017 Xerox went back to what they do best is Printing and copiers and Conduent was now our company which had a massive layoff I was told up to 13k to 17k nationwide. I was part of that Riff which was very hurtful, I really loved my job as a Operations Manager for over 21 years with Fannie Mae, Colonial and Sonymae.  If there are any job openings with Xerox I would love to come back to work."
good,"fast paced and stressful, if you let it, but it can be rewarding. Various locations around so you don't have to get stuck in one area.Great for high school kids."
good,This is a job that most people don't last long at. People come in with one expectation and its totally different for the most part its an easy job but don't expect any superior pay
good,Reasonably good work environments and hours. Lots of corporate training. Opportunities for movement within the company around the  nation.  Good benefits offers.
good,"Work was stressful at times with management and/or employees. No room for advancement. Very tedious and non-fulfilling. Needed to find somewhere where I could learn and grow, but overall it wasn't a bad place to work."
good,"As my experience,I don’t like the pay,no incentives"
good,Xerox was a large corporation but with a family oriented business mentality.  The new management team is changing the culture and is no longer the place we learned to love.
good,Seems like every year a new company will come and be under a new contract. Always something changing within this company and you the employer don't know about it till the last minute
good,it wasn't so much that the company itself was to blame for my bad experience. Call centers aren't for everyone and you have to be ready to take verbal abuse on a daily (almost hourly) rate. The company itself tried its best to make it a better work place but nothing could make the customers better.
good,A typical day at the office was a lot of incoming and outgoing phone calls.  I worked for the business class department of Verizon.  That was more enjoyable then the standard calls.  I was able to help a lot more people and made sure that their businesses were able to run accurately and efficiently.
good,"When you are a part of Xerox, you become part of a team of ambitious and motivated professionals,We’re always eager to learn new things, collaborate with new people and explore new possibilities."
good,Answer phones and help clients. The hardest part of working there was that they were more interested in the number of calls then the customer service aspect.
good,Call volume varies. Ok wages. Project varies based on availablity on site. Open work environment . Ok Wages. Management is fair. Hours are acceptable.
good,"While I was at Xerox, I was able to feel comfortable and enjoy what I was doing. Unfortunately, I was not able to grow within the company. My manager ""cut my wings"" and told me that he needed me to stay in his team so he would not let me grow."
good,"It was good experience but wouldn't recommend working here, lack of leadership and very stressful environment. Great to gain experience working for the state"
good,"I worked there a long time ago, so I'm hoping since then they have made some improvements. The job wasnt that bad they were just making too many changes that interfered with my livelihood."
good,En lo particular mi supervisor era una persona muy accesible
good,"I worked in different departments my favorite was Quality Assurance"
good,"No Comments.  This was a great company to work for when it was part of a joint venture with General Electric.  After that was dis banned the company began to offshore jobs, including mine."
good,I learned how create and rewrite contracts.
good,"There are outsourcing and offshoring efforts eliminating onsite jobs. Only critical functions US based, all other handled offshore. 80% of the day is wasted in non-productive meetings."
good,Great place to work or Stabley should really get friendships positive environment group effort teamwork company games and challenges as well as taking care of all the android customers out in the world who needed tech-support or refunds or anything along those lines. Exciting place full of enthusiasm  hey got shut down we got laid off and they relocated.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of several project meetings;  multitasking during most meetings to ensure your actions are on target for the next meeting or project ."
good,"I was hired as junior contractor, with no benefits, I loved the environment and my team leader was excellent, but I was contractor, and the pay was for the position.  I took the position, because I lost my job at Kodak, and did not want to be unemployed.  I stayed until I found a position at RGH"
good,fast paced and high volume of calls. if you enjoy being on the phone with angry customers then this is the job for you. If you enjoy being around angry people this is also th job for yon
good,"* i learn a lot of new things. especially in customers. we handle various type of customers from various type of country "
good,My drive was long … I worked 3:00 to 11:30 … the project was temporary and absorbed after a year into another department. It was good to move on from this position.
good,"Small cubicles, no soundproofing, loud agents, poor environmental controls.  Not the ideal working situation for trying to help customers calling in for technical help."
good,"práce poměrně psychicky vyčerpávající a neúměrné finanční ohodnocení. domnívám se také, že operátorům péče o zákazníky by klidně mohli nabídnout i více dní dovolené, přece jen je to práce, kde je člověk opravdu pod psychickým tlakem a hodí se pak mít prostor pro více odpočinku."
good,"This was my first job in a sales based organisation. I joined as technical support and the role changed to sales."
good,Would not recommend making this a career job. staff unprofessional. lots of young kids and young minded adults on the job. not too many real growth opportunities.
good,"Long hours"
good,Een flexibel bedrijf waar je genoeg kunt leren en fijn werksfeer hebt
good,Xerox was an okay place to work.  I feel as though the salary could have been better for the amount of work done.  The management at the time I was employed there could have been better.
good,Management was great and Typical day at work is lots of work and less break times. Provided great training during initial stage.Workplace culture is casual and fun at work. Learned about medicaid insurance and how to deal with all type of customer on the phone.
good,"Pros"
good,It is an opportunity to learn information if you are willing.can take experience elsewhere into a job within the medical insurance field can experience of providing customer service.
good,It was a call center for a bank in California. It was a fast pace call center you were constantly busy. If you like the call center lifestyle you'll love working for Xerox.
good,This company has lots of campaigns to apply to. Good seasonal jobs. It is pretty easy to move up in the company but some locations employed some unprofessional people. Stay focused on task and making the money you desire and keep looking. You can always apply again when campaigns end.
good,"A typical day at work would all depemds  on the latest apple product or software update to determine if the day will laid back, or phones rringing nonstop"
good,Answered incoming calls for customers with issues. Most customers call in angry because their phone isn't working or they can't get service. The hardest part of the job is getting passing surveys.
good,Very good people work at Xerox...very caring. Strong learning is offered...sometimes they forget about the customer and make decisions that hurt the true value of the company.
good,Was definitely not the same thing day in and day out. Kept it interesting. I had a lot of repeat customers that would ask for me by name. they do believe in team work. When I had a death in the family the sent me an empathy card because I couldn't take off work. Saturdays and Sundays were always the most interesting days.
good,"Mission intéressante, tant par l'amélioration des outils mis à disposition sinon ..."
good,"Typical day involved preparing meals, cleaning apartment, running errands, and providing general caregiving and company as a personal aide to my disabled client."
good,"Managed a staff of 13 associates in a high volume, fast paced environment. Led weekly status meetings to review work volumes, review established metrics, and discuss new opportunities to increase efficiencies in work methods."
good,"Day would begin at a certain time and you had to be clocked in and at your desk ready to take phone calls within 5 minutes. Training was touch and go as was advancement chances. Taking calls was okay but, you had to tread carefully, with angry callers. Xerox needs a better way to track and rate the CSR they have on surveys."
good,I would only recommend a person to work at Xerox when they are in need of a job until what they desire becomes available. The experience as a 1st time customer service rep was bitter sweet. I enjoyed the customers more than the employees and management. Lack of organization and obvious nepotism.
good,The coworkers kept the moral. There was mandatory work schedules that became grueling.  The didn't give raises because they felt the overtime made up for it.
good,Xerox/ Verizon was a good place to work great people to work with.Had the opportunity to speak with a variety of people and see different prospectives.
good,"My time at the employer was through a temp agency. I enjoyed my time there and actually had two assignments at the same location. The team I worked with was very informative and helpful. Although my first assignment consisted of me working independently, I never felt like I was alone during the assignment. I always had a colleague that I could go to for assistance."
good,"n/a not very much to say. Not a hard place to work, the job itself was easy. I enjoyed the work. Not all of the management should have been management."
good,Working with some fun and caring people made my transition to Customer Care Specialist easy. I learned that people choose mail order pharmacy to save money and have their medications shipped directly to their door. The most difficult part of this type of work is being talked to negatively and remembering that we are there to serve the sick and shut in. It was always a pleasure when the customer asked to rate me with my supervisor and informed them of how kind and concerned I treated them.
good,The job was decent and had decent benefits. It is fast paced and can be stressful at times. Sometimes you feel like just a number and not a person. The pressure to hit certain stats can be overwhelming at times
good,"Xerox is now Conduent so I'm not sure of the culture currently; however, when I worked there the management did not care about you. You were only a body in a seat helping to make them look good,."
good,Structured environment and detailed training.  Support available and adequate.  Comfortable offices and advanced phone system.  Computer systems above average.
good,repetitive
good,"I like working for Xerox.. the Atmosphere was nice, and I learned a  lot of things while employed there.  The people there were simply amazing. I hated to see the company close our location."
good,"This company shows very little regard for their employees, and will take every opportunity to cut earnings.  While promotion from within the company was encouraged, commensurate pay increases were very rare."
good,"Solution Partner Manager"
good,"all though i enjoyed my time there, the turn around that they had with the managers there was not nice and did not help the company stay less stressful."
good,"Good first job, I learned a lot about sales. I just was not passionate about the line of work or the product they were selling. It is a great first job and I appreciate what I learned there"
good,There was a never ending list of tasks put on the the client managers.  This is a high turnover position due to stress and very long hours. No work/life balance.
good,I learned how to do data entry very quickly and accurately we were expected to do so many strokes per hour which was very challenging at times but overall it was a great learning experience if you wanted to build your keying skills up.
good,I would start the day by connecting to the call logs and making sure that everything would connected correctly. Making my daily requirement for calls and issues to handle. 
good,The work flow was consistent and t/job was easy to understand. Enjoyed the paid time off and discounts. My co-workers were always helpful/considerate.
good,"the job pays the bills, its always something better, but its a job you can climb up the later if that's something you wanted to do. improves can take action"
good,"Badge in to a secure building, check on my production staff and work area to monitor the workflow and staffing. Go to my office and login into the network. Monitor and respond to client calls and emails as well as leadership calls and emails as needed to keep business moving forward. Provide for the business acumen for my operation, communicate changes, upgrades and new business to my global workforce in seven countries. Lead new business projects with cross functional teams to insure all requirements needed are met and the projects are implemented correctly and on time. Coordinate with development staff, networks staff, IT support staff, finance and leadership as needed to ensure workflow was meeting service level agreements. Manage all breakage, system lag, project lag, customer concerns, equipment failures and staffing issues successfully and timely. Provide weekly outlook for finance, IT refresh needs and business direction with leadership. Maintain client confidence and service delivery directly with my clients. Prepare and deliver accurate and timely reports and communications as need for sustaining my global operation. Follow up with the production team to maintain our secure and balanced working environment is meeting expectations and then close for the day."
good,una empresa con buenas prestaciones pero es muy dificil ser promovido a una nueva posicion
good,"This job was a good way to get your foot in the door to do office work, i did call center work before getting a job in an office and it was a good way to get experiance"
good,"A typical day at work would be faced paced while maintaining quality with the quantity of the calls. What I loved about this job was the push for quality, the hardest part of the job was the amount of pay for the amount of work and stress."
good,"my time at Xerox wasn't bad, some of the managers were first time managers so they tried to act like big shots, 1 hour for lunch isn't bad, ive heard they pay more now"
good,"Good location for office, many benefits were offered, Overtime was offered.  I learned how to process defined benefits for the division we were contracted to."
good,Pretty good work place. Salary is competitive. Management is pretty friendly. Job is pretty relaxed. Training is extensive and thorough. Overall good place to work for.
good,"I enjoyed helping customers with any questions or concerns they may have over their wireless account. If a customer was angry, I was always able to calm them down with my tone of voice and the information I was able to offer."
good,"company is well respected, they offer work from oppurtunities however salary isn't that competitive, worked there for some time was promised advancement oppurtunities in the beginning but that just fell through the cracks"
good,"You were overworked for minimal pay. Some of the people there were very unfriendly  But there were a few that I enjoyed working with.  I was not all bad I did enjoy working with some of the people just a very few that were unfriendly,"
good,"It has good benefits, and good accommodations for working. They provide all supplies and coffee and tea form the employees.  Management is OK, depending on the team you are in."
good,"As the title says the workplace is not the best but not the worst.  The good is that you can work almost unlimited hours if you want to.  The bad would be that it feels that the business was poorly managed.  If there was some improvements here and there it could have been a business that didn't need to be shut down.  The training was acceptable but the later training and development was almost non existent, unless it was for a reprehend.  There wasn't to many problems with management."
good,I have worked for the company for 5 years. I have had several different changes in management and campaigns. I wish not to give a review.   Have nothing to say about the company
good,"After you get through an amazing month of training is when you realize how much this job is about enduring people yelling at you.  Please don't go into this job if you have a low self esteem or are prone to ulcers.  Ulcers run rampant in the department I was at.  It seemed most people didn't address their stress levels and thought they were okay.  "
good,Got to learn various reports and the audit process. Got familiar with being detail orientated and enjoyed working with co-workers. The pay was very low.
good,"Overall Xerox was a great company to work for.  I worked remotely so not a lot of office interaction with my daily work.  The company that I worked for was purchased by Xerox, so I was re-badged under the Xerox name."
good,The daily work was enjoyable.  The hardest part of the job was training courses which did not pertain to your specific job.  First level managers were the best ranking high but levels 2 and 3 they received low ratings.
good,"Xerox is a great company to work with. Xerox has great training and the people around are friendly and very helpful. The company offers good incentives to workers, as well."
good,Typical day at work:  Mostly do your work and attend meetings when they are scheduled.
good,Bosses and colleagues are very helpful and keep a positive attitude. Training is thorough and detailed. Company is a known and established brand in the Printing Industry.
good,"xerox was a company ran off of different campaigns, that usually lasted no more than six month and they hire so many people at one time that the turn over rate is high, at the end of six month only about 10 to 15 people are chosen to stay on but they hire well over 100 people campaign. I don't think its a great place to work but you can a lot of work experience from working there and also obtain few skills as well"
good,"Gives you good exposure to corporate world. "
good,"Xerox is a good place to work as far as gaining experience in a call center atmosphere. On a typical day there, you will take roughly 35-50 calls while, being recorded, timed and graded on each. You will also be navigating mutiple computer systems while on calls. This job can be stressful being that its production driven. The best thing about this job is the incentive pay you receive when you meet expectations in different areas."
good,Xerox was recently acquired by Fuji Film. Xerox lost it's innovative culture and had become too hidebound and slow to respond to business condition changes
good,Large company that appears more focused on the bottom line than employee satisfaction.  Middle management has a lot of undue pressure to achieve goals/numbers that appear unrealistic.
good,"always busy"
good,"Learned a lot about Medicare and Medicaid insurance, which inspired me to go back to school to work within the medical insurance and assist in helping those that do not know about insurance and help determine what coverage is best coverage possible for the patient."
good,"Fun place work, with great people. Management and training needed improvement. I enjoyed my work and co-workers. Projects were not secured for more than six months at a time making the job high risk."
good,Calls back to back depending on skill set. Very easy job. Management needs to be more professional. Learned a lot about health insurance. Need  to have a flexible schedule.
good,"This job was ok for the money they paid, only thing I didn't like is that one of the managers when you made a mistake would yell it to the whole call center and it was a bit much."
good,"Willing to assist members & resolve their issues. Customer oriented ready to please members. "
good,"bonne boite ... un peux trop ""fermée"" sur les procédures ...."
good,"The work job and relaxed and slow. It's a good simple job that pays well, but as a contract, there is no room to get promotions or get a raise. So its hard to not want to look while keeping this job."
good,Some jobs are more challenging than other and job security is not that great now like it used to be. Lots of jobs are being sent to off shore locations.
good,Great Company! Great coworkers! You have lots of opportunities if you apply yourself! The most enjoyable part of the job is working side by side with the customer.
good,Ok compabybsecrnt pay but draining hours. Feels like school. No freedom a lot of micromanagement sometimes drama and also the campaign could end at moments notice
good,"They allowed me to work from home after being with the company for 10 years and proving my reliability.  Because of not having a bachelor's degree, I was unable to receive the job title or compensation that I should have from Xerox.   There really weren't many advancement opportunities for me after plateauing in the position that I was in as a senior payroll assistant.   I had a few good managers at the site that I worked for.  The last manager that I had really didn't seem to care much about managing his department unfortunately.   That reflected negatively on the department.  Our site ended up losing our contract to another bidder which ultimately ended up costing me my job.   I did receive severance pay for a few months, but not near enough for the years that I served this company.  Overall, not a terrible place to work if you are able to find a position that allows you to work from home.   This makes up for the lack of compensation and recognition."
good,Call center job opportunity providing the opportunity to work in mail order pharmacy filling prescriptions for customers according to guidelines. It allowed you the satisfaction of knowing you had helped someone be able to receive their medications.
good,"Buena experiencia laboral, solo falto que pudieran mantener el contrato por un periodo mayor."
good,"Warm place, easy to get, no rush. Good for getting qualifications. Interesting if you are in technician staff. Nice people around, mostly. Pioneers in field."
good,Xerox remains one of the few legacy companies based in the United States. There struggle at re-branding from a copier company to a services company remains a challenge
good,"Xerox could be more helpful during training . To help with learning their business to provide more customer service, especially with the humana department ."
good,"Xerox, had a high turn around rate. The employees didn't stay long once hired. Mostly because the pay rate wasn't competitive. However, the Pharmacist made pretty good money."
good,"Trabajaba en la provincia de Salamanca y los compañeros de trabajo eran muy agradables. Teníamos un excelente ambiente laboral. Aprendí técnicas de venta y cultura de empresa, ya que Xerox se encargaba de formarnos a conciencia para transmitir al cliente que era la compañía del documento. Lo más difícil era cumplir los objetivos, si bien, había siempre apoyo por parte de la dirección. Lo que más me gustaba era hacer visitas con los compañeros a clientes."
good,"I would answer phone calls from customers who needed help understanding the bill, having problems with their device, changing their plan, and also ordering new devices or accessories for their phone.  The employees where very nice and was a very environment to work in. Was stressful at times when customers were irate about the bill or over charges."
good,This company has made many changes over the last 15 years. Its nothing close to being the top company it once was. Management seems to be always scrambling to get quick answers to feed to senior management who does not seem to have any sense of direction. The CEO over the last several years had no clue.
good,"overall i enjoyed working here, as a company it could use some new policy/procedures put in place for everyone to follow  so that they have more structure and consistency in place"
good,"worked on different campaigns like sprint, Aetna and Silver script  answered incoming calls assisted customers with their accounts took payments troubleshoot equipment and so much more ."
good,I worked at one of the Romanian offices. Any feedback I might have would not necessarily apply to the company culture in the UK. Same goes for the ratings.
good,"We were able to work a ton of overtime if we wanted to, but the benefits for our pay rate was entirely too low for all the different tasks that some of us had to learn. "
good,"Rules are stringent, but reasoning for rules seemed to match the environment.  The environment could use a change, however, to something more collaborative and less order driven"
good,Great people to work with and for. Relaxed but busy customer service center. Pay is competitive in that particular field. Training is available and overall experience is good.
good,"it was clear that the company was over-extended, saddled with debt and the layoffs began almost instantly. Contracts were lost or renegotiated, management and operations were cut back, and they came for HR/Recruiting after 6 months."
good,Working in multiple locations. Working with multiple podiatrists who care for the patients. Inputting patient information into their data basis. Foot care.
good,Just another call center. Lots of sitting(not a fan of). I'm personally not sitting kind of person like an active job. Break schedule was not okay. You had to hold it if you needed to go to the rest room. I can not hold my bladder for long periods of time because I've had kindney surgery and its not good for your kidneys to hold it for long periods of time.
good,Overall good place to work the most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers with different insurance questions and feeling like you are making a difference in some ones life..
good,Een baan je veel geduld voor nodig hebt. Momenten waar je voor jezelf op moet komen maar niet brutaal moet overkomen
good,customer service engineer/ color analyst repairing and upgrading digital color printers and copiers. many way too many hours spent driving do to large geographic area
good,"I've learn a lot from working there and everyone that I worked with got along and we had fun while working, but got the job done. I had to sort the mail for the different floors and regions and the deliver it"
good,"Working at Xerox was a great experience for me."
good,"I enjoyed working there, but there was always an excuse for have of the stall not showing up for work.. I didn't have a problem working over timer, but I know themajority did.  I would do it again."
good,Can be a bit hectic when the call volume gets high. Supervisor was not too good with the system and liked picking on the workers and befriend the ones who can do her work for her.
good,"Learned a lot while working there. However, when the Contract ended, things changed quickly. Needed something more secure. ABC compensation plan wasn't favorable."
good,Never had issues with the company just started working there at an inopportune time. Sprint changed a plan and all I dealt with is cancellations. Besides that ok company.
good,Xerox is a great company but it takes a long time for you to see good money out of it. To sell printing devices is not as easy as it looks. It takes time to have a stablished clientele.
good,I didn’t work here that long but the time I was there wasn’t very educational and it was to much other stuff going on and not enough working. I wouldn’t recommend this place for a long standing career/job.
good,"The company contracted for a home delivery pharmacy, so you were on the phones taking calls from patients usually above the age off 65. The patients attitude varied greatly between each call."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job were my teammates who became really close friends to me and although we do not work together anymore we still stay in touch.
good,Great management skills development company. Managers are expected to take upon responsibility above and beyond. Pay does not measures to responsibility
good,"Was an account within a larger corporation - convenient location and easy to commute. Good environment, opportunity for growth at times. Work consistent."
good,"A typical day at work is doing all copy jobs, all kind of binding. And doing the in and outgoing mail. And I would deliver the mail and the packages. And at the end of the day I would have to total up all of my copy jobs and all my mail delivery."
good,"The company overall is good. However, the stability of the company is stressful because the company bids on contracts that typically last from 3-5 years. Much of the first year is learning the new processes and policies. Management is constantly training and this includes employee. By the time you learn your job, the contract is up for renewal and the company is on edge worrying whether jobs will be eliminated for not. Job security is always a big, big concern."
good,The Xerox XRC was a document copying service.  We worked with different clients such as large corporations and Law offices in copying and storing their data.
good,Great co-workers but long hours with no outlook for breaks.  They always run behind on projects which makes life stressful with too many mandatory saturdays.
good,"Enormément appris dans cette structure"
good,"The pay is good. The training is good. The operating systems they use to handle customer calls is grossly out of date, inefficient, and completely counter intuitive and makes handling customer inquiries and issues a much more difficult task. Could definitely use an upgrade from the convoluted programs they force you to learn. There are many tools you learn about that are not covered in training. Some supervisors are wonderful and helpful, others are egotistical and have a chip on their shoulder."
good,answering questions from customers and looking for a satisfactory fix for it. working in a group to learn from each other and help as needed to help customers
good,Kunden weiter helfen. Technische Lösungen finden und dabei Vorteile  was man extra kaufen kann.
good,Loved fast pace environment.  Diverse workforce.  Nice people and management were pretty good.  Did put good money into technology - no junk.  Had ample supplies
good,"very busy work zone, answering inbound calls all day, dealing with customers all day pharmacy medical billing and enrollment claims, "
good,Amazing job if you need one now. They will hire just about anyone and it's not that bad. It gets a bad wrap but overall is great place to work. Decent pay and room for growth after awhile.
good,"Even though my job was stressful, I still went above and beyond. Working with the managers was stressful but I enjoyed it."
good,It was a very fast paced work place. Production of claims were monitored on a daily basis. At the same time it was a fun and energizing atmosphere. Only left because the company closed for reason of losing contract
good,Okay work environment.  Work from home was available which worked out the best for me personally. flexibility is good. Low pay. management is worked as a team.
good,productive good training  set schedule the down side that the jobs are project base great break room great place to learn about medical insurance policy
good,"Supported servers an clients at the time, changed from a completely trusted domain to resource, application, users domain .Boulevard of the Allies and Oxford Center"
good,"I told already that Xerox moved to the Mexico, People likes work here. Great benefits, top technology, interested job ability to go to school to study"
good,"The training and development of this organization is very good! In addition, I had two great managers! Everything else was luke warm regarding compensations, culture and etc"
good,the project had to close and there were hundreds of employees laid off i had to find another job that i like like this one i also got great experience from here
good,it was ok you have to work to pay yourself not a hourly rate. so if there is no work your pay is decrease. so we have to always have job to do. Wish it wasn't like that.
good,"Very good environment, wouldve been alot better if the pay was competitive and you have the option on what shift you waned to work at the end of the day"
good,"The support or people getting paid in order for you to make your job the right way, are actually making it worse "
good,"Flexibilidad por parte de la direccion y estabilidad son los grandes pros, un sueldo muy bajo y las nulas posibilidades de promocion son los principales contras."
good,Paid training with a raise when you advance to the prediction floor. Doctors notes for illness do not excuse absence. Excellent benefits and discounts available for employees.
good,"It was ok working there, but I got laid off after 15 years of service with zero warning.  The culture was fine.  Work-life balance was good.  Able to work from home quite often."
good,"Good, not bad."
good,"Pros"
good,Nice people but multiple changes in company direction and management with frequent off-shoring of roles and downsizing. Much uncertainty with unanticipated changes due to quarterly revenue announcements.
good,they need better management. they never knew what they were doing. the hours are great and so is the pay but they need more balance and order in that business.
good,I was there at Xerox for approximately 8 weeks per the contract they had. There was a Manager there that discriminated against me and when the contract expired. I was let go.
good,Go and do your job focus on what it is that you are there for. There is great money to be made there just not for my preference. Great way to get started
good,Very fast paced and had to deal with many angry customers and I got cussed out all day. It was mentally hard. But some people can handle a job as such.
good,"Tomar llamadas"
good,el manejo de sistemas para monitorear los horarios y los tiempo en los que los agentes tiene que estar trabajando
good,this job was very detail oriented with different rules for different clients that were constantly changing from day to day. Very tedious with little redeeming qualities. lots of turnover.
good,"Long hours, but not a stressful environment. No incentives was the problem for me. Motivating employees can make a big difference in how they perform their jobs. Movie tickets, monthly raffles and free lunches, these are nice ways to show appreciation."
good,"The work environment was positive and upbeat, but unfortunately the government lost their contract and I was laid off from work.  It was fairly easy work and easy to move up if you came to work and did your job. "
good,"False promises"
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, lo principal es brindar la mejor atención a cada uno de los clientes, sumado a esto realizar correctamente los trabajos solicitados cumpliendo en tiempo y forma."
good,Over the course of a decade people have retired without backfilling the positions. It appears that the direction of the company is to outsource the service department to third party organizations.
good,very fast paced job you had to have a lot of patience. Can become a little stressful as the calls come pouring in. some days the calls are nonstop others its ok
good,"It's a very unprofessional workplace. Management changes every few months. There's room for advancement, however. the company is very unorganized so accepting more responsibility would be very stressful, given that's the situation."
good,"Era un trabajo algo complicado, pero con un buen ambiente en el area."
good,"Face paced call center for sprint. Hard to advance, no paid time off. Answered high volume of calls from sprint customers, dealt with billing issues and tried to resolve issues in a timely manner"
good,Working at Xerox was an experience for me to gain knowledge in the healthcare sector. (CareSource). The experience allowed me to use multiple databases to help Xerox's clients.
good,Understaffed lots of chiefs and management disagreed a lot in front of team. Unprofessional management and the company cores were not in tune with the company mission.
good,"It is a OK place to work. I met a lot of people that I still communicate with to this day. There is a big turnover rate. The schedules are set, and are bid upon."
good,"I learned about HIPAA policy"
good,"Working at Xerox has been a great work experience, especially for this to be by first job that I ever worked at in my life. I learned so many technical terms and troubleshooting steps for wireless devices it was so amazing. Xerox will always be a company that made a big impact on my life.Some of the employers are kind and really care about your success. So if your looking for a company to grow in Xerox would be a great company to start."
good,"Xerox is a contract employer. Productive place to work, however with contract jobs your employment could end at any time if the contractor is not happy."
good,"The trainer was excellent. But when was hired on, was hired on for a different job then told and was not expecting all the training required for it. They were not clear on everything about the job."
good,"Great people to work with, projects where interesting and challenging. I would for this place again. The flex schedule and ability to work virtual was huge benefit at this point in my life"
good,"Ok place to work, but you have to know a lot of computer systems and be prepared to not get as much help as promised once you start taking calls. People were friendly, some were unprofessional but overall a decent experience."
good,"It can be better poor management and this company will hire anybody. It is very loud there some employees have no respect for the managers or for the others workers. This company will not give you your bonus that you earn when promise. The rules will change"
good,"Tijdens mijn werk bij Xerox voornamelijk voor de opdrachtgever Lotto heb ik verschillende skills opgedaan, zowel in- als outbound bellen. Retentie, winback en koude verkoop voornamelijk."
good,It was a good job for me at the time.  The people are friendly and they usually work around any issues an employee may have. There were contests and employees were given the chance to win prizes.
good,"Don't want to pay you nothing for your hard work. Pay is no good!!"
good,"Help customers over the phone as they need help with their e-zpass account, weather is was to put money on their account or to help them with a violation."
good,"Poca oiportunidad de crecimiento, mi estadia fue corta ya que el empleo fue temporal, sin embargo al estar contestando llamadas sin descanso se siente un desgaste muy grande"
good,En lo personal se me hace una empresa donde puedes realizar tu trabajo sin ningún inconveniente!
good,I am having a friendly and stress less working environment. We have enough freedom to complete our work and taking additional responsibilities. More opportunities to learn other processes also.
good,"to much work .always overload."
good,l learned about the new systems they have. Management is not that great. They don't value there staff. Cultured work place. Short lunches 7 breaks....
good,"was when you worked 13 our shifts, felt like you never got a break. The call center in general was a great place to work, people was excellent. They was just a great company in general."
good,"Decent company to work for, however their clients can be a little demanding. Management is fair and co-operative. Pension, benefits paid time off, etc."
good,"You can come in there looking crazy like you just woke up and they will not send you home. The work is easy and fun at times when your competing with your teammates for sales. It was overall a cool job, i just hate they took out the cooks."
good,"I have an obviously jaded opinion of this company as I was let go after informing 2 managers of having to go for a second biopsy."
good,"The work conditions are often subject to change without much notice, there's lots of parking available onsite for workers. Supervisors and trainers are very helpful."
good,"8 hours per day on phone with headset, incoming calls,every minute scrutinized, phone calls reviewed, every word is recorded,every bathroom break,every break,lunch time monitored."
good,"The part of Xerox that I worked for handled the Part D prescription Drug plan for Medicare and Medicaid. Explaining retirement to a society that has worked their entire life some of them since they were 15 years of age can be quite difficult.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to help one person understand their benefits upon retiring from the workforce, or to assist them with getting approval for medication that is required for their everyday life"
good,I work in the mailroom and scanning. I worked part-time which i like because i care for my kids. I had half hour lunch break 15 mins break in the afternoon
good,great people. fast environment. long training. great for career advancing. flexible. comfortable clothing is allowed. test required for before getting hired
good,I learn aspect of the company that will help me further my future.  The job was not a difficulty job some days it had it's challenge due to the system was running slow or would not come up.
good,the benefits are not bad but too many people coming and going but you can learn a lot of about benefits. Its a good place if you are look for a temp job but long tern its hard to keep
good,The workplace culture was horrible because we where required to do a lot of work for a low pay with no recognition from management.  No good benefits.
good,No better or worse than working for any other call center.  Xerox has acceptable pay and decent benefits if you can get past the club atmosphere you may enjoy working here.
good,It was a small guinea pig internship for others of my age at the time. Every intern was a daughter or son of a parent who worked there. It was a 2 to 3 week experience but we managed to get the job done within a week and a half.
good,Take inbound calls. all calls must be 2 minutes or less you have verify the customer info and resolve the patients issue within the two minute time frame.
good,"There were always changes working for this company that I never agreed or disagreed with. I started working here very you, though I really did not enjoy my time there I am sure it helped me in developing skills for the future of my career."
good,"Typical Call center, dealing with those with Apple devices... Management needed some work, hard part was just learning the product. I did have to wonder about some of the people they hired."
good,"The job teaches you in a firm way how to handle customers. There are very challenging people to work with, however, it is able to be done if needed. I had a great supervisor who helped me through my job."
good,"Typical call center style, hire anyone without question then 3/4 of the people leave. Get burned out easily, 100 calls a day goals. Customers are always mad."
good,"Embora achava que merecia ganhar um pouco mais, gostava de trabalhar na empresa, pois era bastante comunicativa com as pessoas e ágil nas atividades diárias, trabalhei com fechamentos de caixa, sai do emprego porque tinha que estudar .Tinha facilidade de trabalhar em grupo, patrão muito compreensivo e fácil de lidar."
good,"Chill job just gets boring and not really a lot of room to advance "
good,"To obtain a position that offers challenge, growth, responsibility, and career opportunity. To be able to engage myself within a company which I can contribute in the fulfillment of each vision and while utilizing and enhancing my skills and knowledge in the field of Electrical Engineering, Health Safety and Environment and Quality."
good,Learned Medicare enrollment information in preparation for early open enrollment for retirees. Was a fast paced customer oriented environment. Have a better understanding of human resources.
good,"they breath down your throat about time on calls and not all customers are gonna be short they really contradict themselves like be quiet but then say be out spoken dont cut off the customers but tell you to ""grab the conversation even if the customer is talking"" just to confusing"
good,"Not a place that you can turn into any kind of career. But I think they still let you go home early a lot so that is a plus, right? Also, no one really takes anything seriously."
good,answer questions from providers about clients health ins and also sale health insurance.  most providers were nice. the ones that out source had rude people calling. the telesales part was what i enjoyed. selling insurance to the clients was what i was hired for.s
good,I've not worked at Xerox in over 20 years. That work location relocated to Tampa FL and there has a been a complete change in personnel. It would be unfair to current job seekers to provide a review on work and a culture that is dissimilar to what may exist now.
good,"Xerox is a good company to work but no work form home is allowed. Management is good and caring. have good working environment. have short contracts, this"
good,"Good to work can learn a lot employees orient company flexible timings individual attention is given on the performance I was given full responsibility of the SBU client interaction day to day quality TAT update to client etc.,"
good,The job was hard when you had difficult customers but difficult customers were rare most the people who i talked to didnt understand bill i enjoyed explaining their bill to them
good,Ik vind het niet prettig om dit via de pc te doen.
good,"Working at Xerox was a unparalleled experience  "
good,This division is now owned by Conduent Inc.  Factory like setting with emphasis on quantity NOT quality resulting in large quality group because too many correction issues.  No management structure.  Dress codes ignored and much too much nepotism.15
good,"This job was defiantly one of my most interesting jobs. Being on the phone for 12 hours a day dealing with peoples issues isn't for everyone. I had a hard time with people being generally rude and demanding on the phone with me, but I did have some positive experiences there as well."
good,"Logging into multi systems, handling incoming calls from members."
good,I wouldn't be able to answer that question about the company I feel like for the first time that I worked in a call center should of been more organized with information that we were given
good,"At my last job with  with randstad was"
good,"Over the years that i was at Xerox my fellow employees were easy "
good,"the break rooms were very dirty and had bugs, mice and bed bugs. The working conditions were gross. The company did nothing to clean or make repairs.  Or to upgrade anything."
good,My research colleagues were great to work with.  They were dedicated and passionate about their area of research.  My immediate managers were supportive.
good,Personally will not work there again. due to always have to change seatting and share headsets people were constantly getting sick. so if you value your health don't work there.
good,"Every day Xerox lays off employees that have been with the company for years.  Letting go these employees is also permanently damaging the future of Xerox as many of these employees have so much knowledgeable and experience that cannot be saved for future business retention and growth.  "
good,I worked for this company for the lsat 9 years. Earned a great experience. It is an honor to work with professional people who value life and prioritize commitment.
good,the pay is never the same and can go up and down.. The supervisors at Xerox state and local shows a liking in who they want to work there. Supervisors changes every few years and th
good,It has a great environment to work. The people are ok to work with. I get along with everyone that I work with. I am very friendly and very helpful. My coworker are a team player.
good,Xerox has so many different types of companies that you could work for that its pretty good to work there while in college or even a first job. The only problem is every company inside of Xerox is under contract and could end at any given moment.
good,XEROX-ACS was initially just supposed to be a job to fill the void of being in transition from one job to the next.  Upon applying and getting into the training I learn very quickly that customer service was something that I had the nack for.  I learned the information quickly and was great with the customers.  I became a keeper of time and grasped the concept of what it took to win the customer's over.  XEROX gave me skills that I can take with me to any job.  XEROX is a great starter job and a fantastic place to learn great if you are willing to be open and receptive.
good,I am grateful for my time here at Xerox and now it is time for me to move forward with new experiences. I would recommend this company because of how balanced it is.
good,"When i worked there, i heard multiple people saying how they did not like working there. But if you are a customer service person and have a great personality no matter what time of the day, this would be a perfect job for you. As well as taking many many calls all day long."
good,to answer phone and assist the customer in answering their question about how to place their order. how long the order would take to arrive. set them up for email communication when needed. let them know the benefits of using the online account as well as the mail order service. help the customer understand the benefits that were available to them.
good,low pay for the amount of work you do. the breaks were only 10 mins. so barley enough time to go to bathroom. but break room did have tv and pool table
good,"The past 3 years at Xerox were a great learning experience.  It was the first time working in a call center. Although I have worked in the customer service area before it was different. At Xerox I was answering phone calls for 10 hours a day. We were responsible for every call that comes to our headset and had no control over what call comes in. I was a resolution manager who will assist customer service reps with their phone calls, or the customers would request to speak with management to have their issue resolved and which will be me."
good,Xerox contracts with different vendors so there are several campaigns to work with. A typical day at Xerox is what you make of it. You as an individual control your success with the company.
good,"Working here gave me the experience to assist callers in a professional manner"
good,"High volume inbound call center. very fast past and detail orientated. we would answer the call and input client information, process orders and assist with technical issues over the phone."
good,"Typically, 9-5 desk job. Easy work, relatively good pay. Can get a little repetitious but it paid the bills. Occasional overtime but no more than 5 hours or so."
good,"It was a good job I would diffently go back to work there,they only could pay a little more money to make the work a little more better. The calls were coming through back to back and was a little over bariing."
good,compensation with this company is everything. They pay very well. They only offer temporary positions at this time. why am I writing a review right now
good,"I feel like I needed more money per skill set , if yu would like to up train me? pay me  more money. They are not as flexible with the hrs as they claim.. The one I workd for had Bed bugs and they didn't do what they needed to do to get rid of them and or to keep the employee's safe from bringing them home. Should I say more?"
good,Is very much needed to help the elderly members that were involved with Medicare.  Was helpful to the people that needed it.  Overall a very fulfilling but terribly boring position.
good,"Xerox is a good company because they offer health, dental and vision. They also let you earn paid time off and bonuses not to mention the overtime. nice checks."
good,This company provides the standard requirements to work in a decent environment... Not much opportunity for advancement and the pay scale is about average at best...
good,i do not enter reviews for companies.  the part of the company i worked for was sold to my current employer therefor i will not enter a review for this company.
good,"A typical day at Xerox is filled with meetings, work and more meetings. We get to learn from multicultural multi country teams with a blend of on-site and off-shore team members. We have flexibility hours where meeting can also be attended remotely. Hardest part is communication in different time zones that increases delivery time to internal/external customers."
good,"* The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with members and being there for support.  And most of all, being able to find solutions to their issues."
good,"I sort Medical claims, and everyday is an opportunity to learn something new.  Management does not manage very well because the culture does not obey rules, and are allowed to get away with breaking the rules.  The hardest job is making money when your hands are hurting because sorting with your hands is how you make money.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the nice people you meet."
good,"The group of people I worked with were friendly and worked together to help each other out. I proofed information entered on credit card applications.  Processed and scanned air force paperwork into the system, proofed information for readability and saved to disk."
good,wasn't too bad only thing I ddi not like was requesting days off sucked. hard to get a scheduled you need based on your life managers sucked or were annoying
good,"my  review is a 3 over all "
good,Need More Hours And Better Pay. Want To Farther My Experience With Customer Service. It Is A Nice Place If You Are Looking To Grow. The Company Gives You Opportunities To Better Yourself...It's Easy For You To Move Up If You Stay Focus.
good,Last resort when it comes to this workplace . Although I was there nine years it's not somewhere I would return to. I was thankful for having a job. Work environment was not clean.
good,Not much accountability for mangers worm hours are great but training does not prepare you well enough for the actual jobs they need more hands on training
good,"Enjoyable, was having the job, good days or bad,  Processing toner,driving forklift loading trailers, production line shipping, receiving, inventory, all in 20 plus years. loved working 3rd shift.  Union shop."
good,"Great environment, staff and management were great. Great job for someone looking for a great company to work for. If helping people is in your nature you will really like the job"
good,"what are you looking for? it was a company, they paid me every two weeks. paid fairly. bonus opportunities. Lots of stress and uncertainty, felt like a meat grinder."
good,"Despite the sometimes ambiguous protocol and occasional lack of management solidarity, the job was all-in-all a good one.  I say this because it was the type of job which for the most part was dependent upon the individual employee's competence.  Not to say that I do not enjoy teamwork and cooperation in the workplace; I most definitely do.  However, in that particular environment cohesive cooperation was somewhat dysfunctional, and therefore most employees acclimated to depending more upon their individual self-sufficiencies.  Nonetheless, most of the employees were very friendly, and I found the position well-suited for anyone who is apt at customer service via telephone while managing customer assistance through the medium of computer software operation."
good,"Working at McDonalds I learned how to be very quick from bagging food, taking orders, and etc. McDonalds was a very good start for me, because it taught me so much about how to give good customer service."
good,"Working in HR Outsourcing allowed me to build a broad skill set from HRIS Operational support to Enterprise Implementations, covering all aspects from providing input to deal model for contract through implementation, operational support and decommissioning at end of contract."
good,"I was hired into the Caresource Health Insurance side of Xerox and quite honestly, no in the company has a clue about ANYTHING going on. No one can get their story straight. I was hired on as a ""Project-Based Employee"" at 12.50/hour. In my interview I was told that after six months, I could be considered for permanent employmen"
good,My job at Xerox was a customer service representative for sprint cellphones. I would handle everything from billing and connections to starting a new phone. Managment worked us like dogs and the customers could be super frustrating. Not an ideal job to have but the pay was pretty good.
good,Xerox is a job for those who are looking for a joba nd having a hard time finding one. It des teach some great skills for those planning on working in the call center environment but the work place it's self was full of drama and stress.
good,Great place to do meaningful work.   Xerox is a technology leader in office and production printing technology.  They just launched 29 new products this quarter.
good,It was OK the insurance with the company was good its cool to work there its just the supervisor are difficult to deal with they have no understand of people personal life
good,"Terrible management"
good,"Fun to work for, however, lack of job security. I enjoyed the challenge of troubleshooting cell phone issues and correcting the problem. The pay was not up to industry standards."
good,busy at times. can be fast moving pace at times especially when trying to meet deadlines for states and requirements needed to meet this deadline and goals
good,Typically you answer calls at work. I learned how to deal with high-strung Verizon customers. Management I had a very bad experience with.Work place culture is diverse.Hardest part of the job will be staying up during training. The most enjoyable part was the people i worked with.
good,This is a good job if your in between jobs and need something to hold you over. They don't give raises. And once your there u get stuck unable to find a better job because it's hard to request time off because their always understaffed from letting people go. Good luck
good,"Xerox was a very high paced and stressful place to work; however, it was also very entertaining and fun place of employment.  Single people could do really well at Xerox"
good,"Was all and all an alright job... sub-par training led to some awkward calls at first. But afterwards you start getting into a grove. The pay is decent, coworkers are decent, but the job and customers got old fast."
good,"Easy to get answers from experienced folks. Very productive but they stop a lot of projects due to finances. No cafeteria, poor air quality. stuffy offices due to security directives to keep doors closed"
good,The people there are very rude and disrespectful. The so called team leads were not helpful at all half of which did not ever know they were team leads. You were always expected to choose work over family!
good,"A good place who want to be a volunteer wrt the Technology and skills."
good,I enjoyed working here in the call center as I was able to actually help people. Medicare is hard to work with and understand for many and I was in a position to help these individuals obtain the care they needed and understand their costs and such.
good,Will have 8 hrs on work day and learn the most while on the job. Management will work with you whether it is personal or otherwise.The hardest part of job is not enough efficient training. The most enjoyable part of the job is helped customer solve a problem.
good,they were ok to work for but were very new when i worked for them. they were not very organized and the fluctuating hours were not the best. They could have gotten better with management
good,Xerox was my first call center job and I feel as though it prepared me for the customer service role. The culture was ok I believe the hardest part of the job was working 3pm-12am
good,"Interesting place to work.  A lot of good BI and IT work going on at They are a great group of people to work with, and are willing to support any ideas that will help their customers."
good,Inbound calls customers needing correct prescriptions mailed in a timely manner and service with a smile over the phone and provide accurate information regarding the customer needs to assure confidence with the company and product you are representing
good,"low pay, with no run for advancement. offers are promised but not delivered. Management does not back staff. It is a call center with low pay and no benefits."
good,"Learnt a lot. Very productive, Interactive with different people from different cultural background. Learnt how to work well and excel in a team environment. Managers are really very good, supportive."
good,"My team and supervisor were mutually supportive, communicative and committed to excellence in the Marketplace Insurance Specialist task. Upper management inconsistent procedures and metric expectation communication were problematic."
good,"A typical day at work is relaxed but focused. You will learn tolerance, patience, and empathy while employed here. The management style is through a chain of command. The workplace culture is team oriented. Hardest part of the job is the customer but the most enjoyable part of the job is the customer. Its really what you make it."
good,"Xerox works as a sub-contractor for many big companies, ranging from Sam's Club to Cox Cable. They are very good at teaching you what you need to know for the job. The supervisors are also very good for the most part. There is always at least one bad apple, right? The problem is the pay is  low and the 2 locations I worked at where dirty. The work areas, the floors, the walls, desks, even the phones, were nasty. The people where friendly. I guess Xerox is keeping their costs down in order to make a profit. Just trying to survive, like we all are."
good,"At Xerox, your break and lunch time are not known until you get your schedule.  You cannot go to the bathroom, eat your lunch, or even eat at your desk."
good,"Managements skills"
good,"There were many management changes in the one year that I worked there. Customer satisfaction was the goal but in lieu of that, the employees were neglected."
good,I enjoyed working for this company I learned a lot about the insurance industry. I enjoyed being an advocate for many people to assist in any way possible
good,"Overall good company,has changed alot over the years.Job security is not predictable anymore.Out sourcing more and more."
good,"Support system is good, colleagues are nice and are willing to help you integrate. Training is short but precise. Self-guided trainings are given from time to time to update you with the recent changes/updates."
good,"I enjoyed being able to help people gain the knowledge and information necessary, however a large majority of the time people do not like the information you give them which is part of the job. The supervisors gave different information to questions when you asked them so sometimes results in wrong information given. Overall, it was not consumers that really make the job three stars, it is the inconsistency and lack of caring on the supervisor team that made the job less enjoyable."
good,had  a terrific instructor very thoroughly trained  enjoyed  the job very versatile and enjoyable to help people hours were reasonable
good,Don't know that I've worked in the company that I can't always say the people are good to work with. That was true of Xerox also. But I will say that the expectations on you to do your job as a supervisor or manager on a salary and get it done in less than 50 hours was not attainable without not doing all tasks to 100%. So in the end because it was also salary plus commission at times you made less the those you're managed.
good,Me gusto la manera en que trabajan y la comunicacion que existe entre los empleados.
good,Working for this company was my first experience working in a call center. I took calls for Sprint ( retention ) . I do not prefer to work in the retention area but it will definitely help mold you on how to maintain call control.
good,"I enjoyed this job to a certain degree, they are nice people. I guess you want always have good days , but the pay is good and they give benefits. Only thing is they lay off so fast after your campaign is over."
good,Working at Xerox was  like any other typical day at work. We worked five days a week and had Saturday and Sunday off.  We took calls for  Independence BCBS of  Pennsylvania.
good,"Initiative to unite the sales and service personnel in efforts to bring a unified and seamless interaction with customers elevating the value proposition for the business relationship requirements, while improving internal communications between teams."
good,Travail enrichissant car je travaillai avec plusieurs service.
good,"A great management opportunity."
good,"Strong Interpersonal communication skills."
good,"Responsible to simulate an active Customer environment operating pre-launch Xerox equipment up to and beyond their rated capabilities to capture equipment performance and mean-time-to-failure rates"
good,"company is driven to excell in excellence, high standards are set. However management was a bit poor but had a clear idea of what needed to be done on a day to day basis."
good,It's only a data entry  process I worked for eight years in the company good atmosphere good environment in the company food coupons will be provided and only eight hours working six working  days in a week.
good,"If you can handle being mistreated by customers on a regular basis and not be able to do anything about it then this is the job for you. The workers are okay but the customers are more often then not, awful."
good,A great team with fun people to work with. No complaints about anything in the team. Parking is also paid for by the company. Christmas party was also great.
good,Not a bad place to work if you and interested in customer service and learning about the call center industry. The company does micro manage its employees
good,"This job was okay, benefits and pay was good, but being on the phone all day long non stop is really inconvenient. They have a really strict phone policy and a really strict attendance policy. People are great and management is great."
good,Une très bonne équipe : du pré-presse jusqu'aux imprimeurs.
good,"There has to be some sort of balance between work and personal life. In general, having that sense of balance will improve job satisfaction among employees because they will feel that they’re not overlooking the other areas of their lives that are, if not more, important to them than work."
good,"I was working on the Medicaid account actually, nothing to do with the typical idea of Xerox. We were the call center for all providers with questions on clients coverages and claims processing."
good,"It is an okay company can get a little stress but overall its not to bad i am a temp once u become permanent your pay goes lower...............,...,,,"
good,"Good starter job"
good,"I interned at Xerox as a Mechanical Engineer.  The experience was fun and i learned a lot.  Engineers are talented and had a good work-life balance.  however, the company moral appeared to be low."
good,"Working at this company the best part is the room for advancement. If you put in the work you can definitely move around in the company. However, until you reach manager level the pay is not very much. I will say that I have enjoyed the company changing over from Xerox to Conduent."
good,All in all working for Xerox was not bad. If you can handle getting yelled at by irate customers then this job will be ok for you. It just depends on which project you are on. I think Management needs more training.
good,"The company has great moral and great management, the company does not like to give raises and in my opinion did not care enough for their employees quality of life."
good,Ok with the salary and fun workplace. I rendered an extended time to review reject audits but without pay. Managers and supervisors were easy to get along with.
good,"Managed project team of Size 12 members ,assigning the task, Developing Project plan, Requirement gathering, holding stand up meeting for the team. developing Project work status and reporting to the higher managemnet"
good,"Coworker's are nice... Job is fast paced... Typical work day is processing applications, Answering and Making Calls.."
good,A typical day at Xerox is answering inbound calls helping clients complete their health benefits for the next year or change if needed to. While multitasking between different screen to help client as much as possible
good,"My first call center job."
good,"The work is good once you learn what your doing and the experience you get on the calls with the not so happy customers. But it needs some improvement."
good,"Xerox provides third party customer service centers for several large corporations. Sometimes there are delays in regards to communicating important changes in a timely manner. There are also  policies in place that prevent the third party associates from providing assistance as effectively and efficiently as an associate trained by that particular company. However, Xerox provides opportunity to advance quickly and plenty of extra cash. It also houses a positively competitive environment amongst employees."
good,I enjoyed my time with Xerox. I was given the opportunity to advance in the company and the culture was welcoming and fair.
good,"It was great however, the training was 3 months long and the pay was too modest for the type of responsability and work ethic it required. Overall it was a good place to work at."
good,"Encore une entreprise dont la politique de recrutement est... inexistante. Une moyenne d'âge de 50 ans, des mobilités internes improbables et sans accompagnement... "
good,"Worked in the CALA (Canada/Latin America) department for AT&T in which my team was charged with resolving high dollar customer disputes for large companies such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot.  Mathematical accuracy was paramount, and often, sales representatives were tasked with complicated mathematical approaches to resolutions which would involve international exchange rates which were subject to perpetual change."
good,Great job if you like call center work and unlimited overtime at times. I was not interested in this line of work therefore it was not rewarding to me.
good,sit with a headset on all shift and deal with abusive customers-not getting the floor support you need to succeed.  You can sit on the line with an verbally abusive customer for 2 hours or longer-
good,The job itself isn't bad. You're helping customers over the phone with their accounts. My shift changed 5 times. You have to work at least one day on the weekend. The hardest part of the job was sounding pleasant & chipper. I wasn't mad or upset. I just have a deep voice that can sometimes be misinterpreted.
good,"Très bonne ambiance générale, tous les employés sont sympa."
good,a great place to have as a foundation to build a career moving forward and great to have on a resume. good company and great support from supervisors and managers
good,Xerox (or Conduent as it soon will be) is a work in progress. That is really all you can say about it at the moment. It is a work in progress. It is a lot better than it used to be.
good,This was a temporary project team Domtar put together to help during the Xerox transition.  Still the same company and same review as was stated earlier.
good,some of the employees and managers are very rude but overall its a nice place to work for money. The bathrooms are disgusting because employees do not follow the rules
good,"I've learned how to give excellent customer service. Colleagues on my team were helpful, management not so helpful. We learned how to stick together as a team to complete a task without management."
good,"I loved speaking with the various different people every day and the ability to help them. I loved the fast paced environment and co workers.  The hardest part was the mental fatigue of 4, 12 hour days.   Lol"
good,"Assisting customers with their technical support issues"
good,"I enjoyed the people that I work with; everyone was helpful; I am a very hard worker and learned a lot; I handled many multiple tasks without much training because my coworker was off on vacation in the beginning of my training. I was supposed to have weekly training with another coworker but that coworker always ""canceled"" our training session so I learned a lot of ""hands on"" experience by myself. I was able to keep up and remained very organized during multiple tasks."
good,"What enjoyed most was the flexibility in you schedule.  I was afforded the opportunity to work from home 2 days a week (Monday & Friday's, selected by the Director)."
good,I would go in call center be sure all updates needed were posted and received calls to assist with Humana.  It was a different job culture for me I do not prefer working in call center environment.
good,Generally okay. Most management is mostly proficient and the coworkers are great but not a ton of room for growth and favoritism is obvious.
good,Good place to build up skills. Learn to work under pressure. Was able to learn how to build a relationship with customers. Co workers are friendly. Hardest part of the job is getting the help you needed to succeed as an employee.
good,"productive work place. needs improvements , advantage work day , some drama"
good,"I know many people who love this job, I am not one of them. I had issues with sitting in front of screen and have had to look into and take of these issues. Other than that, It is just not the job for me."
good,"Workplace is okay, big call center need better supervisors and more products knowledge. Operation hours are good and very flexible. overall had very good experience"
good,The job was OK. It could have been a lot better. I felt like it wasn't professional enough for me. I felt like they show favoritism. The job wasn't put together enough for me. It was not organized at all. Didn't have enough materials for workers.
good,"In mijn ervaring bij Xerox project Telfort heb ik op verschillende afdelingen mijzelf mogen uitdagen en leren. "
good,"To get anything of real value done at Xerox, it requires a lot of signatures and input from many who have no clue what it is you're doing anyway. This makes management positions within the company difficult."
good,"Been a long time since I worked there, but the company was fine at the time.  My division was closed, so no idea on other divisions still ongoing.  Room for advancement."
good,"Accountant is responsible for daily, weekly and monthly processes.  From downloading daily bank reports, weekly account reconciliations and month end process."
good,I don't like the environment at current place. I want to increase my level and also I would like to work at best management place which is who can polish me by their experience and skills.
good,"Great work atmosphere, not the easiest job but at times could be the most rewarding. I'm looking forward to coming back again some day when I know my heart is in it."
good,this was a horrible place to be. you had to be a kisser to the bosses and be one of their favorite people. what else is there to say
good,"Good but so-so pay. Beautiful pantry and good benefits. Co-workers are good, for the recruitment team they hire fast and the management are also good."
good,great work enviroment very calm working place to work at many call centers in one building productive working place with people you get very close with each other
good,I was able to get as many hours as I wanted and needed. The turnover may be high but if you are consistent and want to work you are able to. Comes with benefits if needed and is good all around for someone with open availability and wants hours.
good,Good atmosphere at work. I liked the people  I worked with. I liked my supervisor and Manager. I have worked with the same people for many years and got along with them. The hardest part of the job was being laid off after 30+ years. Coming to work and seeing my friends at work was the most enjoyable time at Xerox.
good,This job was so long ago that I do not think that any comments I make will be relevant to anyone considering working for them.  I am only doing this because it is a requirement from this website.
good,Great workplace and schedule. i like how it was a points system and how they were when i was working there. my co workers were great to work with some management was great while others were a little rude a disrespectful.
good,"Every morning we will do quality control on all bank levies. Once it hit 10 am, we will then start our deposits for all the banks. we send our checks electronically as an image cash letter to nine banks. when this is completed, we will then work on all reject checks and return it back to remitter. At the end of each day we will reconcile and balance into an excel spread sheet."
good,Horrible. No team effort every man for themselves. No decent training. pay was good no benefits. No room for growth in the company.
good,"I didn't mind the job, only the customers that expected me to remember their names and their previous orders on a daily basis. I don't believe the pay was worth the headache."
good,Too many layoffs which caused me to loose many very good people. I resigned and left on good terms. I wanted to work as a data analyst.
good,"I am trying to learn more to earn more. I want to get Cisco Certified. I am trying to get Company to help pay, no help so far. a big company but sometimes too big."
good,I loved the people I worked with. My trainer was very good in training us to be prepared for what we would be doing in our positions as clinical pharmacists.
good,"- Taking inbound and outbound calls and emails from Finland and UK lines. "
good,"Working at Xerox was fun, it felt like home majority of the time you were able to be yourself as long as you were also helping the customers in a professional manner."
good,The people are great and it is a real family environment.  Management is very kind but can be a little detached from their employees.
good,"Typical work day consists of fulfilling childrens needs. Diaper changes, learning  activities, feedings, as well as outside play."
good,"Good hourly pay. Easy work when you get a hang of it. Supervisor was compassionate and down to earth. Long hours, bi-weekly pay, competitive for desired hours."
good,This is one of the BPO industry the gives a high salary for an agent. With good benefits and compliance with the needs of employees.
good,"Hands down data entry. Chat with coworkers here and there since pay is based on production, everyone keep to themselves and try to meet quota."
good,Due to a transition in the company structure it would not be appropriate to offer any sort of an accurate review. The current working environment is not the same as when I was employed.
good,Could be a little more organized and higher pay as licensed agents also full time hours are not offered in between start date and product training
good,"met a lot of nice helpful fellow employees along the way. Had to dead with many ego's (management, lack of support) along the way. They took too long to resolve this problem. Lost a lot of good people. Very competent person in place now."
good,boost mobile custmer service expert. Duties included  answering inbound customer resolve the issue with excellent customer service.
good,"The most enjoyable are the Exceptional People "
good,"Pleasant working atmosphere, smaller contracted location within United Technologies Corporation.  Payroll Tax analysis, processing and customer service."
good,"Work is always challenging and enjoyable. Working Sprint project with Xerox. It is a fast pace environment and is very rewarding with Customer issues are resolved and customer are feeling happy, satisfied and valued."
good,"I feel that it is a nice place to work, my only complaint is when they make changes they do not give you a decent amount of time to adjust your life to that new change. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is of course dealing with angry customers, but just starting out there is plenty of support to help you deal with that."
good,"The environment at Xerox was friendly, however it lacked some support from management and the supervisors. The company talked about growth in the company, but the process required for moving up was unclear. Management seemed to only care about their employees when the employees were considering quitting their job or there was high call volume. Management offered very little incentives for working overtime. There was a huge elevated increase in the number of incoming calls which provided no time for coaching between the employee and their supervisors in order to improve the employees job performance.The supervisors were helpful at answering questions, but the supervisors cared more about handle time than helping the customer with their issues. Shift bids were nice, but the company failed to relay what was needed in order to move higher up on the list for signing up for an employee's desired shift; this made it difficult to know what areas of the job the employee needed to improve in order to be at a higher rank in the company. Nesting was also an issue because most employees only had a coupe days to a week on the floor after their training was complete; in training, the employees only had one or two days to answer phones and get a feel for the job. The benefits were probably the best part of the job."
good,awesome co-workers . learned a lot .The hardest part of the job is the background process . Management is good. pay is decent. no growth opportunities. pay rate and benefits is not that great.
good,Laid off from first position. Current positions doesn't have guaranteed hours or pay. Cannot transfer until employed for six months. The job is easy but the pay and hours are uncertain.
good,Good and stable company that offers great opportunity. A lot of challenges to face that make the employee excel and improve more.  Management is fair and so with co-workers.
good,While working here we take inbound only calls. Things are always changing such as rules or how the system works and you aren't aware when this changes happen until they are done. when you need help with something it could take awhile before you can find someone to help you. The people that are suppose to be avail to help would be floor support or sups. most of the time you feel  like youre bugging someone when you need assistance and they make it seem like its something that's not part of their job title.
good,"Arrive, open emails review allocated escalations and chase as necessary. Review new escalations, mark as accepted and then process. If systems are not set up to the correct level to enable any investigations to be carried out then install OS and  any necessary applications then import customers data. Test and review findings if appropriate identify any workarounds to allow customer to complete their jobs and escalate to the development team for incorporation into any future software releases. Hardest and most frustrating part of the job was managing the escalations.  Most enjoyable part was investigating the issues, supplying a workaround and getting the thanks from the customer at the end of the day. Team I worked with were very professional and easy to get on with..."
good,"a typical  day at work was from monday thru friday from 9 to 5 "
good,"I loved my Service delivery job and how I was able to work directly with my customers to meet their needs.  Xerox has decided to split the company from the core business and IT hosting, which has meant many people losing their jobs."
good,There is a productive work environment. A customer care representative is responsible for customer satisfaction. Xerox provides the tools for customer interaction. Also the tools needed to fix customer issues.
good,Xerox was a very good company to work for with a lot of opportunity for advancement.  I loved working in the field with no supervision but being trusted that the job would be done.  My co-workers were great and very supportive.
good,"Gained a lot of knowledge while working here, the trainer was great at teaching and being helpful. The down side is the schedule that is given to all the new employees. You won't get the schedule you want unless your in a higher position or have been there longer."
good,This was a great experience because i was helping elderly people with getting their prescriptions filled and making sure they had enough to last. I thought about myself and when i become older i'm going to want someone to  be there for me also
good,The work enviroment is like none I have ever been in. The variety of employee is what makes this place so comfortable. Everyone brings in their own world to share with one another when time is given beteen job duties. You are given freedom to bring personal belongings and entertainment that is work approved to your work space to help kill extra time and provide comfort when dealing with high stress information. My main probelm with this establishment was the way the managment ran. They introduced a new scheduling system that people were given no choice but to participate in that cause many a lose to the company. All the while any managment you would ask about it would strictly deny it and completely shut you down. The relationship between employee and managment was extremely low with little to no trust. Another positive was the employee appreciation activities. There was often food or dress-up contests which brought a sort of excitment to fellow co-workers. We all relied on eachother to get through every day and that is what made me stay here so long. I enjoyed the experience and it has made me 100 times better at customer service in the long run which I believe is extremely important in life.
good,"The benefits were wonderful and the staff was friendly and fun to work with. The work could be monotonous and mentally draining, but the salary was nice. This was a great opportunity for gaining customer service experience."
good,"quite formally with the supervisor relationship, the company, kind eros, charismatic, was satisfied with the work, which if not tolerated was the little tolenrancia by the head of the group, outside that context working in peace, armonia, and everyone knew the obligations they had."
good,A typical day at work for me is getting everything done that  i possibly can until it is time to clock out. I am very focused when tasked are provided to me and get them done in a timely manner. Being able to have fun on the job is all in how you manager your time while getting work done. It is up to the employee how to make there job fun.
good,"Pays the bills. It paid the bills, but it only paid the bills if you catch my drift. While paying bills, it didn't not pay bills. It didn't not not not leave bills unpaid. Make sense?"
good,I was a flow through consultant and didn't have many direct dealings with Xerox Global Services. I had interaction with a local team of fulltime employees. Their feedback of the company was positive
good,"aggressive environment, management is so helpful and and accessible, a lot to learn, very fast past, so many opportunities for growth"
good,"I am grateful that Xerox gave me the opportunity to gain the experience and certification on customer service, technical solutions. However receiving information that other personnel within the same department that I fell under were receiving a high pay, was unjustifiable. The position was challenging on a daily basis, dealing with angry customers and trying to help them the best way possible in order to satisfy their need, I felt as though we should get a fair pay."
good,"Xerox is an employee friendly organisation, provides sufficient opportunities for learning and also flexible work culture."
good,"I am a remote employee, which I absolutely love. I occasionally miss the office setting but that is few and far between. I enjoy the lack of distraction working from home. Management keeps in touch and gives daily updates on work that needs to be completed."
good,"I worked 6 years at Xerox and enjoyed it.  It is a printing company."
good,"it was a ok entry level job, lot of employess, clean place and room for advancement....different companies to apply with"
good,Atypical Call Center environment. Work stations clean and always available. Supervisors very engaging and helpful on a regular basis. Contests and rewards always scheduled.
good,"It is a great place to work in, employees are very cheerful. The work is interesting and always a place to learn new things."
good,"Although the work was tough, I could always count on fellow employees for help and support when I struggled. Management always tried to provide the help and knowledge we needed. It was a relaxed environment with a lot of help from everyone around me."
good,"My experience entails being notified on a Friday before a three day weekend that my position was being eliminated. And while this was to be expected, it seems this communication could have waited until the following Tuesday. Obviously the most senior management at Xerox has no compassion for people."
good,"Computer programs used are extremely outdated!!!"
good,Enjoyed working with the people there.  Hardest part of the job is waiting for when you will be offshored. Company seems to be lagging behind in latest technology.
good,"it is good with working with xerox and now i am looking new ways."
good,A typical day at work is answering the phone assist customers with any issue that they have. I learned a lot about the different prescriptions plans and insurance that would covered certain types of medications. The management was okay sometimes the managers themselves did not know what to do with questions that me and some of my co-workers did not understand.The co-workers I meet were actually great it was a lot laughs and entertainment while on the production floor. The hardest part of my job was how high the call volume is during APE and Welcome Season. I could not imagine taking over 100 some calls in one day. That a headache for anybody. Overall the job is okay if your a very patient person and willing to spend hours to assist a customer this jobs might be great for you.
good,Overall good environment. Good management. I had a good experience during my time working there. Only bad part was the customers I had to talk to.
good,Training program needs an overhaul. More hands on training would be better than learning out of a power point presentation. Wave of negativity hits you as soon as you open the door.
good,"I felt that the training could have been more developed. Promised 40 hour work week plus possible overtime. Eventually, went to a 25-30 hour work week unless new version of iOS was being introduced."
good,"Good company. Its base is fixed on ethics."
good,"This job is one of the most versatile jobs I have ever started, although it requires a lot of information, it really challenges me, which I love."
good,"Helped expand business for Xerox in the DC metro area by working cross functionally with service, sales, and Fortune 500 clients across multiple territories and verticals. Corporate training was very good."
good,Good place to work. Great work experience for data processing. Also nice place to learn Customer Service qualities. Company built on team work.
good,"Typical 8-5 work day. Clean environment, friendly people. Updated training facilities with state of the art technology."
good,"sometimes good and sometimes bad.. need a change..mandatory time on filing .. long hrs , pushed to do more. Work on production log,, everything must be logged in to get paid.. pay often up and down..."
good,Good place to work.  Not too freedom at times to make decisions.  Micro-managed to make desired outcomes materialize.  Very hard to advance.
good,Daily status meeting and status updates and daily new learning about system and following management policy and work as team work.
good,"Empresa de manufatura, com processos bem particulares em relação ao mercado em geral. Trabalha com tecnologia e equipamentos de ponta. Muito dinâmico o ambiente de trabalho, equipe enxuta, processo robusto."
good,"Es  algo novedoso ,aprendi  a perder la timides , acumplir con mis objetivos."
good,Gave me my foundation in sales. I would totally work there again -- if I was going to get back into sales. Buyer forces sales techniques.
good,"A typical day at work would be to reapply payments, deferments, forbearances, etc to student loans.. I learned to recalculate the terms of a student loan retroactively for several years. to reply the terms of various deferments and forbearances within that period that a payment may not have covered. "
good,The top executives aren't making the right decisions. The idea that cutting the workforce down in order boost the stock price is not working and has not been working for years. Buying back company stock sends the wrong message to investors.
good,Not able to move up to desired positions as they will choose favorites.  If management was better the pay would go up as you do a lot of work there and are not paid for it.
good,"I would help customers in person and on the phone.  As the only girl in the office, I did all the typing filing, A/R, A/P, invoicing, payroll and collections"
good,"This was a good job however they do hold you to high standards. The hours were not bad but they were very early for me. I did learn about apple products , and the management was very nice and willing to help you"
good,"Xerox was a great company to work for.  Fantastic technology, but as an organization they were too slow to change.  Multiple reorgs and changes are slowly working."
good,"Usually on the phone all day speaking to clients who need their medications approved."
good,"Hardest part of the job was the back to back calls, but metrics were always on top, no matter what. Supervisors were very supportive and comprehensive."
good,This company allowed me to get my feet wet and get a brighter outlook on the customer service realm. I enhanced my listening and troubleshooting skills to another level.
good,"I learned a lot working at this company, about how to deal with different people and how to cope with their wants, needs, and their emotions, also learning how the equipment works, a lot of problem solving was used in this job."
good,Fast paced.  Busy workplace.  Your worked overtime. One on one training. Company is growing.  Good opportunity for employees to advance.  Work was contracted through the state of Maryland.
good,"Not a very dynamic or fast moving place to be... but the same can be said for many old, big companies. The resources to pursue more interesting opportunities are available but management is far too old-fashioned and risk averse. Everyone's nice though."
good,"It's a good job to help you pay bills, however you don't really work directly for the company you take calls for so it does put you at a disadvantage."
good,This was a call center job. There was a lot to learn and keep up with. there was a lot of pressure to close calls and move on. Have to keep your numbers up.
good,A typical day at work is being taking inbound and outbound calls for half of the day and the other half I'm on escalation calls and floor support as a teram lead.
good,"this was a contract job so I really don't have too much to say about this company...The staff could have been a little bit more friendly, but other then that everything was alright."
good,"A typical day at work consists of assisting Medicare Part D members with their benefits. The joyous part of this is that I have been able to truly use my interpersonal and intrapersonal skills in being generationally literate of the population of the consumer. Through this I have learned to handle various, initiated situations to push for positive client interaction and timely outcomes. In addition, I have been able to work onmy deesclation skills. Management seems a little dismissive, if at all present, the higher the level but immediate supervisors are resourceful.  Coworkers seem a little stressed, always looking for another job but grateful for the current employment. The hardest part of the job is when you have exhausted all the resources you have and there is still no resolution for such vulnerable citizens of out society, the elderly and disabled.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when you can resolve their issues or when they share stories of their life journies!"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting providers, which allowed me to exemplify superior customer service. Unfortunately, the management lacked professionalism."
good,"Pros"
good,"Fair Pay, but highly prejudice for Austin locals."
good,"Overall a good place to start a career, but would be difficult to stay there long term..... young working professionals with no established work habits or career aspirations.....still a good starting place to start a career."
good,Its more for college students looking for work while in school. Money can be made as long as you don't get involved befriending staff.
good,My experience at TMSHealth has taught me tp be persistent in your work and continue to strive for more. The atmosphere is ever changing so you need to be flexible.
good,A great place to receive call center experience. A pleasant workplace environment. Multiple programs to process thru. The supervisors are eager to help promote you.
good,This company unfortunately primarily hires contract workers who often remain on contract for at least 1-2 years before getting full time. It's unfortunate because seems like a great company to be a part of.
good,"My typical day began pulling up systems and ready to accept calls at designated start time."
good,"hi "
good,"Answered inbound callsUpdated client information in the databaseTook applications for medical assistanceTook renewal application for medical assistanceAnswered general question about medical assistanceResearched and provided information to clients"
good,Same review as the one previous for Xerox people are great my team was great. Won many awards and was recognized frequently for the work we did.
good,"The caliber of the employees they would hire have no previous employment history or no prior customer service experience. Not knowing how to engage a conversation with the customers over the phone, or interacting with other employees starting altercations at the workplace"
good,"Working for Xerox is quite an experience.   There was a 9 week training in a classroom setting and then another couple weeks on the floor with the help of assistants.  "
good,very odd group of people not a very good job i watch 50 people get fired less than a week after they were hired unrealistic goals lied to about pay and benefits there was no structure
good,"When started with the company, there were undergoing complete transformation, was bit lost due unclear role and responsibilty"
good,A typical day at work includes lot's of customer interface lot's of machine maintenance/repair and upgrades.my co-workers were there to back you up in times of need. Management always trying to improver the work output.
good,"the pay is low, the benefit is low and the job ended less than 8 months and i am happy i am no longer there.  But it is a good thing also that i learned to do medical record scanning which is demanding in the medical record job."
good,"Xerox has different campaigns that you can work some of them pay more than others , however my favorite working for this company was apple, I enjoyed troubleshooting apple products also gave me a lot of knowledge, I actually worked there a couple months in Raleigh nc and transferred back to charlotte for a different campaign"
good,"this job was an experience that I would not ever want to endure ever again. There is no room for growth, the supervisor showed favoritism, There's no organization and I felt the company really didn't care for their employees."
good,The pay was nice but it didnt seem like there was much room for growth. I just couldnt handle being in the cubicle. If you need a job asap and you can handle being a call center. This is the place for you.
good,"The department Im in is for verizon wireless "
good,"I love helping people and being a part of a team, the downfall of this job would be customers calling in just to yell at you. Other than that, this company really cares for their employees."
good,"on a typical day you would arrive at work and work on insurance claims. my coworkers weren't bad people. in fact, i rather enjoyed their company. however, management had left much to be desired they would take an exceeding amount of breaks, but would lash out upon the staff if something occurred that made you a little late upon returning from your break. they would constantly use their phone on the work floor, which is strictly against the company policy, since we dealt with a lot of client information(addresses, phone numbers, etc.) the job itself wasn't bad at all, it was the management which made the job rather difficult, due to their rather unorthodox ways."
good,"Never know what's going to happen."
good,It was very interesting. I got a chance to learn a new and different craft that propelled me to have more options for myself moving forward.
good,"I learned a lot about account payables.  My day was typically data entry.  My Supervisor/Manager was a great person to work for.  I made a lot of great friends.  I enjoyed my job, it was just time to move on."
good,"Provided us with food and daily free transportation to home and to office."
good,"Working for this company kinda sucks they demand mandatory overtime, will 30 mins lunch  breaks. the pay is great. however they are so quick to fire people."
good,"Assisted various members on the telephone with their medications."
good,I just started training back in October and so far it has been good. I will be able to give a more definitive answer when I start working on the call floor.
good,"Xerox is challenging, especially if you think outside of the box and want to actually drive new business. Mired in process and very slow to react, upper management is in a coma"
good,Great income. The most difficult thing about this job is the angry callers You are trained how to handle these calls but you never know what could be said from an angry caller.
good,Steady flow of work. Gain good experince in goverment health care. Good hours. No overnight work. Friendly co workers. Two diffrent locations.
good,A good company as a stepping stone job. some of the practices used within the company could be more efficient. assisting multiple clients and a helpdesk environment with a variety of software.
good,"The people that I worked with at this job were very personable. The management was as well. The pay was fine, but the scheduling was not."
good,I was working in this company for some time but it did not work out like I wanted. Good for new and young people to works. Offers some progression inside the company.
good,"Overall its a good company to work for, lots of room for moving up in   with in the company.  You learn on how to work with people of different background and ethnicity."
good,It was truly an experience that will carry me through my journey in  the work force. I am grateful for the encounter. My fellow co-workers were a great team of people.
good,Decent job if you are hired full time and not as a project based employee. I cannot speak about the job fully since I am project based.
good,"Company needs to invest in workplace upgrade and modernization - chairs, headsets, operating software.  Company had planned but not yet realized these improvements when I left."
good,"full of drama, from the advisor to the supervisors to the Managers, everyone gossiped and talked down on one another. There was no type of support from team mates and superiors. Not everyone in the company was bad but a good majority of them were crooked. Don't get me wrong, if you keep to yourself like I did you would be fine but even some of us quiet ones got caught in the web of drama. The incentives are awesome though and they worked with your schedule for the most part."
good,I started as a comission based sales rep but I managed to establish the quotas on time.  Only thing I did not like is the pay.
good,Fun work place but have some issues in management. Slow career growth but still a good company indeed. it offers work life balance.
good,Xerox calling center isn't too of a job but some floor leads and management can be carless. However if you like sitting down all day and do not like being on your feet all day this is the job for you.
good,I loved going to work for xerox and would recommend anyone to work there. Learned how to manage people and deal with stressful situations. Also had the opportunity to learn about the medicare and medicaid process.
good,"Typically handle 50-100 calls a day. Mostly the same dozen things all day. Some interesting troubleshooting situations do come up. Lots of blind troubleshooting with very limited internet access (i.e. cannot even go to Microsoft or Google Android pages to get support) and limited access to physical devices or accurate simulations. Can fluctuate between 3 calls in queue per rep to 45 min in between calls. Smaller teams and lighter workload then tier 1 means more collaboration with coworkers on troubleshooting issues."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of answering phone calls and emails from various PA county child support offices.  There are 67 county child support offices that are permitted to call with questions  or request assistance in the program that tracks all of the child support case information for families.  "
good,"Xerox was a very interesting place to work in. In my department we worked mostly with cellphone service, providing our customer with personalized correction, repair and coverage service. "
good,"It was always so busy because we were constantly short staffed, hardest part of the job was the customers by far which is understandable because if they are paying for phone service they should be able to use said service without any interruptions. The work building itself was a mess, and the equipment they supplied us was awful. If you had a midshift you would have trouble trying to find a place to sit because the computer or the phone wouldnt work."
good,decline.  I do not see how this is relevant to obtaining employment else where.  I decline this step in the process. Decline.
good,"overall review of a day on the job was assisting Verizon customers as best as I can with billing questions, troubleshooting there devices, and or applying a credit to a bill or to the whole account."
good,I was exposed to excellent training and growth at Xerox. Would recommend this as a good place to work with accommodating shifts.
good,The company could improve how flexible are with schedules and work/life balance. The company must remember the most importan resource is human resources.
good,With xerox I have been very flexible with my schedule as well as be up trained without the opportunity to have an increase in pay. I have given up schedules that were promised to me by their miscommunication and had to sacrifice re enrolling in school and other employment.
good,If you're in the least bit professional you will earn promotions quickly due to the general population that lives in the area.
good,Dynamic company to work with. Excellent training skills were given at all times. Friendly management always took care of any company situations.
good,"Productive and fun workplace, customer service, coordinates, supervises prior authorization, research, resolve benefits, technical and team production, time management, planning, account management, inbound, outbound calls, and business support."
good,"My job was in a section of the company that was contracted to provide customer service for an out of state cable provider. Much of our time was spent apologizing for other employees of the main company who did not do their jobs properly. Most of the customers we engaged were nice people, with the usual bunch that could not be satisfied no matter what was done. Too much attention was spent trying to sell services in my opinion instead of focusing on helping the customer. I did, however, learn much about how to detach myself emotionally from the caller. I found this skill to be extremely useful."
good,It used to be a fun work environment until management changed.  After that it seemed like they didn't care about the reps needs.  It turned into a work all day mandatory overtime regardless of your out of work schedule
good,Spends a huge amount of resources on very simple tasks.  Does not let employees contribute views and ideas.  Never see management other than direct supervisor.
good,Lack of management. TMS just acquired inVentiv health iPas so I'll have to get back to this later with further information.
good,The people were always friendly. Updating assessments. Loved my co-workers. Reviewed training materials. Trained pre-existing and new hire employees. Training dep and management work closely together.
good,productive workplace fast paced environment and room to move throughout the company.  Great start for anyone being introduced into a call center environment.
good,"Receiving incoming phone calls from members of the company to have prescriptions delivered to their homes, great managers, hardest part of the job is holding your bladder while assisting angry callers, the best part about my job was satisfying my callers"
good,"Xerox was a very analytical workplace rather then a fun workplace. At Xerox you were required to work via a concept of the Organization rather then actually spend a great deal of time selling the product. "
good,A by the book place to work. Staff friendly but focused mainly on their work. Usual amount of red tape and politics which is expected at a large company.
good,"It's a call center. The schedules are ok as well as the work environment. I dispatch services for customers, as well as troubleshoot their issues with vehicle."
good,"Good work life balance, supportive management, productive team."
good,I sold SMART Technologies to school districts around the state.  They pay was not equal to the work that was required and neither were the bonuses.
good,Typical big company politics and red tape. Overall enjoyed the people I worked with. Challenging projects from time to time outside of the day in and out tasks. Productivity focused but still allowed for the opportunity to grow and develop where possible.
good,Good place to work and progress in your career. Established policies and procedures to follow. Have a great team on board.
good,Had a fast pace environment. Co-workers were friendly. Some of the hardest parts of the job were having difficult situations that we were not able to have control over in order to fix. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to people and having experience in multiple different situations.
good,I enjoyed working with the latest technology and training others on our newest systems. The sales training at Xerox was excellent and looked forward to taking classes to learn more for on the field competitive market.
good,Easy recruiting process...great people to work with...decent pay....average work environment...chances for advancement....
good,"Too many chiefs, not enough indians. the work was easy, but the training  not sufficient."
good,In this job I learn how to work with the PO's of governments accounts and establish a good business relationship with the customers.
good,"I can see there should me more strategies needed to grow in India and Management is in very bad shape no control over the process."
good,"People are great, environment is laid back and management is willing to help when needed. Training is somewhat disorganized, some supervisors are difficult to work with."
good,Well this was a good place to work for me where I was able to learn and use my knowledge at the service of the company. I was working with a team of IT professionals that helped me develop some other skills that I needed and I think I helped them too as we worked as a team.
good,Los colegas son respetuosos .. El ambiente laboral es muy comodo no es trabajo muy pesado  lo que aprendi en xerox fue como trabajar con clientes y analizar sus situaciones
good,"Provides good internal learning paths.  A very large company, so there is a lot of red tape to get things done.  People are good to work with, but feel they are tied down by the red tape."
good,This job was high strung position where you had to answer calls from patients about their co-payments and anything else due to their medical coverage about the drugs or  why a they had such a high payment for their prescription.
good,"it was an okay place to work not what i expected from a call center. it was a mellow place some co-workers were fun to be around and others not so much. pay was not that great, it was not what they said it would be so that was a big down side."
good,"Constant convoluted corporate processes to deal with, below market pay with no raise in two years while running a financially successful program. No room for advancement or promotion. Currently working on a contract that is soon to run up, because of Xerox' actions in other sectors with the same client, they may have already taken themselves out of the running. Profit is #1. "
good,"I took the job because they said they were willing to work with my school schedule to become a pharmacy technician. Once the work schedules came out, they put me in a schedule where it clashed with my class time. When I approached them and told them that they said that they would work with me and my schedule, they said that the schedule received is what I had to work or I would have to leave the company."
good,i enjoyed having a flexible schedule and the work environment. also loved the food. room to raise in the company and grow. and learn. and praise.
good,Learning experience was truly invaluable. Challenging to adhere to a call performance everyday. Management changed too often the requirements. Coworkers were friendly and family oriented. Hardest part of the job was the amount of time restricted to one area. The enjoyable was the commute and the learning experience.
good,"my typical day involves answering questions and going over customers bills, the hardest part is figuring out what is the actual problem at times."
good,"My time at Xerox was interesting and Fun."
good,One of the things that I miss is my co-workers. I learn a lot. In a nice location. Good hours. Nice salary. Nice working with health care.
good,"Lots of number crunching, due to older contractual language and many amendments sometimes made it difficult to follow contractual charges, so it made it  hard to reconcile actual customer billing and contractual charges.  Sales department created the amendments and changes did not get communicated to billers this made internal audits difficult for the biller."
good,"If you can rock sales, while ensuring you actually get credit for them and deal with absolutely no support from management or fellow employees straight out of your 2 months of spotty training, then this is the place for you"
good,each day is different as well as an experience! it was a great way to learn a new job managment could have been better but overall ok
good,"Xerox is ok. Customer support, can't let the customers determine your attitude it affects other calls. A lot of opportunities if you work hard!"
good,"All I can say is if you enjoy working in retail, it's a great place to work."
good,A typical day includes working on Compendia system working from the diary of daily tasks. I mainly deal with death cases and general pension enquiries.  My role also involves answering member queries by telephone.  MS Word and Excel used on a daily basis.  The current environment is extremely busy as we have taken on new schemes and have no additional staff but most pull together to work hard to get it done and offer a good service.  The hardest part of my job is getting involved with complicated calculations but I love learning.  I enjoy the people I work with and the interaction with the members and I like to be busy and challenged.
good,"Answering quetions in regards to health insurance plan only as far as billing"
good,"I worked at Xerox for 25 years. I had many jobs and met so many wonderful people. There were many changes within those 25 years, and many were not pleasant but overall it was a good company to work for."
good,"Enjoying working with coworkers.  Like the flexibility and good benefits."
good,"-I had a very productive I spent all day every day at work trying to make sure the customers were satisfied. "
good,"A typical work day consists of 5-8 calls per hour. Some times computer errors occur or updates needed and that prevents you from doing work properly.  During my time at Xerox I learned a great deal about telecommunications. I also advanced my knowledge of computers. M supervisor and his supervisor, as well many co-workers, were all on good terms."
good,The job is helpful for experience. You learn how to assist clients with government assistance programs. Decent job overall.
good,Co-workers were great to be around. Wish the employee morale would've been better. Earning potential was also very low.
good,Great company work environment is ok could be better not much assistance from management compensation is bare minimum
good,I worked in several different areas in the 23 years i worked there. I did a good job working with the people and getting the work done.
good,"Fast paced working environemnt. Great company to work for, I would recommend if you enjoy helping people. Opportunities for advancement as long as all standards are maintained and goals are met."
good,"working at xerox was rewarding. they introduced me to some good people, who are now good friends. i learned valuable skills that will help me in future jobs to come."

good,Opérations de saisie diverses en lien avec les assurances. Equipe majoritairement féminine et bonne entente au sein de l'entreprise
good,"this is no problem with this job. Hardest part is getting to work on time because of parking. this job was no problem. Coo-workers are no problem, i stay to myself."
good,The company is trying to gain more work place satisfaction by improving the facilities and providing more incentives.
good,"se llega temprano y se realizan las primeras actividades que son la inspección de cajas la cual no debe tener ningún daño en caso de contar con algún daño reportarlo al personal encargado posteriormente se inicia la carga de producto terminado mismo que se va anotando en reportes debidamente aprobados al termino de la carga se solicitan los sellos y se colocan tomando fotografías posteriormente se reporta vía electrónica a personal de mexico, d.f. y e.u.a. para su conocimiento"
good,I get a chance to use my skills. Good place to learn about different and new technologies. Great place to meet and work with people.
good,"For recent school graduates, It is an ok place to start with. Management is not awesome and you will have to plan the rest of your life activities base on your continuous changing schedule"
good,Xerox is a good company that has taught me a lot over the last 8 years. I learned OTI and Billing roles and have excelled in both positions. I'm looking for a new start now.
good,"um dia típico : meu primeiro dia de trabalho pois foi meu primeiro emprego."
good,"This company is good because they're always hiring and they hire everyone, no matter the country you're from or language(s) you speak. But they're always hiring because people are quitting and people are being fired due to their excessively high and intolerable standards of work performance. This job is extremely stressful for people who care and actually want to help and make a difference, what you see on the work floor differs immensely from what they teach you. Most of the workers and higher ups are extremely kind and friendly, even to the customers, but most of them also tend to ignore the customers, put the on hold and just sit there to relax, hang up on the customers, transfer them without listening to them and then the customer leaves the company due to terrible customer service, if this company practiced what they taught, they wouldn't have to deal with bells of churn."
good,"Good entry level position and quick employment; however, fast turn around due to management.  Management could care less about employees and their needs.  Only appears to care about the client needs."
good,This job changed management and when downhill. The hours got longer and pay didn't change.  Trying to do a lot with a little just didn't work.
good,The job is mostly cold calling on dr's and pharmacy's but you do learn to communicate difficult messages and get an inside view of the healthcare industry.
good,There was steady work pace as well as several training courses through out me being there. Regular coaching's each week to touch base with your supervisor on what needs improvement.
good,Renault Nissan Automotive Private India Limited outsourced finance department to Xerox.Inc. I worked as Finance Executive I was responsible for timely accounting the production material purchase invoices with accuracy in respect of PO terms and conditions. Booking down payment request and knocking off. Handling vendor payment related queries. Co-ordination for audits.
good,I would get to work a little earlier then usual to set up my workspace then clock in at the begining of my shift. I would answer calls when they come and do emails to resolve customers issues. When an unusual situation occurs my coworkers would recomand options and vise versa. I would follow my schedule on time everyday till the end of my shift. At the end of every two weeks we would have a team review and see what we need to improve on and bounce ideas off each other. My coworkers were a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job was to work with aggressive and irritated customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was when an issue has been resolved and afterwords hearing the customer rejoice. I learned that sometimes the answers don't always lay in your tools and thinking outside the box can help resolve issues. Going over and beyond to help customers will pay off in the end.
good,"The work environment is really fun. Has a lot of activities for the employers. Answered technical calls. Hardest part of the job is the long hours. No life outside of work and if you're a student, it is a lot worse."
good,We were only a part of Xerox for a third of the years I spent with this company. I believe the greater Xerox would be a good company to work for.
good,The most enjoyable part of the day is the variation of work that is performed and the day to day interactions with professional engineers.
good,"Good work area, Nice break room and easy to get to. Xerox will not have you work in bad weather. The location is good for lunch and to take care of personal business."
good,My typical day consist of coming to work and doing my job to the best of my ability. Of the time I have been here I have learned alot and am still learning everyday. I love my job and enjoy my co-workers but I just wish the pay was a little bit better to compensate my commute to work.
good,"Don't expect to get many advancement opportunities as the retention rate is horrible. Very hard regulations to remember and not paid enough for the amount of work you are required to do, Very unprofessional application process as well hiring process. Make sure you keep up with your own hours; you may have to wait until your next pay period to get your paycheck if their system didn't dump your hours.  Rude supervisors who are not educated at all. Highest paid agent makes 10.00 an hr. Even the glorified ""Floor Walking"" position makes 10.00 and even some supervisors are set at.... 10.00/hr. Good luck with this job. Its a good job if you enjoy the ""ghetto"""
good,Good place to gain skills and knowledge of ground breaking technologies. Very stable environment and decent management. No place for promotions or pay increase.
good,"Cobrança de serviços fora do horário de trabalho. Exigência de locomoção, sem consultar o funcionário."
good,"Long hours required due to limited support resources"
good,Not a bad place to work unless you have young children. You will need daycare for the rotating shifts. You never know what you gone get.
good,"Great place to work, helpful co workers, great management, hardest part of this job was having to perform with very little formal training. I enjoyed the relaxed yet professional institution."
good,"Aggressive patients, low management support, moral very low. Took love of job and desire to help patients main reason for even coming to work."
good,"The people and clients I interacted with on a daily basis were very smart, hard-working and created a family-like culture."
good,"Some of the management is great and some arent, You can succeed if you get the right supervisor. The envirnment is laid back and cool once you get out if training but you have to be on a team where they actually care about you."
good,Loved working with clients. The work itself was great. Highly technical and enjoyed the database work. Worried about the assignment ending too soon. Always hearing from other consultants that we were going to lose the engagement. Hard to get comfortable enough to do a great job when you worry so much.
good,Constant inbound calls with very little time in between. Learned how to provide great customer service. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers.
good,Great Work Place with friendly employees. Exceptional team and floor leaders. The toughest part of the job is maintaining emotional control while on a disruptive call
good,Good place to be..i loved the fact that everyday was different.. not predictable...because we did several jobs for clients
good,"Xerox is a great conglomerate to work for. They offer opportunities for growth, especially if you're apt to learning and comprehending new information. We took between 200-300 calls per day along with 400-600 patient inquiries per day as well. The hardest part of the job was the point system and if you have a sick child be prepared to be in danger of losing your job. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new material and helping the patients."
good,"We were taking calls for Verizon Wireless. I had a lot of different jobs there, we went though a lot of different GM. The friends that I made there were awesome people to work with."
good,Attended training classes for better job performance.  Established good relationships with co-workers.  Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my co-workers and refreshed my skills.
good,"A good place to work."
good,Company needs to provide longer breaks for works doing longer shifts. Working for Xerox was a very learning experience and provided me with more knowledge about the telecommunications field.
good,I enjoyed my brief time there and found it not to be difficult. If you can handle heavy call volumes and angry customers it is an easy job.
good,"Balance life , management is good , co-workers are helpful , onsite-offsite model is good to work with , recommended to work with"
good,"I spend all day on the phone with providers, helping them with the members benefits. I have learned a great deal about health insurance policies. Managment is really helpful and good to the worker. There is a big turn around of employees because the pay is not what it should be for the stress you are under. The hardest part about this job is trying to actually like it. The most enjoyable part is the hours."
good,"As a contract employee in the QA lab in manufacturing, I was able to determine what type position I wanted at Xerox. I was exposed to the service documentation as a user and decided that I would pursue a position in the documentation organization."
good,"This was my second job in my whole life and it was decent. I didn't have any problem with the job, management, or coworkers. I met a few new people there as well. There were also considerate of your outside life as well. Really like that job!!"
good,Good place of employment with lots of online training available. Career advancement is generally stagnant in the middle east.
good,"While this is a great starting point for a career, it's not one for a true business professional.  Poor recruitment, compensation and organizational structure render this company from becoming a true dominate force in the outsourcing world.  One or two ""Gold Star"" clients"" keep this company's reputation impressive but profits and working conditions are severely sacrificed in order to do so."
good,"Assisted clients requirements,  Learned various Administrative skills.  several Managers, good relationship with co-workers "
good,"Managing 4 members of staff"
good,"A rotina chegar sempre antes do horário, abrir os e-mail verificar quantos colaboradores estavam logados."
good,Had and opportunity to learn new skills and meet/work with some amazing people. It was a great job to be able to get so quickly after moving to a new state and also provided a nice transition from being a stay at home mom to once again being a part of the work force.  I am also very thankful that I was given the opportunity to become a licensed professional.
good,"Great Work Place - But Rare Opportunities for Perm Positions. Love the Place of Business, but Temp to Perm is Non Existent. More of Only Temp Positions available for the Lot of the company."
good,"Tightly managed, profit-oriented. Great platform to learn interpersonal and management skills. Career progression is open to anyone willing to step up and prove they can handle the role."
good,"Xerox was great pay for what I consider to be not a whole lot of in-depth work. A multitude of training materials were available to us at all times too, so researching issues for customers was quite simple. I had a good time with the contract at Xerox."
good,I really didn't like the environment at Xerox all that much. It seemed to me like there was favoritism shown to certain employees and I felt very frustrated because of it. I was merely there to fill a desk and earn benefits to be able to take care of myself.
good,It alright working there but it doesn't have security. I think that no one should have to go to work and don't know if its their last day. The co workers are great people. Xerox is a type of job that doesn't care about what u have going on at home. They give you a set time schedule and the next day you are forced to be on a new schedule. Its okay if you like that type of work though.
good,I love being apart the Apple Team! It was the best to sit there and walk a customer through each troubleshooting step there was and resolve their problems!
good,Dramatic workplace within leadership. compensation does not match workload given. work life balance does not even out. favoritism.
good,"Xerox has a good core values that drives employees to enhance their full potentials. Management encourages every employee to participate in every activities that each business units are developing. The employees provide positive feedbacks in terms of delivering their performance. Should one fail on one aspect of the service level, they take it positively and improve their working behavior to attain positive results."
good,"Aprendi sobre relacionamento em equipe, a integração com colegas de trabalho era muito gratificante."
good,loved working here with my friends and family awesome place to get your career started in the right direction highly recommend
good,"I would not like to review this company at this time.  "
good,"Xerox is a company which provides opportunities for entry level as well as very experienced employees. They also provide flexibility n schedules, which is great for family life/work balance. It is a very diverse workplace, and the employees are all easy to get along with, and share a common goal-doing their best and providing great service."
good,"nothing too bad to say about this place honestly although every now and again they  force you to do mandatory over time, which was fine for me but often sometimes people have a second job or have families which can make it hard to want to accommodate especially when the re unwilling to bend, btw they take massive amounts of your pay if you do not comply with the mandatory OT which they spring up last second. again it was fine for a young single guy like me but any co workers became disgruntled and begrudging.... management couldn't understand as to why this was a problem. Also made it a problem if you took the bus as the site was in Webster where busses stop running after a certain time at night"
good,"Xerox was an okay place to work.  I have worked for worse companies, overall.  It is not without its faults, but no workplace isn't."
good,"Average for a call center."
good,"Installed Weblogic server 9.2/10.3/11g and created clustered Weblogic server instances according to the requirements in LINUX and Windows Server"
good,"Jan-2004 till Date	 "
good,"I never had any issues with this job. Wish I could've stayed longer, just did have transportation. Management was pretty awesome"
good,Pretty much like any other Call Center that serves as a Contractor. Decent pay but HARD work. Be prepared to have to meet stats monthly and get screamed at by strangers.
good,"Excellent working relationship with Customers, Oversees 90 PCS, in a high paced enviroment,	Responding to Remedy service desk requests/incidents to meet customer SLAs (4 hour response, 2 hour fix)"
good,It was a stressful position. I decided to retire and follow my passion.
good,"Xerox is often unfairly maligned by employees.  There are definitely problems with Xerox's corporate culture, but the company is not the amoral, use-employees-until-they-are-utterly-spent monster it's so often portrayed as.  "
good,"Xerox has a lot of good natured and hardworking people. Its a close knit community and everyone looks out for each other. Management is usually not on your back as long as your doing what your are required to do. I've learned a lot here. There is always a wide variety of training available to all employees to further their developmental needs. Most days are not typical. The day starts in the field at an account and you can either be there for 5 minutes or 2 hours depending of the issue your trying to resolve. The company has 401K and pension programs as well as Transit Checks. The only complaint is the lack of promotion. Most positions are held by senior employees that are trying to keep their jobs or the company itself is dong a lot of cutbacks and are not hiring anyone. In addition employees have not been seeing regular raises for years, many many years."
good,"It's an OK place to work at. I have enjoyed and learned a lot while working here. I learned lot a bout new networking technologies, processes. The hardest part is that we don't get salary increases very often. The good thing about this company is that is international I had the chance to travel to several places."
good,"Interesting work environment, culture is outstanding. Client focused. Will recommend well qualified candidates to review the company and see employment opportunities."
good,"I enjoy working here, but I am looking for something that is permanent for me to move up within the company."
good,"The job had great benefits like good pay and insurance, but the turn over rate is very high"
good,Responsibilities included managing off-shore IT production support and development model using scrum methodology.
good,"not really a place I would consider making a career"
good,this job comes with a lot of stress but if you are a true customer care advocate you will like this job.
good,It was a good experience I learned how to handle multiple customer interactions on a daily basis I defiantly enjoyed it .
good,"I liked that we were able to be trained on what we were about to learn. I enjoyed my trainer as well as my co-workers. I left because they were not able to work with my school schedule, but it was a great place to work. Hardest part of my job was dealing with the rude customers on the phone"
good,"Muti-tasking is a must here. Between screens and customers, being able to fully comprehend and breakdown the situation, it can be stressful. I learned how to really pay attention to strict detail and read between the lines more here."
good,I have worked at the company for several years and still not happy with the current pay and the new location.
good,"Xerox overall, I believe is a great company but the management was very nonchalant. I went to management for a series of issues I was having in the work place and they showed a big lack of care for any of my issues. My supervisor I had was great, she did her best to tend to me as well as other advisors needs."
good,"Open enrollment, benefits, pension plans, 401K, attendance, short term disability, long term disability, HIPPA compliance."
good,Work day ususally involve getting into a work que.Working productively through the day and being accepting of changes throughout the work day.
good,My office is local project office and not a corporate office.  It is a great place to work for anyone looking to build on their skill set.  Although it is a very demanding place to work and late hours are the norm.
good,great place to start working straight out of college i had a lot of fun there
good,"A typical day would require me to be done early. I dealed with spreadsheets and word excel. I enjoyed it for the mlost part. I would go in type information and verify people information. Management was a little hard , but I always got the job done."
good,"Xerox had recently purchased ACS and was in the process of integrating ACS into Xerox when I joined the company.  ACS had won the $1.6 billion Medi-cal MMIS contract in 2010 over EDS, who previously held the contract for 28 years.  During  my tenure with the company, ACS was following PMI, laying out the management plans in order to manage the MMIS Replacement effort."
good,"Typical call center work. "
good,"Learned a lot about medications and what they are for"
good,"I feel this work environment is very stress-full [at this time in my life]. The environment promotes competition. There exists very little comradeship, especially in the department I work in."
good,The people are awesome. The job is a good job to have. I just wish that the qa did not exist.
good,"A typical day involved searching for a desk/station as seating is not assigned. Logging in to computer systems and verifying your headset is set up properly to take calls. Before starting the day review any new post pertaining to changes that affect services offered, and any other notifications of scheduling including mandatory overtime dates. My job consisted of answering inbound calls in a call center environment pertaining to issues or inquiries  involving debit cards that are issued by the government ie: social security benefits, child support, and unemployment benefits. My co-workers were for the most part pretty easy to get along with and were very helpful when I had any questions. Employees are encouraged to assist one another and rely on one another to learn, grow, and progress. The Hardest part of the job was trying to deescalate calls or reason with cardholders who were missing funds or had funds missing due to identity theft. Trying to keep calls short while answering any inquiries and educating customers of services that are available to them can be difficult if customer is already upset. The most enjoyable part would have to be the fact that if you do your job well enough and have a good attitude management will take notice and help you to move up in the company fairly fast. Supervisors are very helpful and encourage asking questions."
good,"Een typische werkdag start met goeiedag te zeggen als je binnenkomt.  's Morgens ben ik vrij energiek en ik start met de intensievere taken zoals feedback schrijven, analyses maken van trainingen, inplannen van trainingen.  De namiddag hou ik vrij voor meetings en coachings. Een typische trainingsdag start met een uitgebreide kennismaking.  Het is voor mij belangrijk dat ik weet wie ik in training heb en ik probeer steeds de namen van de deelnemers te gebruiken.  Dit maakt het ook voor de deelnemers persoonlijker. Het moeilijkste van de baan als trainer is om afscheid te moeten nemen van mensen die de motivatie bezitten om te werken, doch niet de benodigde vaardigheden en competenties.  Het leukste van de baan is dat je iedereen die binnen het bedrijf start ook daadwerkelijk kent bij naam."
good,Pretty good job to have and work for is your getting hired full time. But the whole process of trying to get hired through a project based postion is very draining.
good,Had online courses which you could access at home or at work and self development was always encouraged.
good,"recieve calls from the dispatcher."
good,The company is no longer Xerox Solutions.  The company was sold and the new name is Getixhealth
good,"I learned lot more thing from this company , like self motivating and how to handle the critical situations and how to behave in company areas .. with clients ..."
good,"A high tempo job, where I was given my own space. Traveling around inner city limits to 5-7 calls per day, fixing photocopiers. There was always a new problem you had never seen before, which was great because you were constantly learning."
good,"Answered questions for bookings (Hotels/resorts, airlines, rental cars and attrations) for Customers via email and phones. Also answered questions for team mates, trained new team members, and audits of team mates emails. I enjoyed learning about the travel business, working with customers to help them out with their travel questions, reservations and complaints."
good,"I am currently working in a contracted position with Xerox for the employee open enrollment for their medical benefits. Answering phones, enrolling benefits, sending cases to administration for updates"
good,Xerox is a good company. Your always getting training on a monthly basis.

good,"work is clear and to the point."
good,Working for Xerox allowed me to have various job titles during  the years of employment.
good,"Currently working as an open enrollment representative, took calls for one company for three days before transferred to another team based out of Arizona with absolutely no notice ahead of time. Still working at the Cary office, but taking half-assed training over the phone. While the managers are generally pleasant people, I get the feeling they have little idea what they're doing. Four reps (myself included) were taken off our client and forced into phone training, and call volume has dramatically increased for the old client as a direct result. Phones now ring back to back with very little time in between, and people are given leave time due to low call volume."
good,"I have ulimited access to learn everyday more information about Human Resources and Benefits Administration.I also like the fact that I have the priviledge to work from home.  However, there is no room for growth or advancement."

good,"Usual tasks, Good working relationship with co-workes and clients"
good,"I really enjoy working for Xerox. On a typical day at work i come in with intentions on making sure at the end of every call my customer is happy. I learned that working with customers, it's all about customer satisfaction. My management team is very supportive. My co-workers are always supportive if no management was around. The hardest part of my job is maintaining a positive attitude towards customers that were upset about their phones not working. The most enjoyable part about my job is making sure the customers get off the phone with me with a smile on his/her face."
good,"I refilled medicines over the phone. The job is not hard. I processed orders over the phone, took transactions and explain insurance benefits."
good,Good place to work however no raises or way to move up with a raise.
good,Answering phones from medicare members and assisting them with medication orders.
good,"Working for Xerox gave me a great opportunity to enter into the world of healthcare. Coming in with no call center experience, they gave me a chance to learn and eventually grow with the company. I started out as a customer care associate who would take incoming calls from Humana members with questions about their coverage."
good,"Interacting with my co workers and management is very enjoyable. Assisting provider with questions on pay, setting up electronic fund transfers, tracing lost. misplaced  or returned checks."
good,Xerox was a nice place to work. The company needed more structure
good,"Not a bad place but again, just another ""numbers"" game. There isn't much to tell, really."
good,this was an pretty ok job i just think that the company could of been manage a little better
good,It was time to move on. I wasn't happy with the position they gave me.

good,This company has provided great retirement benefits experience. I enjoy my position as QA specialist.
good,"As a sales representative for the men’s department, my primary duties were to achieve department sale quotas and merchandizing and designed fashionable clothing layouts.  My daily duties were to meet and greet customers assisting them with their selections creating a productive relationship and their loyalty by addressing all questions, resolution to complex issues and special accommodations.  This gave me a learning opportunity of customer services, partnership skills with other employees."
good,"I sold Computer untied to large , medium, and small companies around the Houston Area. I company was great with copiers but not with office automation."
good,"It's Work. It's okay not that much excitement. We just started this project. This isn't a hard job. I picked it up overtime. Wish training was at least okay. I went through 3 trainers but was told the other training classes before me went through more, so I cant complain. I enjoy the customers but i wish i had some breathing time between my calls 30 secs but I work for tech support."
good,"I liked being able to work overtime, and what hours worked best for my family. I did not like how management talked to you like you were nothing and how the people you worked with would just belittle you."
good,"Good place to work to build up experience,oppourtunity for OT and u do learn a variety of different skills,there is constantly training for new skills."
good,Great Company to work for I've been with the company for eleven years and I enjoyed every day of it.
good,"The company is really good when it comes to getting your bonus if you are a good representative. However, it is the same stuff just a different day. You are unable to do all of the stuff that you have too because you are not authorized. Therefore, it has to get approved by a supervisor which can just go straight in one ear and out the other and you have to keep nagging at your supervisor until it gets done. There are shift bids which happen every 6 months, which isn't too bad if you want to change your shift, however, if you do not, then you just have to hope for the best. The way that you have to ask for time off or paid time are is a lot different than most companies. The workplace is just filthy. It's almost like working where the plague is. People are always getting sick and you always have to wipe down your area because there are so many people in that one building that everyone shuffles around. Not a bad location though. People are always coming in and out so it's not much of a community. The most enjoyable part about the job is the feeling of helping someone with their cell phone and you can hear it in their voice that you've just made their day."
good,"The implementation of an ability based compensation, 2 years ago, gave me a great opportunity to make more than I ever expected. However the pay scale has been lowered by 50% and this job does not have any opportunity for advancement. Therefore I will leave when given the opportunity."
good,I've been fortune to work with some mature and intelligent people.
good,"Knowing who you are what your mission is in this life,has a way of bringing passion out of me,working as a sales rep is something i can do without complaint.However as a result of time and exposure in this field and area of work i have gain varied exprience,to carry out the duties involved as compatetive sales and marketing represantative of any organisation on earth."
good,"I go to work with a great attitude. As quality analyst, well, you hear just about everything."
good,"A typical day of work at Xerox was sitting in a chair talking calls from customers. I learned that I have more patience than I though with having to put customers on hold for support. I didn't quite agree with the training, seven weeks of training and once I was through it I didn't feel like I was educated enough to do my job the best. The hardest part of working at Xerox was getting yelled at because you don't know the answer and don't want to lie to a customer when you can't find the answer and want to ask someone else their is never anybody around to help."
good,good product is company but its a telleshopphing company so same problem as
good,"Provide hospital staff concerning network and application services to identify, support, and resolve technical service related issues.   "
good,"Mi jornada laboral era de 9 horas. "
good,I currently work at Xerox Services and a typical day here at work is interesting. I learn more and more about certain benefits that are provided to clients. Management is great as well as my coworkers. We all get along well and my supervisor works well with helping us solve any issue we may have. There aren't many hard things about the job. I enjoy coming to work everyday and working with people to get their benefits where they need them to be and also making them feel comfortable with me handling their benefits.
good,The job itself is not bad when all systems are operating properly.
good,"Friendly environment "
good,Xerox is a nice place to work if you don't mind having flexible hours. There's not much room for growth and the pay does not increase like it should.
good,"A great group of people to work with. My co-workers are extremely smart, and have taught me skills that I would love to apply to new employment."

good,"Due to Sprint cell service struggling during my time there it was not always enjoyable day to day."
good,This was a wonderful company to work for. The work environment was awesome (off the beach).
good,"A typical day would be sitting on the phone all day taking calls from members who needed medications filled at pharmacy. Would place orders and let them know if the insurance plan would cover the medication. Had to learn about each of the plans that the customers had. The hardest part of the job were the small things on different accounts that would constantly chance. The best part of the job was that you had good job security, also good supervisors."
good,"A typical work day for me includes processing new and existing applications, data entry, income verification from 9-12:30pm and form 12:30-5;00pm I take incoming calls from parents assisting them with information about their premium payments and eligibility status. What I enjoy most about my job is research and resolving complex situations with accounts. I've learned how to be a team player, excellent floor coach for new hires and how to management workflows"
good,Great place to work... Come in meet and greet with the team then its off to your duties. Management wasn't the best but as long as you knew your job you were fine and there was always someone there to help.
good,I enjoyed sub-contracting for Xerox. I worked at BMW Corporate under contract. The experience has taught me a great deal working with people on all levels.
good,Supervise 18-25 associates on a daily basis. Coaches associates to deliver excellent customer service.
good,"fast paced, challenging, great people, most challenging is having to meet daily deadlines"

good,Xerox is a overall great place to work. Mondays and Fridays are the most craziest days however the job is simple and easy. Depending on The shifts the mangers are great my co-workers are the best I love them as family. The most enjoyable part of my job is actually making my customers happy.

good,"You can learn alot from the company, but arent paid enough for the work you do."
good,"To handle the client along with team."
good,"Overall its a great place to get your feet wet as a young professional. However the company does not issue annual raises and there hardly any opportunity for internal advancement. So overall, get a job and get two-four years of experience, and start your job hunt over again."
good,I have learned how to calculated pension benefits for one of the toughest clients that we offer services too.
good,"Good people to work with"
good,De hele dag orders picken. Er is geen afwisseling in de werkzaamheden.
good,It's a big company know world wide. A typical work day would be prepping and imaging loan documents.
good,"Based on my current position a typical day is productivity.  The people are all different and fun to get along with.  Sincerity is of value in this newly operation of Government Healthcare.  I have learned numerous systems and processes for they are all new and change each hour of the day.  Accuracy is beneficial for success of this job."
good,In at 8:00 am work til 5:30. I learned alot about prescirptions and processing refills for people. Management was ok nothing beyond that. Co workers were ok we did our best to work as a team. The hardest paart of the job was working with bad computers and systems that were down as much as they were up. The best part was helping the members with there problems.
good,"Heb het altijd goed naar mij zin gehad, niet een bedrijf waar ik in me kon groeien."
good,"Avoid it. Job duties include: micromanagement, not being able think freely, promotions based on friendships not job performance, and an overall desire to not go to work."

good,"Quando ero in ufficio mi gestivo le pratiche dei clienti ovvero i rapporti lavoro e le modifiche effettuate."
good,"My work focus was to ensure that my customers were happy and that their files were properly maintained."
good,the typical work days is filled with chaos due to lack of customer management and communication.  There is a lack of management level direction.  all the employees are a joy to work with.  the hardest part about this job is to know when to let things just roll off your back as the environment is challenging and everyone is always having to react instead of being proactive.
good,The job at xerox is enjoyable. Easy jobs and we are able to perform different jobs instead of being stuck at in one position. Management is loose and Human resources does not enforce rules which is bother some when people constantly come in late or leave without asking and have no consequences. Hardest part of the job is the times when we have large amounts of work that we must process within a time limit. Most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom we have with no micromanaging.
good,"Empresa familiar, possibilidade de aprender a gerir uma equipe maior   (com mais setores fora da minha especialização)."
good,"Nice Place to work. very good environment."
good,Xerox is a good place for beginner IT.  As a tier one technical advisor my job is to handle customer issues within 10 min
good,"Hired under contract. Independent work in cubicle. Same tasks all day, could be boring at times."
good,"Depending on the time of season, a day at Xerox rewarding or you may feel taken advantage of. The excessive mandatory overtime can be stressful especially when they tell you about it usually a day or two before the fact. However, overtime = money and that is why we work.  This job did enable me to enhance my customer service capabilities and develop an office professional work demeanor. Working for both Sprint, and Humana insurance I regularly access customer accounts and see how their specifics are set up, help with payments, and coverages etc. values I believe I can carry far with me in the work world Managing tends to have a lot on their mind and when you ask for help they may have an apparent attitude but just keep in mind everyone has a job to do. The hardest part of the job is when calls come in back to back and your midway thru a 10-12 hour shift. During my time with the company I've enjoyed the professional yet friendly atmosphere, co-workers and management are all good people,  room for advancement and bonuses, great job for someone just getting out of out of high school or college and needing employment, great stepping stone for future careers."
good,"it was a fast pace type of job,which i enjoyed because it made time go by quicker. Multi tasking is also fun for me because doing the same thing over and over could get boring.a typical day at work,log on and take calls right away,sitting there taking calls for 4 straight hours until your first break.Deal with irate customers regarding their bill or account.if supervisor for your team is busy helping someone else,and you need assistance,you have to wait til someone can help you,and while your waiting,you have your customer on hold which you get in trouble for if you leave them on hold a certain amount of time.The hardest part of the job is dealing with the angry customers and trying your best to compromise with them and do your best to assist them.The only thing i enjoyed about this job was the experience because now i know what to expect from telemarking or telecommunication te of jobs."
good,The position allowed for growth of knowledge in multiple healthcare systems. The ability to work with clients and other team members is at a premium.
good,"Answers customer's calls or correspondence regarding the Health Care insurance billing claims procedure code, ctp code, assisting customer with prescription benefits different tier hand on train with multiple system such as Genelco, Apm, Rumba, Ref Electronics, company's products about new policies and cost or existing customer policies verbal communication skills written communication skills handle policy changes and renewals, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Good typing skills and advance computer skills."
good,My job with Xerox allows me to have contact with people from all walks of life.
good,"A typical day at Xerox was usually very busy, taking anywhere between 60-110 calls a day, I learned how to work in a hectic environment and to meet customers needs. I also had the privilege of helping the supervisors with grading calls, walking the floor to answer any questions, taking supervisor calls, overall helping. The co-workers are very friendly, I've met some of the best people working at Xerox and I've continued to have a strong relationship with most of the people from there. The hardest part of working at Xerox was the constant stress, and not being able to have a break in-between calls, it was one right after another. The most enjoyable part was the people I had the opportunity to meet."
good,Learned to juggle several priority tasks at once in a high volume arena.
good,"Typical Call Center environment, very strict but fair management. "
good,"Overall pretty good company, although it was situations where there would be activity that shouldnt be displayed at work. It was an okay company to be affiliated with."
good,"A typical work day for a CSR is sitting in front of a computer and helping customers with billing questions or questions about devices, although the job tasks are enjoyable you are very cut off from other employees. Also, supervisors are often shorthanded so if you have a question about something that you can not find in the system it is hard to get a timely response."
good,"Great Company to work for with schedule flexibility, Benefits and Opportunities to grow."
good,"Come into work badge in, Go straight to my desk and sign onto the pc , clock in and start answering phone calls, after two hours ill take a first break and then get back to work, You may get more time off phone if you have coaching, or a team meeting."
good,I would get to talk to a wide variety of people everyday in all sorts of different states and even some in England. Overall it was not the right job for me.
good,Xerox formally known as ACS has been a great starter entry level job that has gave me the opportunity to learn just about everything that I need to know about an office job.
good,At work everything changes from one day to another when there are policies and procedures put into place. Xerox is a vendor site company whom work with other companies to become profitable. The pay fluctuates dramatically making it hard to know what the pay check will look like. The management team is not on one accord.
good,I liked working for xerox however chose to leave due to unstable work enviroment
good,"Good working place, supportive colleagues, enjoyed my stint."
good,"Answering customers questions about their bills,new services,explaing bills"
good,This job was very stressful. You have to be able to work in an environment where you cannot expect the same thing everyday. Working with people over the phone you can never expect what they are going to say. The hardest part of this job was that it was not always organized anytime a customer needed/wanted to speak with a manager the bump up process was a joke! sometimes I had to stand there with my had up for up to 45 minutes (with the customer yelling in my ear because it was talking so long) before a manager could take my call. The part I enjoyed the most was being able to work with the public and being able to resolve any issues they had.
good,"My typical day at work is spent on the phone on average 8 hours a day taking inbound calls from customers with issues regarding their cellular device or bills. "
good,"Call center environment, managers are still new and learning process also. Hardest part, information changes very often."
good,Fun working environment. Superior Xerox sales training. Good working experience.
good,the first job I really loved. my managers and co-workers were great. even the customers were great.
good,this job has no room for dedication.. the only way to get ahead at this job is to kiss up.. will never consider going back..
good,"Starting with the company in 2010 I advanced quickly. I was an agent only for 8 months and then was promoted to my current position as a Learning and Development Specialist. A typical day of my duties would include facilitating all new hires that are hires with the company which would include the policies and procedures and how to effectively manuver throughout the systems and take phone calls effectively. The most enjoyable part about my my position would include the traveling. Just recently I went to Phoenix, AZ as well to San Juan, PR."
good,"The job was great by itself, but unless you were part of one of the managements ""group"" you better watch out."
good,"Maintained employee training records, managed training schedules for 32 courses, coordinated training materials for upcoming courses, responded to phone and email inquires regarding training courses. I worked closely with my co-workers to ensure proper coverage for our area.  I enjoy the variety of the position, working with course owners and students."
good,"Good learning opportunity, limited growth opportunity, great team members, lot of scope for staying close to technology."
good,great company to work for very fast paced.  The customers are the most important making sure they are highly satisfied with there services.
good,Great place to work! Rewarding work and they take care of people who work hard.
good,"The company has lots CSR job's available. There is very little room to move up in the company. Pay raises never occurred. Management is very friendly at face value only which can be good or bad."
good,it is a job. it  paid the bills but don't have room to grow. a lot of politics going on. work hard not much pay. it was just a job
good,trabalho  no qual tinha muito orgulho pois foi nessa empresa que começei a ter uma vida melhor e pessoas que me ajudaram muito a dar o primeiro passo para crescer.
good,"Verizon call center, with a lot of different co-workers. The customers you speak to can make or break your day. A lot of ways to improve personally at your job, constant training."

good,"Empresa agradável de trabalhar,porém sem expectativas de crescimento."
good,Very challenging and interesting work environment.  I learned a lot about the healthcare industry.
good,"This company is no longer in business"
good,"Productive input and good team work.After Disney outsourced the IT division to both IBM and ACS Inc (who I became an employee of) there was an ""adjustment"" period. This was made much easier my management by providing good support both professionally and personal level. Once the ""dust"" settled it became a very comfortable work environment."
good,Een dag in de callcenterbranch is nooit hetzelfde als een dag eerder of de dag daarvoor. Communicatie staat vooraan; niet alleen van CSR naar de klant maar ook van leidinggevende naar teamleden in alle lagen. Het leukste van een dergelijke baan is het contact met de mensen. Het lastigste is het combineren van de ad hoc zaken met de dagelijkse werkzaamheden. Dit maakt het werk wel een enorme uitdaging.
good,"Llegar al trabajo, iniciar el dia revisando si hay pendientes,posteriormente realizar mis responsabilidades. He aprendido a realizar las facturas, cotizar como debe ser a los clientes, me pone estresante el que relacionen la vida personal,familiar con lo laboral, para todo hay un tiempo."
good,"Good company, flexible and comfortable environment. great standards."
good,I was a team manager and enjoyed the people I worked with.  Being in customer service can be challenging at times ad I had to deal with irate customers often.

good,"A typical day at work is us sorting through first class, and third class mail, us having to attend to customers, up keeping our MFDs, and also delivering mail and first priority packages to our customers in a timely manner. I learned quite a lot, I learned how to sort through first and third class mail. I also learned how to fix and up keep MFD's, and also I learned how to multi-task while providing excellent customer service to our customers. My co-workers were extremely professional, cultured, detailed, and very attentive, I enjoyed working with my co-workers. Management was highly professional, lenient as far as personal issues, detail oriented, and also versatile. The most difficult part of the job was up keeping the MFDs while delivering packages in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job, is being able to start my shift early and also leave early in the afternoon."
good,"I enjoyed the one on one contact with customers,  It was rewarding to present customer with finished project.  I had great people that I supervised.  I think that management should have been held more responsible for their short comings."
good,It can be a good experience for employees. If you like to travel and meet new people all the time.
good,I was responsible for answering as many phone call I could per night for Verizon Wireless prepaid customers as well as providing floor support for other agents in need and handling an escalated phone line when needed.  I took away a great multi-tasking ability and a new sense of confidence in the way I interact with others.  Computer proficiency was a must for the job.  The co-workers were great people who always made it entertaining to come into work but there wasn't the sense of support from the management one would expect from a high pressured call center.
good,"I think their approach to take to market was unclear."
good,Quick start if necessary. I would only recomend this job for students if your schedule fits.
good,"decent work environment, it is a very busy and fast pace call enter. We are always meeting new challenges and changes."

good,"Scanning and indexing of documents for the client we were contracted to.  Coke Cola Amatil."
good,Great co-workers and managers. Learned customer service and leadership skills.
good,"Xerox was a very fast paced job. We constantly worked at meeting our printing deadlines. Although machines would go down, and we had to work through a remodel. We all maintained a professional and upbeat work environment and managed to keep up with various deadlines. The hardest part of the job was working the uncontrollable temperatures, we constantly had to call maintenance to help with regulating the temperature in our office due to the fact that we were in the basement of a major city hospital so that was very stressful at times. My fellow co-workers were great, easy to work with most of them had already work there for years, so they were use to the pace and were very helpful. This job allowed me to enhance my skill at building relationships with clients, and project management and becoming more resourceful."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Xerox. The skills I aquired at while working for this company will be valueable in the future. A typical day included taking any where from 75 to 100 calls in a face paced, ever changing environment."
good,"Working the over night or grave yard shift. Did two sets of rounds and check points. Occasionally miscellaneous duties (walk female staff to car or let in venders/medical personal). I learned the importance of being accountable and professional. Management was not very involved with me or others at the time. Co-workers were normal, distant and professional. The boredom was the hardest and the day last night assignment of guarding the rear parking garage also came with running the American flag up and a few other special easy assignments. "
good,After going through training be sure be putting in applications in other places just in case you don't make the cut.
good,"The job is demanding without enough compensation.  "
good,"Running a busy print production operations with additional service offerings. To keep up with the requests from key clients Capgemini/ Fujitsu and HMRC and to develop account revenue streams in order to meet Xerox revenue targets. To manage a team and look at how we could implement improvements to the services offered by replacing machinery, offering decentralised print solutions and . becoming embedded in the client business . The work was very varied and volumes to cover high, attention to detail was very important. The hardest part of the job was trying to ensure all uk hubs were using the services and marketing the site to the correct line managers. I learnt the importance of delivering exceptional customer service, to be aware of the outside competition in your industry and to win contract renewals. I enjoyed dealing with contract account reviews and presenting new business products and services and the site won team of the year for the amount of business I won from other companies."
good,"The last position held with Xerox was as a ""Scanner"".  I really loved the challenge of scanning thousands of documents and helping the team meet its goals.  However Xerox is the sub contractor to GENWORTH-and many of the jobs were shipped to India."
good,"Xerox is a large corporation that keeps track of everything, how the expense reports are spent, how vacation and sick time is spent, rejecting ideas left and right that would benefit the morale of the office. Pay raises are not automatic when there are promotions. How is that normal? We experience 100% turnover. Xerox considers this normal. Literally, they told our office, which was struggling to keep the underpaid employees, that 100% turnover is completely normal. "
good,Working in the Nations Capital and working in all of the Nationally recognized organizations was a great learning experiance. I learned from a company that had the best management and problem solving skills in the world.
good,"A typical day at work involves finding new business, developing additional services or solution with existing clients, customer service with end user issues that include but limited to billing, service, and end user training.  Always finding way that services and technology can  help customers create efficiencies while creating cost containment strategies. "

good,Always learned something new everyday when speaking to clients
good,"After working in this company I dont feel  it fits mt same work ethics or value I am looking for a different work standard"
good,A typical day at work is consistently communicating with beneficiary's on the phone that need Part D (prescription coverage). The hardest part of the job is explainging to a beneficiary the same thing a previous representatuve has informed them but in a different context. Management plays a different role then co-workers. Management has more freedom and getting away with certain things but co-workers may be fired on spot.
good,"To be perfectly honest what I enjoy most about my job is the people I work with. That is was has kept me here for so long. I work 12.5 hour shifts minus 30 minutes for lunch. The hardest part of the job is rotating from days to nights and back again and not having off weekends."

good,This company is going through changes at this time from ACS to Xerox.  They have to many changes being placed and not giving the management/operation managers and supervisor time to set the changes in place.  It takes 30 to 60 days to turn around new policies for 600 plus employees. Every week they made changes and wanted the changes to be done within a week with 600 employees and no training at the time I was there.  
good,"Its a great environment to work and learn which I find admirable because I love to learn new things everyday. I improved in my knowledge about different operating systems, customer relation, and data management. The most enjoyable part of the job is the learning aspect. Employees have access to basic knowledge base materials. The hardest part of the job is the leadership characters, quite unfriendly and a bit judgmental. I see people quit at the middle of the job everyday. That is heart-breaking!"

good,"In the Raleigh region, I was 1 of 3 employees including a Design Engineer and our Sales Rep, my manager was stationed in Charlotte.  It was a very independent environment.  Working from home was very common since no one used the little office space we had while sharing the building with 2 other companies.  My manager had a lose leash on our office, but only because we were able to communicate well and keep him updated with our projects.  This position taught me to work independently and be self-motivated to get done what needed to be done without the pressure of upper management looking over my shoulder.  Being able to make my own schedule was great, but because we were never truly busy, it was often very boring.  I enjoy a fast-paced work environment and this position was the exact opposite.  The Project Manager position was created when I was hired and was eliminated when I was laid off.  Unfortunately there was not enough work in our region to justify having my position.  "
good,"Typical day at work answering incoming phone calls and assisting members with any questions, concerns, and orders."
good,I like this job because I learnt something new every day. That is what I like about going to work. Learning you can never have to much knowledge.

good,"I have one of the most advanced, goal oriented groups in all of Xerox. Our growth has been outstanding over the past 5 years. "
good,Manage and operate all of the phase in printing. Give customer service to all the departments in the building. No co-workers. Hardest part of job is trying to stay busy. Enjoyable part is lunch going outside.
good,Great stepping stone job. If you are looking for an opportunity to get your foot in the door Xerox can assist with that. Along with them being international the sky is the limit.
good,"take calls, answer customer questions and concerns, provide the most accurate information. I learned how to position statements to continue a positive conversation. resolve the problem. I learned how to multi-task between different computer screens, i have learned how to type and talk to my customer at the same time. my co workers are fine i am usually at my cubicle so i generally don't see anyone. The hardest part of the job is all the changes, the lack of communication and all of the misinformation."
good,"A typical day at work here, I'd come to work and sign in to a computer at one of the seats in whatever row I was in that day, and then I would sit and take calls for 2 hours and with the usual breaks and lunch. I learned a lot about customer service and how to handle angry or upset customers, I also learned a lot of patience from this job."
good,The hardest thing for me was that I coundn't take talking to people and having them yell to me over the phone when it wasn't even my fault.
good,1) you get paid per sheet or batch
good,"I work from 10am to 630 pm,Monday-Saturday.I have learned to fill prescriptions,track orders,solve problems,order consent forms,and warm transfer incoming calls.The management is very understanding,and outgoing.I enjoy my co-workers but,like to stay to myself,most of the time.The hardest part of my job is,dealing with older members who can't hear you,so you have to speak very loud sometimes.I enjoy everything about my job however,I'm looking for a better opportunity."
good,"Typical day consisted of between 8 to 12 hour shifts on the phones and computer assisting customers. I learned some basic tecnical support for cell phones. I was not very impressed with most of the management. They seemed more concerned with earning bonuses based on my performance than with actually helping customers or teaching me my job. Enjoyed working with my co-workers. Hardest part of the job was when there really was nothing I could do to help my customer. Most enjoyable part of the job was resolving the customer's problems with their cell phone, service or bill."
good,"The people are great, atmosphere is low key and nice. The job itself is not good"
good,It is a well known company but is having internal problems. They outsourced the sales department in 2009 and the sales dropped drastically.

Shipping and Receiving as well as mailroom expertise. S5 knowledge with cleaning and organizing. My coworkers was awesome to work with. The hardest part of the day was working 15 hours + to get stuff done. My best part was meeting new people."
good,The job isn't the worst considering there are people out here who are unemployed. There are no benefits with penty of work to be done. It's like you're actually working for a temp. service
good,Answering phone calls for Verizon wireless customers
good,Segunda a sexta sempre com trabalho a fazer.
good,I left Xerox because after being employed there for almost a month the supervisors still had not provided me with access to the phone systems. I got up every morning at 6:00 a.m. to literally SIT for 8 hours and do nothing.
good,The people are great but I'm not into the whole contract holding employment thing. Working for a company that makes you work for a different company.
good,"Not a bad place to work as far as environment...The people are nice, the cubicles are spacious. The supervisor and manager are not on your back as long as your not screwing up big-time. The medical plan is horrible the first year. The training is not very good. They go over a company's medical guide but don't really prepare you for the unusual or atypical calls."
good,"worked remotely, 12 hour shifts on a 24x7 support team overnight. My job was to monitor backups overnight. I was to check in problem backups that failed during its backup. Repair them and rerun the backup if possible. If I could not find the problem I was escalated to the next level or called out support if needed. My co-workers were great, very supportive. The hardest part of the job was staying awake when it wasn't super busy but that wasn't often. Management was good. When we needed their support did what needed to be done to get what we needed to do our job."
good,"taking incoming calls from insurance members, I learn how to work in a stressful workplace. management is strict and tough to get production moving in the right order. Co workers is supporting to each other in the workplace. The hardest part of the job is maintain speed with the calls. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting the members /customers with their prescriptions needs."
good,"There are no typical days at work. Of course there are certain tasks to be accomplished every day, receive Fed Ex and UPS deliveries, and answer phone calls. I assist on various projects such as selecting community involvement projects, make travel arrangements, review local venues for off site meetings and training sessions. I manage all aspects of the daily operation of 30 person sales office."

Management offers a basis of help but can sometimes give you conflicting ideologies; Co-workers were young and energetic but had quit a high turn over rate; Hardest part was maintaining unhappy clients due to lack of transparency in other departments (parts/supplies, billing, customer support, etc); Most enjoyable part was the young energetic environment in which my co-workers provided."
good,"Typical day at work involved being on the phones as it is a call center. Helping customers with billing questions, assisting customers find and order the best equipment for them, troubleshooting any issues customers had with the devices they had. I learned some basic tech information. Enjoy working with my fellow co-works, as much as we could interact with each other, being on the phones. Management was a little harder to actually get to know. Hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy and unsatisfied customers and not being able to fix the reason they called in. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers, fixing the reason they called in and ensuring they have an enjoyable experience with us."
good,a typical day at work at this location was a call center environment. Calls were back to back with very outraged customers calling about fraudulent activities with their accounts.

I learned how to file the health and dental claims by learning UB's and HICFA's in order to file them. Management there was very nice and helpful in the begining but after being there for a while I relized that they were all in need of some more training because they couldn't even answer some of our questions on the processing part of the job. My co-workers were very enjoyable meet a lot of new people and made some great friends in the process.
good,"Very Interesting, exciting, never boring, coaching and development of employees"

good,Learned about US work culture and Guv benefits
good,Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Certificate
good,As long as you bring in the sales nobody bothers you in this high paced sales environment. The commissions were good and bonuses were better if you hit your sales targets. I was able to work from home on a regular basis however this also entails plenty of long nights and weekends to close deals.
good,"A typical day starts at 6:00 am where I would reconcile accounts for large companies in the areas of AP Trade and other accrued expenses. I've had the opportunity to learn about applying accounting in the areas of aerospace engineering. I work with wonderful co-workers who are very team-oriented. The hardest part of the job was working 14 or 15 hour days, starting from 5:00 am until 7:00 pm.

I also answer the phone, pass on emails to the right person and take messages for the officers."
good,We work in a fast paced environment with many deadlines but the coworkers are helpful and will share knowledge.
good,"During my time with this company I have had the pleasure of working with some great people. While management is aware that the pay is well below market average, they try to reward those who put in the hard work and effort to do their jobs well. It is a good environment for those who have little experience and want to build up into leadership roles, but does come with the risk of career stagnancy in the call center world."
good,"Research and resolve participant benefit issues, assist with participant and client escalations as assigned, process daily letters, assist with International employee population benefit updates. This is the first position I have held in the Health and Welfare Benefits Administration field; it has been a great learning experience. The company has changed hands twice in the last three years, so there have been many changes in management. My co-workers have been wonderful in sharing their expertise and knowledge to assist me in being a more productive team member.

good,"Os dias eram agitados. Trabalhavamos com expedição de documentos bancário das agências do banco Mercantil do Brasil do em todo Brasil. A gerência era um pouco distante. Foi a melhor equipe de trabalho com quem ja trabalhei. A parte mais difícil era quando um documento importante extraviava e tinhamos que acha-lo de qualquer maneira, mesmo que este documento na tivesse passado em nossas mãos. Quando conseguiamos concluir nossos trabalhos sem problemas."
good,A typical day at work is usually intense.
good,Not the company it used to be. My last position was is a troubled account that was terribly mishandled. The people I worked with made the trouble bearable.
good,I enjoyed running the printer side of the house. I learned to co-manage while still doing the work myself.
good,A very busy place at times and a very dead place at other times. Needed to be self reliant and bring it upon yourself to stay busy at the slow times.
good,This is an excellent place to be if you are just graduating from college good exposure to working for a company.
good,If you are a company person then this is the job for you. Compensation for the required expectations is something that can be improved upon. There were great programs there to boost your career but there was a series of jumping through hoops to get there.
good,Xerox is a great place of employment and advancement opportunities.
good,"This company is great for people that are focused on results and driving sales. If you are competitive, you will fit in very well at this company."
good,My experience is with engineering ONLY - I can't speak for the sales or services sectors.
good,I was a mail clerk through a temp agency working for Xerox. The job itself was quite challenging and at times pretty mundane. Overall if you want an easy job that can get a little tedious.
good,"The company has excellent benefits and good hours. The company overall has poor mangement and no room for advancement. I had to work there for 3 years, before I could receive any type of benefits."
good,"xerox company has low pay for college graduates. low acknowledgment for workers and a stickler type of company when it comes to hygiene. Makes workers feel bad and then everyone in the whole company know about who smells. So, the immaturity level is very high."
good,It was a great place to work for. Good managers and people. Since I left there was some re-structuring of the business to be more competitive in the printing business space.
good,"In terms of training and guidance Xerox is well known for its investment in its employees"
good,"This was a pretty easy job, but the pay was to low to support a family on. I would have stayed for more money.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with the people."
good,"The people and the place wasn't bad in the least, they worked with you as much as they could to get you the hours you needed and fit your schedule if you had school. The only that really made the job bad was that it was customer care over the phone and that takes a certain kind of person. Was fine until the entire center went to Retention Department only."
good,"Being available for phone, and email support meant there was no real time for team building sessions."
good,I maintained a contract of 165 printers.  I was not paid a fare wage. I stayed with the company hoping to oneday be compensated for my skill.  I was not.
good,I worked here with the assumption that I would be able to move up however that was not the case they have a very high turnover rate and do not hold up there end of the bargain.
good,Not for everyone. paid by the number of calls you took. restrictive if personal functions where needed. clean safe office environment. Bad break room. good IT

good,Xerox was one of the best opportunity to grow and show your skills. Learned new technical skills about  automated software testing environment. Daily tests of new software builds.
good,"The people were  great, the atmosphere, ok was decent. However the pay could have been better, the the rewards could have been better as well. I would recommend working there, but not if you have the drive to do more."
good,The typical workday is structured and closely monitored to ensure work coverage and center metrics are met. The workplace culture is very laid back. The hardest part was changed or no breaks at times. The most enjoyable past was the satisfied members with one call resolutions.
good,"Good place to work.  Good work, life balance.  Salaries can be more competitive.  Decent benefits, but rather expensive. There is opportunity for advancement."
good,I was offered a promotion to supervisor- for nine months I had all the responsibilities of a supervisor but was never given my offer letter or pay raise.
good,Xerox was a good company to work for but not enough advancement opportunities. Not enough raises or work incentives. Would love to work for them again if given the opportunity.
good,"Overall, it was a good place to work. Strong peer orientated atmosphere. You were empowerment to run and management your business as it was your own business."
good,It was nice to work in multiple shifts.Saturday and sunday off was a plus point to work there and the over time rate for per hour was very good it was nice.
good,"Typical work day-High volume calls."
good,"the job I had was a relaxed environment, management was easy to get long with. the pay was good but other areas were not like the one I was in, this job no longer can be done at this location"
good,"I liked my job but didn't pay very will, constant changes in the way we processed paperwork  Too many cut throat individuals, suppose to work as a team but certain individuals were stabbing others in the back, running to mgt to tell on someone else."
good,I learned various skills at Xerox including how to be a leader and how to treat people. I was there for 38 years  in Customer Administration and held several management positions including Compliance Officer. The hardest part of my job was seeing the company downsize and being apart of that process as we lost so many highly skilled and dedicated employees.
good,"ambiente saudavel com pessoas interessantes, possibilidade de crescimento profissional"
good,"good place but behind the times in infrastructure, bit of an old boys club, lots of people there too long not doing much, but friendly enough, would work there again"

good,"inbound call center for Verizon. you help trouble shoot phones and also review the phone bills, add lines, offer promotions, set up new accounts and offer promotions."
good,"Empresa agradável, porém sem possibilidade de efetivação e salário baixo."
good,They made it as fun as they could and were very supportive of their CSRs. The down side was the mandatory overtime everyday. It became too much. Sometimes you would come in and find out you have overtime that evening.
good,"Disconnect between what our clients wanted from us as an organization and what Xerox was offering in return.  After a full take over of the BPO business by Xerox, we lost many long term, historical clients to competitors."
good,j'ai travaillé dans plusieurs régions du Québec 
good,"A typical day would consist of the following duties,"
good,"Làm việc tại công ty học hỏi được rất nhiều về các mảng máy tính"
good,"The work was versatile and interesting. Very good management and was able to learn more about processing to advance in my career. However, was given short notice that the contract was not being renewed and was not counting on leaving job."
good,Challenging global environment.  Working with OC customer and developing an A-rated team was the most rewarding part of the job.  Limited global resources reach.
good,"I worked at Xerox full-time"
good,"The management is great and extremely flexible, which is helpful when you have a family.  Unfortunately, the company is not focusing on RD&E, so there is not enough man power for innovation."
good,"My typical work day - Busy!"
good,"En typisk dag på arbejdet kravet at medarbejderne havde møde hver morgen og resten af dagen arbejdet man med et Health Care Program fra Californien på computeren. Programmet gav medarbejderne nogle forkellige documenter som havde fejl i dem som vi skulle korriger (via nogle forskellig koder fra en database). Jeg havde ansvar for nogle forskellig documenter hverdag og arbejdet på at for fixet alle fejlene. Da jeg sluttede min arbejds period på Xerox, var jeg meget tilfreds med min tid som medarbejder på Xerox men jeg var os klar til at begynd på nogle det krævet lidt mere innovation og intellektuelle potential."
good,"Xerox Canada, business process outsource division."
good,Xerox is a excellent place to work if you can Handel a corporate environment and micro management. Most people that work at Xerox stay at Xerox.  The average employe has been their for 12 years.
good,"Excellent company, detailed training, low job security. Pay is average and opportunities to earn commission is limited by those who you are aligned with. Did not feel I was presented with an accurate portrayal of earnings opportunity when I signed on for the job."
good,"Benefits and pay are excellent if you like being confined to a chair all day. During slow seasons; the holidays, they send you home if there is no work. They grade you on calls based on the ones they randomly (???) pick out. Their grading system is not fair or logical for their employees or their customers. Management is more concerned with getting their ideas implemented for their advancement than the well-fare of the customers.  I got tired of the games. The money wasn't worth what you had to go thru."
good,run faster faster faster til you drop. you never know in which direction the company is going. spent 30 years and watched it go down in so many ways. one day its over
good,"Meet with CEO or purchasing manager for new document management systems. Very fast environment, but also educative. Learn how to methodically work. Very tough to meet the objectives, as the monthly budget had to be with accuracy of +-10%."
good,"After a long tenure, I was let go in a large downsize where my division was cut and the rest had to pick up the pieces.  More with less they always stated.  Wish them success."
good,Xerox which is now Conduent was definitely an experience.  The workplace was relaxed and everything was pretty much redundant. Dealing with clients and contract requirements and payment processing.
good,"Xerox was like one big double elimination tournament. My last 2 years I had excellent managers. It was simply a company that did not have enough revenue. I learned if you want to grow you better take the bull by the horns and make your own opportunities. "
good,Very disappointed with the lack of corporate loyalty towards employees.  Leaders talk about promoting a new transparent environment but failed.  Several recent employees blindsided by involuntary reduction of force.  Disappointed and devastating.
good,"Transaction Processor and Subject Matter Expert (SME), At the initial level I have to listen the pre- recorded utterances of various clients (i.e. samsung, windstream, leasehawk, TXU etc) customers and respond accorndingly on a software named IAD. After 1 month I was promoted to SME on the basis of my accuracy in which I have to explain the new recruited employees about the process and help at their initial level."
good,"Great people to work with. Working in a small department felt like having a second family. A fast paced environment, with long hours at month-ends. Sadly, the company is set-up on restructuring in Canada."
good,"Little to no room for advancement, lots of opportunities to work more hours and make more money if you meet your quotas, occasional mandatory overtime with lots of opportunities for selective overtime, nice break room, decent smoking cage, decent parking, decent benefits, great salary for the area not including bonuses."
good,"continuous calls, very often, there is no break between calls. learnt to maintain calm, make note while on the calls, management very helpful, good workplace culture, hardest part was to handle unsatisfied and frustrated customers. The most satisfying part of the jobs was being able to resolve problems faced by customers and  receiving positive surveys from them."
good,"As a customer support representative, you are used to changes on the job and learning quickly. You must have integrity and knowledge on the company you work for."
good,"I worked for xerox by way of Adecco, and after over a year of employment things went south fast. I was in a small group of individuals here that were expected to get hired on full time and xerox announced nationwide cuts and office closures. The office we were in was closed, everyone was either fired, dismissed or laid off."
good,good place to work. Company needs to concentrate on selling equipment. I saw a lack of sales. Too much automation on the service side. Need to get back to the personal touch.
good,Good company that is always busy and has a lot of hours to work if your wanting to work over time. . Management doesn't have that much communications with employees. .
good,La empresa te permite tener un muy buen balance de vida y tiene buenos beneficios. El ambiente laboral no es tan bueno como pudiera ser.
good,"At one time, this was a flourishing company with solid leadership, great work life balance, sound ethics and excellent potential for growth. Unfortunately, each time the company goes through a corporate takeover, more and more of that culture disappears. The most recent move to Conduent has turned what was a great warm & inspiring culture into a cold, sterile environment with cuts to benefits, pay and the core leadership. If a great leader hasn't already left on their own, seeing the signs on the wall, they are being laid off left and right with no succession plan in place which is leading to more chaos. "
good,"Within the time working in Xerox company I valued and cherished every moments experienced, from my teammates to every calls received within the day. I learned how to build such confidence in dealing with an irate calls which was inevitable to a call center agent. In consequence, it develops my personality and uphold everything I adopted with the company and to perform more with the next job opportunity to come."
good,friendly and approachable co-representatives and Team leaders. The work place is not stressful. It was a fun experience staying at Xerox. HR staff are very friendly

good,"Since my employment in Xerox was  in the BPO business that was spun off, I am not able to give review of the remaining business. Past consolidations and acquisitions created pockets of employees who had different benefits, culture, etc."
good,Xerox is highly flexible and allows for work/life balance. Allows for virtual and office options (some jobs may require office hours). Pay rate is optimal for the Rochester Area.
good,Took inbound calls from sprint members .This was my first call center job so i am thankful for the experience..Is a great place to get started at cause they will hire anyone
good,"Xerox is a company that outsources to many other companies. For this review it's referring to their outsource to Verizon Wireless. Your daily work life consist of help out customers with their cellphone needs. Whether that's helping with billing questions, to upgrades to new lines of service. Your workload consist of about 50-60 calls a day from across the country. The upper management is great and your supervisor is a great source of help. They make sure their employees keep up to date with training to help understand new promotions or changes that are coming up."
good,When I started the training was excellent. My trainer was very confident and educated. I miss her. Also my training class became very close. There was rarely any drama.
good,"Conduent (formerly Xerox) has great people and managers. Compensation isn't the best, but you will gain a lot of experience in health and insurance as well as pension administration benefits."
good,if you're looking for somewhere to get a steady pay check than this is the place for you. definitely not a career place because the pay is really horrible and they do not give raises ever.
good,"Ok place to work. You will have  to type fast and  be quick on calls if you want to make money. This place, you get paid based on how many calls you take in a day."
good,"Ótimo ambiente de trabalho, com uma boa interação com a equipe se ajudando, ensinando e aprendendo dependendo da situação."
good,"Like the title says very long hours. The people that you work with are great, the calls on the other hand not so much. If you like answering billing questions and finding remedies then this might just be the job for you."
good,"The job itself was easy to manage. "
good,"I enjoyed working with Xerox however the pay was low for the services provided for the customers.  Gained the ability to assist customers in services, sales, and order review for orders placed online."
good,"it was decent job before it was split into conduent. typical day was sitting there, assisting customers who were having issues with medicare. so being yelled at a lot by angry customers all day but it was very satisfactory when the customers went from super angry, to you making their whole week by not only fixing their issues but when you treated them like people so it made up for the hardships of that. over all it was a decent workplace to be in"
good,"Productiewerk in een grooooote fabriek."
good,"Once in a year we have a culture day"
good,"Great place to sell in a very competitive industry. Typical day involves account management, generating proposals, building business cases, prospecting, pipeline management, opportunity validation, meeting with customers."
good,"Working for xerox was ok because you always get your full 40 hours a week and usually can have unlimited overtime. Is very fast paced, management was alright. Best part of working there is talking to people all around the world worst thing about working there is that rules could have been much more enforced and would have created a better work experience."
good,"The environment for which you work in is loud, always busy, many people walking by and people talking around you. There is a big diversity group which is great different kinds of people fun environment is to work well with co-workers."
good,Xerox in Kochi really a good location to work and the people are really good.One will get meal coupon and transportation in addition to monthly bonus.
good,"The day was spent on the telephone; Helping out customers. I learned so much about the FCC, Television networking, video hook ups and how to fix connection problems. The management was great. Xerox was all about maintain its contract with the cable company. Hardest part was having to sit and accept racist and discriminatory language. Most enjoyable part was the team effort and help. The only other bothersome issue was the abuse of overtime laws and regulations. You were expected to stay if needed for X amount of time on any given day and even had some of your days off taken to come to work but then have a 3 hour lunch and a 45 minute break off the clock."
good,"C'est une entreprise ou la routine ne s'installe pas , les journées sont très prenantes et diversifiées."
good,A typical day at work involved what time of the month it was.  I was given time by my manager to complete my schedules as they were due.  The culture was something I was not I was excited about.  Overall management was great.  The hardest part of the job was giving presentations but I have greatly improved in that area.  The most enjoyable part were time when were quiet and we had all of our schedules finished and approved.
good,A typical day at work starts with a meeting base on the past day work accomplishments and outstanding situation.What you learned fro this is to discuss it with your technical team to solve the outstanding issues arises to immediately solve the problem to avoid consequential problems that will branch out from it.
good,Great company to work for with good opportunity to advance if you put time and effort into it. A good calm environment to work in with great upper management.
good,they just done care about what you do . Very much like a high school environment. Get to do whatever you want. Not professional at all. Pay and incentives were good
good,"High customer services values."
good,Xerox moves at a very slow pace with regards to innovation. Managers are absolutely some of the best part about having worked here. Brand recognition is a positive but also a negative. The company is taking a direction that seems to be outsourcing sales to smaller organizations and reducing sales force.
good,"There were some major issues with the transition of our call center, but things did improve over the course of time, still not great, but better."
good,Working at Xerox allowed me to learn a lot of communication skills that I used both in and out of work. I learned how to work with the customer in resolving the issues and problems that they would call in for in a professional matter.
good,"Hoewel het bedrijf in Istanbul was gevestigd, werkten er ontzettend veel mensen uit Nederland, Duitsland en Frankrijk. Men voelt zich binnen dit bedrijf wel thuis."
good,Xerox Turkey is like a relaxation place than a work place. Colleagues are really old and management is not so good. The hardest part is to cope with lazy colleagues.
good,Just like what I have said about Concentrix buying all the shares of IBM Everything Changes and all is not good and Harmonization is not that we expect happened Low Income Low Health care benefits.
good,"Mid level Team Leaders does not have good product knowledge & market information to value add to the company, hence, many opportunities are lost."
good,"Very stressful job with option to get promoted. Depending on what area you live in you will be working for different companies, which means different rules and policies. Corporate loves to change schedules without even warning the managers. Benefits are a joke. Absolute bare minimum benefits that is too expensive to actually use."
good,I love the atmosphere. It is a place you can learn and not be afraid of asking for help. I have enjoyed the things I have learned and experienced with this company.
good,"The Xerox Customer Service Center was busy from early morning to early evening.  Calls were received which needed to be handled from a customer stand point.  I learned that the company hired anyone regardless if they were qualified.  I learned to ask assistance from surrounding co-workers instead of the trainers/evaluator, and read from a script provided. Their were many great co-workers who had years of knowledge to the system we were providing support for, Some of the Management was biased and would talk down to employees harshly.  Some employees would be reprimanded for doing something their 'pets' would do.  Management did refer the favorites as 'pets. The hardest part of the job was working with the biased management. The enjoyable part was knowing their were a lot of great people working there that shared their knowledge."
good,"schedules always changing without notice, fleas and bed bugs infest the call floor,nobody ever knows whats going on, training is irrelavent to work field"
good,"The company could have been a great place , but to many young Supervisor with no experience or cares in the world were leader. With out training in order to train. To many friends and family working together so we all had to pay the price for the hand full that did not care it was only a free pay check to the. Upper management were to close to them to correct them. So a lost of contract hurts everyone."
good,"My co-workers and immediate manager are great, but the management above my immediate manager is questionable.  It's difficult to truly understand the goals and the direction of the company.  The vision for the company is not clear which is very unfortunate.  This is a place from which I could have seen myself retiring if the vision and the pay had been better."
good,"buen ambiente,poner en orden pedidos darle seguimiento al cliente,la direccion bien ,colegas bien ,parte dificil no tener material para surtir al cliente horario corrido y conocer personas."
good,"A typical work day is good. "
good,"A typical day at work can be stressful. I perform many job tasks each and every day. I am training customer service specialists, I also help with the development of Training Assistants and new Trainers. I am a payroll consultant for the entire training department. This is using Kronos and i'm responsible for the payroll of up to 120 separate employees. I am also responsible for training up to 30 learners in a 5 week period. I work very well with my co-workers and always make time to help to make sure they are being supported and providing them with best practices to make sure they are successful. The hardest part of my job is finding the time do all my work in an 8 hour work day. I love to grow and develop new learners."
good,"The pay is low compared to the market, but they make up for it with a great environment and focus on employee development."
good,overall satisfactory experience. great co workers and colleagues. Pay is okay. Great transitional job. Fast passed and sometimes intense requires focus
good,"multi-task, must meet deadlines and work under pressure. must be versatile, positive attitude, be to work on time, do not call in sick - have good work ethic."
good,They're very good at balancing their needs with the clients needs. Making everyone happy for the most part. Sometimes it overworks the Employees but they do try to compensate
good,"the people ruined it for me they where childish like school kids or something. All ways gossping and starting things up in the work environment, on top that traffic is terrible to get threw to & from work and don't make a simple mistake because its over if you do."
good,"Typically this job can be very frustrating dealing with customers over the phone. This job is a performance based job, but overall your judged on if the customer was happy and their issue is resolved. At times the customer is not going to like what you tell them based on our criteria, but  you basically get the blame for it. But co-workers are friendly. Not really a clean working environment. You basically have to bring your own cleaning supplies to work to wipe off the desks because their are no assigned seats. Overall the environment feels like high school...its a good job to have if your searching for another job waiting for a better opportunity to come"
good,"* Je hebt een planning wat je die dag wilt doen maar door storingen of problemen aan installaties wil dit nog wel eens anders verlopen."
good,"I had been here for more than 2 and half years. "
good,because of the type of service that is provided call types could change some time from month to month. some calls are always the same but there is always a new issue that ends up happening
good,"Working at Xerox is not unlike working for any other major corporation, the focus is on the bottom, however, Xerox does seem to be placing some emphasis on employees of late. We've seen salary increases, some improvement to benefits, more employee discounts and a willingness to promote from within. Overall Xerox is not a bad place to work and if you have the credentials, opportunities are available for those willing to relocate not only within in the boundaries of the United States but globally. Lots of opportunities for those willing to take a chance."
good,"As a CSR, I enjoyed assisting customers with account and technical issues.  My team was great and so was management."
good,I was the Learning and Development Training Manager. It was a growth experience working at Xerox. It was definitely a new experience.
good,Started great with this company. made friends and upbeat workplace. Of course the company has certain goals. not meeting the numbers means losing a contract with our client. and losing a contract with our client means losing your job. The company is goal oriented and driven by numbers.
good,"Hi..."
good,"It is a call center so you sit all day, however they have a good break setup also decent benefits and decent people working there. The only thing that I really didn't like is that the bonus depending on the  team if you get it or not."
good,"Great work-life balance, but known for low compensation, especially right now with all of the changes taking place. Also, Xerox is going through a lot of lay-offs currently with the splitting of the company."
good,"The project I work on is overwhelming, but very rewarding. You may be under paid, but you will learn a lot. The right people are placed in your path to help you. There is too much work to do, and too little time to accomplish them."
good,"answer inbound calls, account management, write reports, training,  Spanish queue representative. process violations images, fax, copy, file, process payments."
good,Overall they tried to maintain a balance of friendship and hardwork. I worked as a project based employee before becoming a full-time employee. The only problem I had is that they changed the rules on what was to be keyed and what wasn't too often so you had trouble achieving you quality rating you had to maintain.
good,A typical day is answering phone calls and talking to your co-worker in the next cubicle next to you. I learned how to calm angry customer and help them.
good,"Tout le travail que j'ai accomplit me plaisait, le personnel de la compagnie CGI était agréable a côtoyé tout les jour."
good,"My typical day involved taking calls from providers to review the claims they submitted to Medicaid for payment. I learned patience, and gained knowledge on the workings of the healthcare industry. My coworkers were amazing and they were the most enjoyable part of what was a very stressful job. The hardest part of the job was the stress."
good,"The benefits could be better, the pay is based off an abc pay system so you make what you produce not hourly. Keying all day and it starts to effect arms and shoulders, Very flexible on breaks and lunch if your a transaction processor"
good,"Starting the day with the inspire of learning and giving for my day and always open for harder and more focused career to get the best of out of such working day."
good,The work at Xerox is always changing and can cause frustration and training is lacking. The management is poorly organized and tend to be selfish. Its not a bad job but its not for everyone.
good,The hardest part of this job is paying attention to details. I enjoy taking part in helping save lives. My decisions and focus are very important.
good,"These is place i have learned a lot about the work and about people management"
good,Received 50 to 100 inbound calls. Learned more about customer service and how to multitask better. Management was great. Co-workers friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was when systems went down. Enjoyable part was helping the customer.
good,"When I first started with Xerox a typical day would entail traveling in a vehicle to pick up parts and attend customers after a breakdown had been recorded."
good,"Good place to work, however, the achievement based compensation (ABC) program is awful for employee salaries."
good,was a relaxed environment and you get to meet many new people. Xerox was a place that you had to make sure you met your goals. Everyone was very caring and nice and would help you if your needed help.
good,"unable to leave desk unless on structured breaks. Received incoming customer service calls. It was all about the numbers. You as a person ,did not matter."
good,Its sad that the year of cradle to grave have gone away.. Its not just Xerox thought.. The days when management cared about the employees and the employees cared enough to go that extra mile are gone.
good,"I love my job, I love the people I work with.  However, this type of work is notorious for low pay and not a lot of growth within the company."
good,dealing with elderly concerning insurance coverage and explaining how they were in a certain part of their coverage wherein they were paying almost 100% of their drug coverage.
good,"The pros and cons to this Transaction Processor position are fairly normal as any other job. I would only recommend this job to those who are able to work from home, type with haste and accuracy, and doesn't need sick time, or much expectancy to move up from this position. The faster you type with high accuracy, the more money you make on a daily basis."
good,Xerox is a interesting place to work.  Knew things are learned each day and you never know what you may find during daily investigations
good,Lavorare in una grane azienda è sicuramente stimolante e da una formazione che raramente è possibile raggiungere in realtà piccole. Corsi di formazione aggiornamenti contatti sia con colleghi che con clientela
good,"Confer with customers by telephone or in person to provide information about products or services, take or enter orders, cancel accounts, or obtain details of complaints. Keep records of customer interactions or transactions, recording details of inquiries, complaints, or comments, as well as actions taken."
good,"This was a great company. I felt like I was finally at a job where I came to work and as long as I did my work, everything was good. I had a great supervisor, which rarely happens and as far as I knew, there was no drama. Then the dreaded day happened when they merged with Xerox and EVERYTHING changed. The whole process of my job changed and with that the company seemed like there was a dark cloud over it because now there was backbiting between supervision and employee, my supervisor changed and all of a sudden, I felt like it was time to leave due to the fact that management was making promises that they didn't intend to keep and the days just started to get long and hard."
good,"Erg leuke collega`s!"
good,The pay is not bad but the incentives and bonuses help. The staff is friendly but not very helpful outside of training. The hours are somewhat crazy and breaks are limited.
good,Xerox site manager was not involved with the employees. Basically absent. Work at CCHHS at times very hectic but enjoyable. The environment was not like that of structured corporate America. Learning about the Healthcare industry was very enjoyable.
good,"The paid training and benefits are probably the best parts about this job. Co-workers and higher ups were also very helpful and nice. The only problem is once training is over, it feels like you've been thrown into shark infested water. Like you've been training in a baby swimming pool and suddenly they drop you into the ocean to be ripped apart by blood-thirst sharks. The calls are high volume and your breaks will feel short. It's call after call, you don't get much breather time in between."
good,The work environment was a fast pace environment. The management team was very helpful. Sometimes it would be very intense when the calls were coming in back to back. There was always a subject matter expert there to help out on any call that needed an experts assistance.
good,"the hardest part of working at Xerox is dealing with uposet customers you can make every one happy"
good,Not only a Data Entry position but a Research and a great introduction to learning about healthcare benefits. What I learned about the position is that I have obstacles that can easily be solved by managerial or co-worker's assistance or advice but the most difficult is to meet the daily quantity of completion of application based on weekly updates and regulations.
good,"Xerox is an upbeat work environment, majority of the people are very friendly and helpful. Although as a work place it is very unorganized and the training classes don't help much when you get on the call floor, they change rules on you nearly daily. I left the company because they accidentally terminated me and it took almost an entire month to pay me for the week they got incorrect, also they didn't pay me my regular biweekly check because of system issues, therefore, I fell behind on my bill payments and couldn't afford my daily essentials."
good,"freedom at work and easily access with management  and friendly atmosphere with the team members and team leaders."
good,"Working in a call center for a government healthcare program is extremely stressful.  Many of the customers are dissatisfied with the bureaucracy and they take their frustrations out of the representatives, who are expected to remain cheery and provide world class customer service.  "
good,A typical day at work xerox is very busy. The management is okay. My co-workers are sometimes very helpful. The hardest part of the job is trying to satisfy and angry customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy and when they are thanking me for helping and taking my time.
good,Being able to deal with customers respectfully and efficiently. I enjoy being able to make a difference and  motivate others.  Being able to lend a helping hand to any one is just a huge part of my individuality
good,Every day was a new experience that prepared you for what was to come. The training was great and much needed and management was there to help every step of the way. There was a lot of good people that made the experience so much better. Learning more about computers and people every day helped better myself as a person. The hardest part was keeping up the standards and expectations. Once behind it was hard to catch up. Trainers were the part of the job I liked the most. They helped out as much as possible and even gave individual attention. Also making you fell part of the family from the beginning
good,"Was a customer service Rep answering incoming calls, I learned a lot about Medicare plans. Management was very helpful and dependable. It was great working with most of my co-workers, they were very knowledgeable of the product and services.  I was say the hardest part is making sure that you know your product and being very accurate on what you are sharing with the customers. I was able to speak to some amazing people from all walks of life."
good,"A solid job for a younger, fresh out of college graduate type employee. Wouldn't want this as a career for anybody. Its been largely supported that shift work is bad for your health, especially in combination with a dusty chemical filled environment. This job leaves most people looking for work elsewhere withing a few months (or less)."
good,I loved to work there because I loved the culture and I loved the people. but I did not like the way the company was ran. they was considerable favoritism and little to no wage increases
good,wish senior management understood the difference between business development and sales and do not address their go-to-market in such a silo'd approach
good,working at Xerox has helped me with several things it has enhanced my typing capabilities as well as my  ability to maneuver through many web pages at onetime Xerox has also strengthen my ability to multi task with hearing a customers issues while assessing the account for other errors. My listening skills also have enhanced  helping me to be able to sense customers moods and emotions by there tone. the most fun part of my job I would say is being able to speak with and relate to  so many people from all different sides of the country  I love when I get that one customer who calls in frustrated beyond belief and ends the call happy and understanding. The least thing I like about my job is the pay it is way to inconsistent ranging from 9.50-13.50 based off  the difference of one failed survey u receive from a customer out of a month of daily passing surveys it is simply devastating on my paychecks I feel over worked and underpaid also the management I feel are careless at times my position at Xerox is a customer service rep I speak to many customers with several different types of issues from billing discrepancies to troubleshooting their devices to placing orders our supervisors are suppose to be our relief and comfort with escalated and complex accounts  however if the headset is not on there head it is joke causing us as the reps to become drained and burnt out
good,"This is a tough job. You work a lot of hours, answer hundreds of calls, and are expected to continually meet certain metrics. Though I personally found those metrics to be a bit on the high side, I can understand why they were asked for. It takes a special person to survive at this job for any length of time."
good,"Enjoyed work itself but job insecurity. Struggling to get better with the healthcare business. No raises, no encouragement about career advancement or even how you are doing in your present job. Always a threat that some people may have to be let go - totally nerve wrecking."
good,"TMS has a very friendly environment."
good,Great place to learn.   Need some help on communication between silo'd departments.  All in all it is a great place to work with a family in the background.
good,"A typical day was too long, very stressful atmosphere. Not a place that I would recommend. too many competitors, dealing with co workers was unfair. The programs could have been run better. Training by better personal, knowing their job efficiently."
good,What was once a blue chip company is now being run by a middle management team who have never worked at the coal face and have no idea of the impact their decisions have on the ability of the service force to do the job.Such a shame.
good,"good work/life balance;"
good,I have found my work experience with Xerox to be rewarding. I have been able to advance my career and received tuition reimbursement to advance my career.
good,Dealing with members the second I walk through the door and I love being able to make somebodys day by helping them out in the best possible way that I can.
good,"A typical day was answering phones handling calls with professionalism trying to resolve member issues and assist fellow agents if necessary. "
good,This was a faced paced environment but the job in customer service was very rewarding due to the many members it provided service to.
good,"this is an o.k. job  for padding your resume. overall, this is not a position that you would want to maintain up to retirement. if you begin working here you will either A)quit within twelve months B)move to senior agent within twelve months then quit or C) be absolutely in love with the potential for promotion and show active interest and seek to rise in this branch of the company. good luck in any case, they will give almost anyone a chance."
good,"A typical day at Xerox was performing multi tasks. Responsible for meeting turnaround, quality of customer. Also completed and performed Performance Reviews on employees.  Did brainstorming to achieve efficient ways to perform our jobs.  Also responsible for selecting type of job to have employee perform at their best potential. Really learned to use time management well to complete daily agenda."
good,"Op pad met de bedrijfsauto bij diverse klanten langs om reparaties en modificaties uit te voeren."
good,"Working for Xerox, I learned many ways to expand my knowledge of computer technology in short periods of time, which I still carry with me considering I use computers more today than I ever did before. Many of my co-workers were very pleasant to talk to allowing breaks and lunches to be extremely more relaxed throughout a stressful day taking phone calls from frustrated customers. Starting, my manager was excellent and expanded my knowledge of the necessary tasks and programs as well as communications exponentially. My floor manager did not posess the same form of optimism and was neglectant to show knew employees attention for their needs causing wages to drop due to bad call ratios. This made the job very difficult considering each person has to learn on their own what they need to do to satisfy a customer in order to get better call ratios resulting in better pay as well as resulting in worse customer service quality due to possible errors later caused from lack of know how which is the direct result of supervisors not informing their team and keeping them updated on all need to know information. I enjoyed the customers most about this job. I have been on the customer side and know what it is like to be frustrated, which is how I learned no matter the customers frustration when they call in, as long as you are able to calm them down you have a good chance to have a decently pleasant conversation with average people. Most customers understand that it is not the representative's fault for their problems and that they are there to help, with a little patients customers, though"
good,"Good managers."
good,Day to day I would help customers with any need they had. They had good training on it for 7 weeks before you started the job.
good,"It was a good paying job. I never knew what hours I was going to work, however. The management wasn't the best in the world. The job itself was easy and good paying, however."
good,"This is a fast paced environment which enables the workers to view the entire printing process, from start to finish, resulting in providing the clients with high quality printed materials, as needed. The coworkers feel a personal sense of pride in completing these materials, and aim to meet and exceed client expectations on a daily basis. Since this is a print on demand facility, deadlines can sometimes be very tight, especially during peak, high volume periods, so the ability to work quickly and accurately, is crucial to the overall success of the team."
good,"If you want to have a full time+ job, this is a great option. They already want you to work 5 hours of overtime per month,  and if you want to have more hours, they're yours, as long as you don't work more than 12 hours per day. You get benefits, and often there are incentive programs. If you are great with people and are difficult to anger, you'll do very well. There isn't much in the way of help though, often supervisors will avoid you if you are a representative who likes to make sure that the information you're giving is correct, because sometimes the wording of resources leave gaps. And if you don't double-check because a supervisor chastises you for asking too many questions and you mess up, it's all on you. Not to say there aren't awesome supervisors that I'd like to emulate, but there aren't enough of them."
good,"As tarefas eram realizadas de forma tranquila e progressiva, mediante o trabalho em equipe."
good,It is enjoyable working for Xerox. I had the opportunity to work in teams with bright critical thinkers and individuals from diverse backgrounds. The most enjoyable and rewarding part of the job was working on challenging projects and building relationships with my customers.
good,Xerox is a good pace to learn and gain customer service experience. I have leaned a lot of health insurance information from working there. Management need to work on there professionalism as well as co-workers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with co-workers who cant  remain professional. The most enjoyable part is solving the customers problems and gaining knowledge and experience in the health field.

good,"Team environment, willing to help each other and grow professionally"
good,Great environment to work in...very professional and friendly environment.
good,A great place to learn about vendor relations. Flexibility is a must.
good,"Although it was a relaxed and comfortable place to be employed the hours are hard to cope with and a few of the leaders take advantage of their privileges,  Defiantly not a place for a single mom who is restricted by daycare to work."
good,Great work experience. very active environment. A  typical day at work is about 40-60 inbound calls. Management does need improvement but overall its good.
good,was a fun place to work but the hardest to get help when you run into a family emergency .I love talking to my customers and my co-workers were great
good,Amazing people to work with.  Sales department is in transition and needs to adapt to a more mature and seasoned sales team.
good,"Lead the IT services and product sourcing process (Software focus), from identification of emerging markets and potential suppliers, clarifying requirements, facilitating vendor request for proposal I evaluation I selection steps, negotiating and contracting agreements (multiple levels of contracts), facilitating ongoing vendor sourcing governance, interacts with Executive and management within Xerox and the Vendor's organization, identifies opportunities for business improvement."
good,Processing financial statements. Co-workers were enjoyable.
good,"Xerox is the industry leader in services, and has a great lineup of products. if you can work through the internal systems, which are impossible for anyone to navigate smoothly, the job would be quite pleasant. anyone who has been there any extended amount of time, is pretty jaded about the company, which doesnt make for the best office environment."
good,"It is a good company to work in. What you earn is up to you, you get paid according to the number of transactions you complete."
good,"Very tedious and repetitive which makes for a long day.  Management is decent, lacking in communication.  Hardest part of the job is boredom."
good,"Call center friendly environment, taking inbound calls between 130pm - 11pm. Researching questions for customers such as phone bills, activations, plan changes, phone upgrades, etc."
good,The Xerox brand name became bigger than the company's attributes.
good,"desarrolle mas mi habilidad administrativa,buena relasion entre los empleados"
good,"The pay is good for the first 90 days. After that you go into whats called ""ABC"" pay which allows the to change your hourly pay based on your performance. If you taking a lot of calls and not failing ANY of your 3 surveys a day then your pay will stay the same, and if continued it will rise. But if you fail even 1 survey you get paid 30 cents less for the next 30 days. The management all look out for themselves and aren't loyal to you. But your surrounding co-workers help you through it and makes it easier to stick around until you find something better. Though they also have drawings every month and the workers get prizes like tvs and game systems."
good,"Xerox is a great entry level position job, but as an adult with children, I desire a job with potential to grow with more pay and better benefits. I enjoy helping people on a daily basis and working in the fast paced environment."
good,"The day starts with daily calls and learned some new technologies ."
good,"ome very smart people are trying to make things better."
good,"Als u wil weten hoe mijn werkdag eruit ziet, wil ik u dat graag in een mondeling gesprek toelichten. Tevens de omgang met collega's."
good,"Its a job i can say, but sitting down doesn't make it an easy one. The calls sometimes are high ranged & can have you boiling. Sometimes you will have nice members that call & other times you will have very rude members. I can deal with it because i know its just over the phone & you have to stay positive even when you're being chewed out & isn't in the wrong. The management there could be better."
good,There is a lot of confusion in this work area on which contract is extending or ending but a fun workplace.
good,"I worked in the call center taking inbound calls for a client. Training was paid and very in-depth in a classroom setting. My coworkers were all amazing and extremely helpful, the night shift was very relaxed compared to the mornings. Management is a mess though, I was on the production floor for a month and a half and my team and I didn't have our own supervisor so we relied heavily on each other for difficult calls. There were also days where people would be asked to go home without pay because of a shortage of spaces to sit. Overall I enjoyed my time with Xerox, some days I wish I'd never left, but not having a supervisor hurt my productivity because I wasn't receiving any other training on what I was doing wrong or right with my calls, or other techniques."

good,Xerox is a great place to start if your wanting to get into banking. The training is long but their is so much to learn that the 7 weeks training class is not long enough. They need more time to train their employees. But other than that good place to work. Alot of room for advancement in this company.
good,"taking calls from all over the us."
good,Taking non-stop calls to help members with their health insurance. I've learned much patients and great people skills to get anyone to calm down and accept reasonable things. The hardest part of my job was the call volume. The greatest part of the job was actually helping people who needed a patient and kind reassuring voice.
good,A typical day at work is cold. You freeze constantly. I have learned a lot about data entry. The hardest part of the job is the constant change in health care plans.
good,"I would be busy from the time I started until the end of the day.  The work environment was relaxed and the people were easy to get along with, it was like a big family."
good,"Development growth is key to a successful business.  Xerox brings a very strong development program through effective product, service and sale training.  "
good,"I worked multiple positions, including management. From that perspective I can say that unfortunately the business runs people as numbers. But it's a call center, so go figure. "
good,Productive and fun workplace. Got opportunity and learned a lot from work.
good,Call center type of environment which I didnt mind and co-workers that made you feel comfortable. Manangement was absent and not educated with the questions and concerns employees had.  A lot of changes occurred to often leading to many let go's due to incomplete information needed to learn. The hardest part of the job would be the inability to intake new but not thorough information and trying to deal with the customers while theres no management around. The most enjoyable part of the job would be satisfying customer needs.
good,"Not a bad place to work but the pay rate can be better. no advancement if you wish to obtain in the future. People are good to work with but there is no sense of any security if hired on as contract, which will cause many to move on. works best for students IMO."
good,I enjoy working for Xerox. Over all the Staff including Management and Supervisors are amazing. Unfortunatley the pay is not great. Other than that I really do like the company's goals and standards.
good,"Great supportive office.  Would love to work directly for Deloitte, but contracted for Xerox with no advancement opputunities."
good,ok place to work coworkers are fun 40 hours a week pay is okgffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
good,A typical day was learning everything there is to know about the job. There will be a long 7 week training. I learned new things about phones and tablets that I didn't know about. The co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job would be the long training process. The enjoyable part would be you get to meet new people everyday. There is over 1000 employees.
good,"A empresa demonstra ser um bom local de trabalho, flexível com horários e demanda, humanizada devido sua gerência/direção."
good,Productive and several long term employees.  Stressful job quotas and assigned tasks.
good,"It's a nice place to work, its not a complicated place to work."
good,"Het leukste is de diversiteit van de werkzaamheden. Verder is de sfeer aangenaam en informeel en zullen je je collega's al gauw kennissen of vrienden kunnen noemen. Ik heb hier geleerd hoe ik het beste uit mijzelf kan halen, goed kan functioneren in teamverband en misschien wel het belangrijkst: op welke wijze ik mijn ambitieswaar kan maken en mijzelf interne doorgroeimogelijkheden verschaf."
good,Xerox is overall a good company to work for. There are many advantages to working for the company. There are benefits offered and good management.
good,"Successfully transitioned Cash Application and Dealer Claims activity from Indonesia General Motors. Successfully migrate and settled Indonesia project."
good,I learned a lot about the corporate world and I was able to perform many task related to administration.
good,"come in and get the area set up for our agents to arrive, went over what to expect with the agents as well as how to deal with issues as well helped support the agents take calls as well as coaching the agents to make the better/more proficient at there job as well"
good,They always had overtime and I really liked that about the company.
good,"This company has great opportunity for growth. I have worked for this company for over two years, and although I love it. I am looking for a new begging with more advancement with in."
good,Working for Xerox was overall positive experience.  What started as a temporary job taking phone calls eventually turned into a 17+ year career as a systems analyst.  
good,"Great experience and nice place to work, but with the recent CEO, there is no more room to grow professionally in my field."
good,"Working in a call center requires a certain mindset.  High call volume is a given, and the nature of the tech support is always changing.  Combine the two, and you have a typical day at Xerox."
good,"Since  I have been under more than a few bosses thru my thirty five years at being a stock handler the ones that seemed the most successful seem to be those who can relate to the employees and keep moral up by just about anything that works. One year we had incentives to have as many perfect orders as possible and my family and I had such fun together, That summer we got movie tickets, sears gift cards, dinners at the Olive Garden ect. These perfect orders went on for over six months until that fatefullday when I forgot to put in an ordered dust cloth. Ouch that really hurt, IT WAS A GREAT SUMMER AND THE COMPANY REALLY ENJOYED THE STELLAR FEEDBACK FROM OUR CUSTOMERS,  "
good,A typical day at work is going aroud troubloeshooting service calls. I have learned that putting the customer first is the necessicity to success. Management needs to be upgraded. I have some good coworkers on our team. The hardest part of  the job is working by mylself and having to be the last line of defence when fixing a machine.The most enjoyable part of my job is driving aroud from account to account.
good,"Xerox is a decent company. There are a lot of hardworking colleagues here. "
good,Overall working for Xerox was a solid job in which you can make a very decent paycheck with the right amount of effort. The big downside to this job is that it is an extremely stressful work environment where you will continuously be screamed at and cussed out by customers due to management level decisions that you have to enforce. This companies management in no way looks out for its customers or its employees and is overall difficult to work for on the lower end of the food chain.
good,"Typical day at work for me would be to do the morning report and my call. Then start on my work for the day. Typical day for most would be taking about 80-100 phone calls a day. I learned to be patient and calm with customers and to always be helpful. I learned leadership qualities and how to help others on a daily basis. Management was consistent, not much change. Co-workers were mostly easy going people. Hardest part of the job would be trying to accomadate for everyones needs. Most enjoyable part was being able to fix a problem for a member."
good,Great Co-workers to work with. Everyone is willing to help and support each other.
good,Xerox is a very fast paced environment with very tight deadlines.
good,stay on the phones your entire shift. working here was a good stepping stone but it is not somewhere you should plan on staying. They do have unlimited overtime at the moment which is nice but thats the only thing that is good about this job.
good,"They are dirty, i was constantly sick. And their equioment does not work half of the time. But if you can handle that then the pay is good enough to stick around."
good,I love to interact with co-workers and interact with my customers to levae a possitive impact on everybody I come in contact with at the work enviorment. That is very important to me. I wanna have the best time I can while im working.
good,"The overall company is very good, but not able to further a career."
good,1) Work culture is good
good,I have worked in the document management services and solutions industry for over 30 years. Great company and great people!
good,saxon / Xerox is Florida largest copier company document management systems
good,"Extremely condusive to learning, managing people, partners, team and yourself."
good,Verify correct batch header for product
good,The job is a fun place to work and as i stated in the the review summary it is a stress free enviroment. A typical day for me at work is coming in jumping on the phones and assisting customers with there computer problem's. I know all of my co-workers because there is only about 80 of us in a small area and we all seem to get along great. The hardest part of my job is when my system freezes up and i am unable to assist the customer at that time. But the most enjoyable part of my day is getting the angry customer on the line and by the time the call is over the customer issue is resolved and they are happy.
good,A very busy printing production due to high volume for our customer. Lerned how to operate black & white printers and color & the whole production floor from when job would get to scheduler to the end product.
good,Manage a portfolio of campus based student loans for colleges and universities across the United States.
good,Productive work place with hard working employees willing to get the job done. Co-Workers not so friendly however some where delightful. My team made my position easy and fast paced loved them. Learned that my management team while I was on it wasn't so delightful and honest however some where great supervisors who made Xerox easy to come to work everyday.
good,Depends on your management team. The support and willingness of your team and how much they support you.
good,"The most enjoyable time is with co-workers. The hardest part are the machines blarring and not being able to hear conversations or to conduct business. I've learn how to do emails, being introduce to microsoft word , excel, and power point. I still need to use it more as to increase my ablilties."
good,"I've worked for the company for 10+ years and make less now than I did when I first started with the company. Though it is an easy job for the most part (depending on the department), it's very stressful with unpredictable hours and unstable piece rate grids which change constantly."
good,"I learned a lot from this workplace. I started off as an agent and within a month moved up as a training assistance. I then excelled within the company with this new opportunity and became a lead trainer and certified trainer. I made history at Xerox becoming the youngest #1 certified trainer. I then moved to the next level and became a Continued Education Trainer. I trained my GM, OM, TM, other trainers, and all agents. I enjoyed learning new information and organizing this information to be taught back to other management and employees."
good,Xerox is a company that has fantastic products and services as it relates to document management. Most companies would be hard pressed to match their processes and quality of products.
good,Hardest part of Job was constant change in custumer experience and interpretation of benefits. Typical work day consisted of 60 calls or more and alot of document reading.
good,"Time management required."
good,Good environment with lots of opportunities. Weak points: salary is not as expected.
good,Was fun kind of but also not so fun. Cliques and social groups that I Was not a part of - didn't have much fun but some people were nice. Give it a go if you want to work for a company that had its heyday in the 70s.
good,This job provided good benefits and had the potential to be a great career path. The management was highly unprofessional and treated staff members as they would a friend. There was a lot of favoritism in the office.
good,"It's a call center. The department I worked in was with Verizon, I was in the prepay department. A typical day at work is always fun if you enjoy your team and supervisor."
good,"If you are aiming for a work-life balance, this would be your choice."
good,"""That's how we've always done it"".  There are a lot of long term people there.  There isn't a lot of money to go around, and a lot of things are outdated."
good,"In this benefits call center, it was expected for you to be knowledgeable to handle the high volume of incoming calls. Most of the time you had to start as a temp then apply for a permanent position."
good,"I don't know if it was just the management at the time, but it seemed to be a pretty cut-throat environment when I worked there. "
good,"When i worked at Xerox it was a very chill job, we had a lot of calls from providers that i dint mind...however i did want to grow the company but however there was no room for achievements thats when i was there. i was making $11.00 for 2 years."
good,Xerox offers opportunities consistent with Fortune 500 companies but is challenged in driving revenue growth and has been shrinking for the last 10 yrs.
good,"Started here when the company was ACS and then acquired by Xerox.  The transition was seamless."
good,The job was enjoyable only because of the people you worked with but very unorganized. The process of how calls were to be made and how information was entered into the system was almost constantly changing. The clients we worked for were complicated and management almost never knew what exactly we were supposed to be doing.
good,"The one thing I enjoyed about Xerox was my Co-Workers. We were one team working for the betterment of our team. A typical day at Xerox; with a team of 15 we would start the day with all open items from the previous day that have not been resolved. After this, we would discuss what current account deadlines and what steps are needed to meet those deadlines and who was available to help other team members. I was the team leader so I made it a point to make sure my co-worker's needs were accommodated."
good,"I had a wonderful career at Xerox.  The best part of my job was assisting my customers both internal and external to the company.  We had very loyal customers and great products."
good,"I would take inbound calls for tech support, fixing Verizon phones for people having issues. People would be pretty angry and I took it personally, which is my own fault. It was a pretty stressful work environment because most people were unhappy. The work place was pretty inappropriate as managers were having relations with employees. I did learn to come out of my comfort zone and bettered my communication skills. I learned how to resolve issues on cell phones. The hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers. The most enjoyable was when I would get happy customers who were grateful for my help and also the other co-workers that worked with me on a team were pretty great and made for a better experience."
good,"J'ai fais mon premier stage chez Xerox en tant qu'assistante communication. Cela a été une bonne expérience, très enrichissante au sein d'une équipe soudée."
good,"I loved the family environment we had & how flexible the schedules were, the supervisors always made sure we had time off to handle home family problems."
good,"Xerox is a great place to work if you are looking for a faced pace dynamic environment.  Most of my experience prior to Xerox was with smaller companies.  My current management team is great."
good,Xerox provides continuous support and training to its employees for growth and development and to help realize each individual's goals. Employees are given work-life balance
good,"Working at Xerox can be a challenge but you come away ahead trying to improve to do better for the customers. Some of the management time was inexperienced and would worry about themselves more that trying to help the customer."
good,Good People. Good work Life Balance flexible.Can move around teams and get better understanding of the systems. Helpful people. Some are really smart and mentor well.
good,"nice peers, environment ok, low salary, it's a paycheck, good starting point for just out of college, some advancement, stuck in legacy system, secure property"
good,Nice place to work but the pay was not what you will need in a growing city like Raleigh NC. The pay increases are slow coming from Xerox.Great work environment.
good,"On a typical day at Xerox, I would be receiving incoming calls from customers who need to process payments or enroll into an insurance policy. The healthcare benefits are outstanding, its a very competitive experience. The most challenging duty is making sure all customer complaints are handle in the most professional way and that they are 'highly satisfied' by the end of a call! If you prefer not to interact with people face-to-face, this may be a good job for you."
good,"Conduent was a very fast-paced and semi-structural job. things were very unorganized and not very well put together. The information they give you in training is very helpful. it is like a class, the more you pay attention, the more you will understand and grasp the concept."
good,"When I started working for Xerox I was excited. I was there to a job and give it my all.We answered inbound calls only, took applications and assisted callers with their questions and concerns. Over time my excitement faded. The work environment was unhealthy although they tried to make it a little more pleasant at times, it was still stressful.Dealing with the clients, co-workers and politics of the company made my job harder. Most of the time I had a 96 or higher on my QA score and was happy when I received a certificate each time for accomplishing that goal. I also felt good when I was able resolve an issue that a client was having."
good,Fast paced computer work for 8-10 hours per day. Learned Medical codes. Management was okay for the most part. The hardest part of the job was having to sit at a screen for hours on end and only getting a 20 minute lunch. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay.
good,Good place to learn and work collaboratively. Get to work on new technologies and new products. Good support from management but usually the launch or products is chaotic and stressful.
good,"Nettes Team, Freundliche Teammitglieder"
good,Xerox was a fast paced work environment that I enjoyed working for. the company itself doesn't seem very stable at the top and are always making changes
good,"heb dit jaren gedaan"
good,"You get to work with people from around the world."
good,"I was made aware that my job was outsourced 7 years ago to all contractors. It was a VERY fast paced job, but really fun for the first 14 years. after a while, folks retired, and they didn't get replaced. it just became insane. The training they provided was second to none, and they trained EXCELLENT managers. I am spoiled, because I now know what an excellent supervisor is supposed to be like."
good,Overall good place to work.Lot of mandatory overtime which can be good but also bad.Did not agree with the paying system they used at all.Those were the main cons otherwise offered flexibility and good benefits.
good,"Sometime in the late 2000's, Xerox lost focus of what is takes to grow a company.  Instead of investigating in research & development of new products, the company decided to focus on switching services.  It also focused on increasing share holder value, which led to layoffs on an annual basis.  As a result, it became increasingly demoralizing to work for Xerox.  Unfortunately, Xerox is now a shell of the great company that it once was."
good,In general my years at Xerox was enjoyable.  I learned a lot and grew professionally.  Benefits and compensation were great but job security was not there.  At any day layoffs were announced.
good,"I worked for the services side of Xerox, taking service calls on the supported devices. All the employees that worked at this particular location were contracted by staffing agencies which made turnover very high. It was constant state of training new people which made the day to day stuff go on the back burner. Shortly after I left this location Xerox sold this division of the company to Seimens, so It currently does not exist anymore, me giving a real review is obsolete at this point."
good,"Four 10 hour days per week. Had to punch in by a set time and be ready to take inbound customer calls by a certain time. I was trained to service the routine customer questions and questions. All calls might be recorded and later analyzed for purposes of correction or recommendations. Some callers were rude and / or obnoxious and you could not hang up on them even if it was obvious that there was nothing more you could do for them. A customer survey might be taken after each call and you would be rated based on the results of that survey. There were cubes of privilege for those whose metrics were good and cubes of correction for those whose stats did not meet the supervisor's standard. You had to make notes on every call - which was very time consuming in some cases and the more time you took to make these comments, the more it detracted from your stats."
good,Large company hired through manpower and after working there many months was told that only 1 of 3 would be offered permanent placement with company benefits.
good,"I am a lead hand overseeing a crew that is in charge of chemical production in a lean manufacturing setting.  I also take part in wastewater management, quality control analyses, chemical operations, and joint health and safety."
good,"Field service work is enjoyable in its variety and independence. Learning new tech is a park. But like most service jobs, it has become a numbers game. Every aspect of your work is quantified and at least one aspect will  fail to meet a targets. This leads to management and employee dissatisfaction. Helping customers and feeling pride in your accomplishments is still a priority for most employees. There was a shift away from sharing information that would truly help employees interact and do the job better."
good,Typical Call Center Environment. This is a great place to work if they could keep their clients satisified. The training modules are not to bad but I would recommend this place to anyone who seeks OT.
good,Muy buena pero no tan buena yo pienso que podria estar mejoer
good,Enrollment of customers into Blue Cross & Blue Shield Heath Insurance plans. Answered coverage inquires on local Net-work providers & deductibles plus co-pays.
good,A typical day at work with Xerox is coming into the office. Then logging into the computer system and proceed to begin to take phone calls. Speaking with the customers about new changes to the Medi-cal program. Mostly as a CSR you will be dealing with a lot of customers that call in asking for clarification about items they receive in the mail.
good,"I learnt many things by the company like honest , adaptability, accurate , being simple,etc "
good,"Worked for Xerox Solutions at their call center for over a year. Customer Service work is always bound to be stressful between calls and mandatory OT, the problem is that management made it even more stressful. Unnecessary, really. Every few months a new supervisor would be assigned not based on merit but based on who they were friends to who. Only a handful of management were good supervisors and team leads. The systems would never work yet they would expect you to work with it. The bonus incentives were a joke, they would always change them so people wouldn't get them. Work colleagues were the best of this job, willing to make everyday fun in the middle of all the stress."
good,"helping customers receive the medication they need was a great feeling at this job. long days on the phone but a great relaxed workplace setting, i would work here again if able"
good,"buenas politicas laborales."
good,"A typical day at work includes clocking in at 6:30 am and getting off around 4:30 or 5:00 pm. I worked the weekend shift, which was fine for me. Great"
good,I learned a lot from working with the company. It is very is easy to move up in the company. The supervisors work with you. The calls are easy. Awesome!
good,"No Comment, My mother always said if you don't have a positive reflection. do not reflect at all. Now that's not to say my reflection in positive or negative. Xerox is a good Company"
good,"very easy to get fired especially when new employees are hired, they don't have enough seats for the amount of cubicles that are available. hr is okay, supervisors are okay."
good,I learned many computer functions and the ins and outs of the mailroom. On site training was always available and the ability to learn new task. Friendly co-workers and management.
good,The management allows position to get to their head. They are extremely money motivated do not care about their customers just meeting their groups goal by the end of the week.
good,"A typical day consisted of handling 3-5 escalation calls, coaching and developing team members. Writing and sending reports to the Operations Manager."
good,"productive fun place to work needs some improvements in some areas, been there about a year and half and still is not permeant with any benefits. that"
good,"Asked to do alot. Not compensated for the level of work required. "
good,"I liked the work atmosphere, sometimes the support was not available. For the most part the supervisors really cared about the staff and their work.  Working with them to gain the knowledge needed to perform the work"
good,Xerox was a good place with great pay. My workday started with finding a computer to start taking calls. I was an Apple technical support representative. I helped customers fix issues with their Apple products. I've learned to have patience with others and to use my time wisely. Having potluck with my team was one of the fun things I enjoyed.
good,".bussy traveling"
good,"xerox was a fun place to work. i enjoyed my supervisor and collegues, but i had to quit unfortunately due to an unexpected family emergency"
good,Work schedule was never the same meaning you can come in on a scheduled day and be told you have mandatory overtime that day or either the following morning. The managers there had their own agenda and no one was on the same page which caused a lot of confusion within the company
good,Management was very effective and helpfully. Employee's and college's were enjoyable to be around. Super busy at time and lots of room for growth in the printing industry.
good,Leuk om in een internationale werkomgeving te werken met zoveel verschillende teams. Veel contact met de klant
good,"Xerox a business solutions company contracted the Client Sprint PCS for their inbound customer service calls. I enjoyed the most part was talking to people from all over the United States, the worst part however was the times you would recieve those LTE upgrade calls because most customers would be irate. However it taught me to keep a good tone and make sure the customer at the end of the call was satisifed and/or the Issue was resolved. This being my first call center job I mastered the metrics they would base are pay off of and was segmented #1. Sadly Xerox decided to switch clients to Cox Communications and it was just downhill from there."
good,"1. Give recruiters as many contact options as possible. Providing a phone number you can be reached at during the day - whether it's an office number, cell phone, etc. - will make it easier for recruiters to coordinate opportunities with you."
good,"Receive job tickets and download. Edit if necessary. Send to various printers for operators to print. Provide any finishing and prepare to ship."
good,"Month end reporting is a busy work week but after that, it's a smooth days for us. They offer competitive compensation and benefits. But what I like most is the monthly incentive based on our performance."
good,"Call center job with fun incentives and fun days on the job and just pretty awesome people. The calls could be difficult but there was a lot of support on the floor at all times. I would go back if I needed something to fall back on where ever they may have locations that are still open, the one I worked at has since closed."
good,"I did enjoy my role in WDS/Xerox really, but all good things have been demolished by the incompetent management. HR department had does not care about employee, our salary was the same for 4 years - but requirements were higher and higher than we could to do."
good,"Good management, but a rather limited traditional work culture.  Business oriented, segmented work place.  The culture appeared fragmented.  Some areas/ divisions were singularly focused on narrow tasked based, goal oriented accomplishments, while others areas offered a more open environment. This was probably due to the old business genesis of the copier business.  However Xerox is known for their technical inventions.  They were the original creator of the window based graphical operating system made famous by apple and Micorsoft.  They invented the ""mouse"", as well as modern computer networking.  They are also know for having started more startups by former employee's than any other business.  Good people with unimaginative management."
good,"I have worked for this company for over a year and while I have enjoyed most of the work and people I believe that this is not the place to move up and grow with the company. The business units do not last long enough to build on your skills and move up. "
good,This company has many different departments from a call center to data entry. Co-workers are always more than willing to help understand each process.
good,This company hires mostly minorities and works closely with two temporary companies. The associates often feel like the are not need and can be easily terminated. The team coaches as well as supervisors never return the customers calls when they need to speak with upper management.
good,Individual contribution is must for any firm.You have to provide estimate for your task. By handling multiple projects you will learn to manage time in an efficient way.
good,"Es una buena empresa, pagan mas que su competencia pero brinda menos prestaciones"
good,"A typical day would include, developing solutions for customers that would help their businesses bottom line, and help them grow."
good,"At xerox, you never know what kind of day it will be. Just prepare yourself to get a bad call. Management is not very happy when they have to take over a call. I learned a lot about health insurance. the hardest part of the job is sitting on a call trying not to hang up because you are being verbally abused."
good,"Procuro uma empresa que me proporcione crescimento profissional na área que eu atuo, ou em demais áreas do meu interesse, estou disposto a fazer a diferença."
good,Your taking phone calls all day. you get 2 ten min breaks and 30 min lunch. Make sure you are nice and remember that every single phone call is being listened to. You are being graded on your calls. The phone calls start at 5am and feels like they never stop coming in. I have never gotten off when i was suppose to due to last min phone calls coming in.
good,"The prizes and pay incentives were great, and I did enjoy being able to pick up more hours if I needed the overtime. I think management expected very high goals from supervisors and that usually created more than  which were tough to meet creating a very stressful work environment"
good,It was  a  great  experience .  The opportunity  for  training  and  personal  development  was heads and  shoulders  above  all  companies  I've ever  been  employed  by .  I would  recommend  Xerox  to anyone  as a great place  to  work  and develop .
good,"I have four friends that will stay with me the rest of my live from this place. Call-centers drain the life from you, that's no lie, but if I didn't have to leave for medical reasons (hence mended) I would probably managing my department; Xerox was one of my favorite jobs. The managers were so personable, and the people, though occasionally self-deprecating (you have to find humor somewhere in these type of jobs) were amazing. "
good,I encode medical forms in the whole 8 hour shift and sometimes up to 12 hours if I have to do and overtime. The hardest part of the job is to stay awake especially during night shifts and avoid subsidy pay. The enjoyable part is that I improved my typing speed skills.
good,"I love my job, my co-workers and the workplace. My work got easy because I enjoy providing assistance to our clients. The Supervisors are easy to work with as well and they are always there to answer questions. However, I don't like the idea that we are forced to render VTO every now and then and it directly affects my financial status. I also felt that we don't have the security of tenure and anytime we will lose our job."
good,"There are many things that I am not satisfied with when it comes to working here, but there are some great benefits to this job. It comes with a lot of flexibility. You work alone and you can move at your own pace. It isn't that strenuous of a job but you're able to get things done in a timely matter. Management is really great and she understands the fact that life still exists outside of the work environment."
good,"Full time desk job, consistent back to back inbound calls assisting customers with account assistance, processing applications for renewal or initial, friendly work environment, to the point."
good,"* Good working culture"
good,"There is lack of communication from the company as a whole. Most of the important departments close during EST when i work on MST. It makes it very hard to do my job and help customers. We are also understaffed, there is barely a moment to breathe when we are always 50+ calls waiting."
good,"It was a great company, although there was kind of lack of training. Great environment working with people from different countries, very good working hours also possibility to work extra hours and being well paid."
good,"When I joined XEROX it was a great place to work, however over time it became a place of yearly layoffs.     Upper level management decided to focus on service business and not invest in technology."
good,A job that gives you ability to grow and promote to different positions and co-workers were very friendly and management was fair. It was a very easy job once you've been properly trained.
good,"Very weak Union. No more job guarantee, raises, bonuses, flex time, etc... but union dues keep going up. Non-union jobs are better."
good,"I worked on 2 projects for Xerox, Verizon Wireless & CVS Caremark. Overall, I worked on teams with a lot of great people that I am friends with now.  While there were challenges, overall I learned a lot from my time on each project, and am glad I got the opportunity to work there"
good,A good place to work. But the work hours are really crazy.Wish they could get more of a balance going.So that job work/life balance was really even.
good,"It is your typical call center, except it is considered a hot seat environment meaning you may not have a desk and when you do it is never with your team/manager. In this job you need to be able to handle a bunch of complaints with customer always thinking they are rite and wanting a credit for everything. You have to learn how to distinguish weather they deserve it or not.  I was promised that when I got hired I could work mornings/days, this was only the case during training I am now stuck on nights and because I don't have tenure I can not come of the shift. I would say if you like call centers and can work on your own, and as well like the night shift this is a good job for you."
good,Xerox is a great company to gain experience in a leadership role. You will get the opportunity to work with major clients in the industry perfecting your craft.
good,"Excellent!!! Productive and great learning environment. Low salaries, constant lay-offs."
good,It's good to start here with an office job. However the company is still struggle to make the right transition from a normal company to a Multinational organization. Unfortunately right now missing the benefits and fighting with the issues which makes some blow-back on the employees.
good,"How to be productive in the work place, I get along with my co-workers, I look forward to something challenge when it comes to doing something outside my daily route."
good,"An very simple customer service job. It is all about connecting with the customer. If you can do that, you're set to go. Perfect job for paying your bills while looking for a career."
good,"I answer calls for Department of Children and Family Service clients. Most of the clients are really upset and very rude  so that can be a bit challenging at times. The supervisors and co workers are great! I hate that the pay rate is ABC because it greatly effects your pay when the number of calls drop during certain times of the month. Rules change on a daily basis and that can be very aggravating. Lunch breaks are way to short. Overall, it's an okay job."
good,Enjoyed 10 of the 15 years at ACS/Xerox. Deployment of key roles off shore for purposes of competitive costs caused issues in the quality of services delivered
good,"going from customer to customer resolving their issues,learning to handle various personalities and situations.management usually supportive and co-workers always helpful.hardest part of job was sometimes diagnosing equipment problems but being out on your own was enjoyable"
good,"Side by sides, coaching agents, researching calls writing disputes, helping with CBT's. Floor coverage while supervisor in mandatory meetings. Checked reprocessing of medical/ pharmacy claims that were processed in error. Fetch RTA/CMS offenders and see where help is needed.  Informed agents of updates for ANOC/PCP alerts recoding’s  Verify CBT’s completed system accesses. Assist with preparing various echo reports."
good,"Hours were manageable, overtime was available most of the time. Great pay! Management was remarkable! Project I worked was a great company to work for."
good,I learned how to use software quickly and how to handle a high stress environment. The call center management is only into their numbers and how best to get largest income.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew and it was more difficult to get to know the new people. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day, ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting."
good,"A typical day would be sitting on your computer log in. you wait for instruction on which county you will be processing plates for. Often times you switch multiple times between counties and must know the certain rules for each on how they process there plates. Because each county has its own set of rules. They will brief you on each one before you get started so you have a general idea on how it works. YOu will have a sheet of information to that specific county so you wont get confused. Threw out this job I figured you have  to type fairly quickly and not get tired. Management is usually very happy to assist you with anything you need from how to do the work. To if you could receive a day off. Co-workers are friendly for the most part. Its usually extremely quit so some one knows when your not working. Hardest part about the job is staying awake. You either work by 6am to 3:30pm  or 3:40 to 1:00am. Also it can become boring from time to time doing the same thing over and over again for hours. The most enjoyable part was getting to snack on foods here and there and I got to have my drinks near me as long as I kept my work area clean."
good,The job doesn't pay you what it should to have to deal with the stress that it may bring.However the environment is very friendly. You are able to get a lot of certifications in the banking industry you could use later on.
good,love working with the people at Xerox. better management is needed though. but still a great place for growth and advancement.
good,"There are times that workloads are unmanageable but we always have colleagues who always there to assist."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping and interacting with customers. My co-workers were pretty awesome. The atmosphere was a little overwhelming and it made me feel like the overall workplace was unorganized
good,"Em minha ultimas duas áreas onde fui pioneiro nos serviços prestados, pude me desenvolver e aprimorar minhas competências, por saber o quão é difícil começar do zero e a cada etapa ajustes, erros, falhas e satisfação. A gerencia sempre apoiando e dando o suporte necessário, os colaboradores apoiavam e acompanhavam o desenvolvimento da empresa e seus objetivos e metas."
good,"Recently there has been a complete restructure of the way the company is ran. The supervisors are personable and I really enjoy the people I work with.  Some of the calls get tough and some of customers think they are entitled to everything in the world, but who doesn't like a good challenge? ;)  The pay is better than it was a year ago when I started and reviewed quarterly."
good,"Buena empresa con un buen ambiente de trabajo, se promueve el trabajo en equipo, con las prestaciones que estipula la ley."
good,I was privileged to assist in development of the learning and development department along with some of the greatest trainers and supervisors during that time.
good,"clock in, log on to your computer, get ready to take calls. Helped customers with tech support, troubleshooting devices, features, and apps."
good,"I worked at a call centre and judging that we worked contracted to a cellular its not what I call an easy job. I had to deal with customers that would yell and stress me out my supervisor did his best to keep his crew me included sane. Xerox would go through people like no tomorrow and that being said the job was not for everyone. There are points in the job that I would breeze through it or I would have difficulty taking the next call out of fear that there was going to be someone that would explode and I would be on the receiving end and I would break down or something but following that I need to have X amount of calls in X amount of time made it more stressful and you cant take a break to breath which made it hard. People that work this job and do it well I would say is made of steel I don’t know how they do it if anything just to get work experience this is a good place to go but take some yoga, tai-chi something to help cool your jets before and after work. I will also say there is something about working with some people that is down right awesome and stories to be told and some people that will make your day I just wish there was more of them."
good,Great Company to work for. Great culture. Large organization that will specialize in businesses solutions for organizations and state divisions. The focus is alway on the client.
good,Xerox is a good place to work if you dont have long term goals with the company. My project did not offer room for advancement or any bonuses or pay raise.
good,"Place can be hard to work at, at time due to co-workers alot of nosy people will want to get in your business. I'm a quiet person so I basically keep to my self."
good,you would go in at a given time about five minutes before scheduled so that you could get logged into everything and get on the phones. learned that lots of people want a person on the phone with an upbeat attitude that is willing to joke with them to put them more at ease with the process and are greatful to for the little changes that can make when dealing with a stressful problem. the hardest part of the job is sitting still for so long and when the calls are coming in so fast that you do not have time to finish or save notes. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to speak with so many different people and having the chance to help them when needed.
good,I loved my co-workers. I have made life long friends working there. The no fault attendance system is the hardest thing. If you have kids that are sick and they are not able to go to school and daycare. You will get pointed for missing those days even with a doctor notes.
good,"Easy if you have experience in the call center customer service industry. Any job is what you make it. Located in Yukon, Oklahoma"
good,A typical day at work consists of customer service related job duties in a call center environment. I have learned a vast amount of information regarding the cell phone industry. The hardest part of this job is a large part of our pay is determined on customer satisfaction and often times we are not given the tools necessary to resolve the customers' issues in a quick efficient manner due to outsourcing. The most enjoyable part of my job is that there are many schedules to choose from. We are able to choose a new schedule with set days off every 6-8 months. I also have the opportunity to work from home 4 days a week due to excellent job performance.
good,Carr is a solid company well positioned for future success. Sales and service focused on a best in class customer experience.
good,"Typically my workday consists of answering questions and helping member's get things taken care of. Don't misunderstand, I love my job. I feel great when I get to help people. However, I would like to work in an environment where there is more room for growth and the potential for advancement. I want a position where what I do is truly valued and appreciated, where I am seen as a valued team member."
good,"Xerox call center is a good employment opprtunity, although the management could use some improvement, its a great work enviornment."
good,"Basically all i would do is show up at two pm and work till eleven pm and just take phone calls and try to fix complications with the network or phone issues not being able to connect to the internet or the mobile towers. i learned how to fix phones while doing steps to help ensure the customer can do it while on another phone. Management was really good don't see them around much but always taught us something new. hardest part for me was taking a call where the customer was screaming at me for something i didn't do and i would try to calm them down but if it didn't work that made my day so much worse. the most enjoyable part was when the customer would say ""sir you did an awesome job i rate you 10 for everything and you also made my day better"" that made the job worth while"
good,"High call volume was a normal day.  I learned not to take it personal when customers called disgruntled about premium amounts, coverage, or services in general."
good,work day was simple with the incoming callers.  A small amount of the management and some co-workers made it difficult to excel but nothing stops my motivation to keep going.  Majority of the co-workers was a pleasure to be around making you want to do overtime.
good,A typical day at work was being on the phone helping customers. Learned to be patient and the importance of the job.
good,"My typical day starts at 8:00 am.  After clocking in, I check my email and determine where I am needed for the day.  Although I was recently promoted, I have not actually performed in that capacity as of yet.  I typically assist new hires with handling their calls, and take on escalated calls and issues.  I also sit with the representatives and observe them (side-by-side). I also provide feedback on how the call was handled.  My co-workers are typically on the phones all day and depend on me for support as it relates to call handling, policies and procedures, call metrics, technical issues, and escalated issues.  The hardest part of my job is not being able to give customers all they ask for.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help others."
good,"Answering phones, handling multiple phone lines, collecting customer information and analyzing customer needs, multitasking, Resolving Conflict"
good,"I was only there a month. Everyone was friendly, and had their own ways of doing the job, but it definitely got done. It was difficult for me to grasp the speed of everything, because it was always changing. I made it through training, which took six weeks, and then when put on the floor, I had a difficult time keeping up with talking to the customer whilst looking for information on the computer."
good,Dealing with angry customers throughout the day. Compensation is good and based on individual work. Work harder and get paid more for it. Very stressful at times. Very fast paced.
good,"Great employees, some of the managers are very helpful. Learned a lot about credit cards. You basically did the same thing every day which is filling out applications."
good,"A empresa Xerox do Brasil dentro prestadora de serviço a empresas como GMB, Itaú, CCE, entre outras, devido algumas mudanças de estratégia,custo e mão de obra mais barata, alguns deptos migram para outro País."
good,"I did enjoy my employment at Xerox, I liked that it gave paid training, and the benefits were quite nice, however, there was a lot of inconsistency from training to the actual work floor. I thoroughly enjoyed the positive energy of my coworkers and the connections made with them. I enjoyed the open communication with my supervisors and their constructive feedback. Many of them were also very positive as well. The company needs a lot of work with bringing in new faces and their training environment. A lot of the time there was confusion about the curriculum and how to go about it. The training hours are also less than to be desired. I had to miss a wedding AND my mother's college graduation (which they said in the recruiting office I could get that time off) because training times are so strict and they hold it against you if you miss days during training. I had perfect attendance in training, but it was hard missing important dates like that without any make up for it when I actually got onto the work floor. The equipment in the building also needs to be updated. There were a few incidents where people struggled helping customers with broken and outdated equipment. Their systems were down 4 times in the short time I worked there, so obviously system issues and updates need to be completed as well. One woman I worked with had her desk completely fall apart and the computer land on top of her because the desk was so broken down and maintenance had overlooked it."
good,"The work environment is messy but it was an ok experiance, its a good company to work for."
good,"10 hour days flew by !"
good,"A typical day at work would start around 9am with follow up phone calls, schedule meeting appointments with clients and plan a cold calling route for the day.  "
good,"A consistently busy work environment. The majority of the work day would be spent on the phone negotiating with attorneys, insurance companies and customers. I would enter claims, maintain accurate records and would need to think on my feet. I learned a great deal about the law and negotiation skills. Management was not very involved, my direct supervisor I never met and in fact lived in another state. I worked well with other co-workers and maintain many friendships. The most difficult part of my job was that there was no room for advancement. I enjoyed that my job was always busy and consistently learned new information."
good,"I learned how to be patient and take verbal abuse"
good,Productive and friendly workplace with many outdoor activities.
good,"Enjoyed my job, enjoyed working with others, and learning different jobs"
good,the people that I have gotten to know over the years are great people to work for and with.
good,"Learned a lot about the business, able to work independently,"
good,Working for Xerox is fun if you like talking to a diverse group of people. They were flexible with hours understanding that people have families outside of work. My manager was very helpful and an effective communicator. I learned a significant amount about technical support and am thankful that I had this job. Great entry level job.
good,"the job itself can be stressful, but as long as you are great at customer service and you show up ready to work, then it's not that bad."
good,Working in the Global Corporate Advertising Group gave me a great snapshot of the Xerox enterprise and all of the moving pieces that make our company what it is. The environment is always changing and there are new challenges every day.
good,"In my company we work hard to our maximum production which we always achieve our target with out error and take initiate when ever required by the company."
good,"Good to be working, looking for some better options as want to explore my expertise in other better companies."
good,"Consited of processing payments for Gov. having to do with school loans. Learned alot of new things, it was never boring. I sat at a desk infront of a computer all day. Hardest part was no daily enteraction with new people. Best part was the pay, it was close to my home, the hours where good and I enjoyed the people i worked with."
good,Pay is ok and most of the people I work with are nice. No room to grow and you don't get raises very often and when you do they are minimal. I like that I can come to work and get my stuff done without anyone telling me what to do and when to do it.
good,The days are just like any other day some good and some bad but the people are great to work with. They make the bad days better.
good,Working for Xerox Independent Blue Cross was very rewarding.  I had the opportunity to travel.  I worked from home. I became very fond of the members that we serviced daily.  I would often talk to some the elderly members.  They had so much knowledge to offer. I learned the policies and procedures of how and when medicare could be obtained and used. There wasn't anythiing hard about the job becasue I enjoyed it tremendously. My co-workers were from different parts of the United States and of various nationalities.  I have had the pleasure of visiting some of them in their home state and experience their culture.
good,Over 10 years at Xerox enabled me to learn and accomplish many things however my job was affected due to a company restructure. Xerox was a great place to work and my co-workers were among some of the best. Personal development was top priority there. I will miss working there.
good,"The job was easy to learn the ropes, but the compensation structure is not as promised."
good,Xerox hired about 500 people to train in their call center but offered very few if any actual full time positions. This is what they refer to as open enrollment.
good,"i love working there,good friendly people, work space clean good pay loved my supervisor just a really good place to work."
good,I have learned a great deal of handling and deescalating calls. I have learned more about health insurance and medical plans. I am confident with taking complex matters/calls and resolving the issue for the client or member.
good,the staff at xerox was nice and helpful when you didnt know exactly to do do in some situations. if you are good with change and  technology and need a job were you aren't out in the sun/cold then this is the place working with the customers does get interesting but its worth it you learn to love the job after working for longer then a month and you know how everything works
good,"Xerox is a good Company to work for quick advancement, Paid Time Off, Supported Supervisors it is overall a good company to work for."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help the member's get the most out of their insurance.
good,I learned to navigate through the systems. The co-workers were great in completing their job. the most enjoyable part of the job is making a difference and helping people.
good,"Decent advancement opportunities, fun/young atmosphere, opportunity to move into major accounts if you work real hard and sell enough. Great experience if you're looking to get into outside B2B sales (they'll take just about anyone since the turnover rate here is extremely high). "
good,"great company depending on OPS manager, i just had a great manager!"
good,Customers call to get assitance with their devices. I learned to navigate through different pages to search for information up. The management team was supportive if you need help. The hardest part of the job is not knowing actually what is wrong with their device or not being able to assist customer with their needs. I enjoyed calming people down when they are frustrated.
good,It is a close-knit work environment where information is shared openly with all employees.
good,"My job here was to look after our Key Account which was Sobeys Inc. and all of the sister banners. My job was to look after the ordering, production of and installation of various signage packages that were required by each banner as required by the customer. I had to ensure everything produced was to the standards set by the company and that all components were installed exactly according to the plans provided. I was a team effort to get everything produced and ready to go to the job site on the day that it was required and it was a feat of coordination that made everything possible. I worked with a dedicated group of people who all ensured a quality product and quality service. I learned how to manage projects and how to make sure everything was produced and finished on target. The hardest part of the job was working around any obstacles that popped up from time to time only because they seemed to happen just at the end so very little time was left for plan ""B"". The most enjoyable part of the job was after the work was completed and we received the compliments from the client as to how pleased they were with the end result. I should say none of this would have been possible without the support of the management team at out company. They help turn the mountains into small hills when needed and their effort was very much appreciated."
good,I really enjoyed working with the team I worked with at Xerox. It's unfortunate for company wide cut backs.
good,to monitor and report on the progress of production of all agents with in the company including multiple locations
good,For being a start up company we have managed to pull through the growing pains and establish a productive customer care environment. Fun and outgoing environment to work in.
good,"I worked in a call center for the Xerox client Verizon Wireless. Working in a call center was definitely a different experience. I am not too into sitting down at work all day so it was a little difficult for me in the beginning. There were a variety of people who worked here and they were all pretty friendly and willing to assist. Moving up in the company was a little difficult. With a call center environment there are a number of individuals under one supervisor, the numbers that the Customer Service Rep either ""makes or breaks"" their supervisor so naturally if a team is doing well, the supervisor benefits. The benefits come both in the forms of praise from his supervisor and money in his pocket. If others see this and ask to take an agent to advance it is up to the supervisor to let that rep go or not. If a rep is helping a supervisor make their ""winning team"" how likely is that supervisor to let them go? It is simply human nature, but not a very effective promotion system."
good,"Muito trabalho, muitas ligações, muitas solicitações de materiais e chamados técnicos, mas era bom, aprendi muito."
good,"i am currently working with xerox, i am a customer support rep for verizon wireless. Typical day i come in and i take calls and i go home, once a week i sit with my supervisor and lisen to a call and see what i can do to become a better customer service rep."
good,Job tasks are clearly outlined of what is expected. Change in those expectations change often as this organization is still fairly new and trying to establish itself.
good,"Working with Xerox can be fun and productive in theory, however multiple changing policies and the insistence of bureaucratic ideology leaves this company in the balance. I was a supervisor here of a team of 25 agents. There was a current policy of no team should be over 15 agents, however with growing training classes this policy was abolished and no new policy was created. Supervisors were responsible for every aspect of the client. I work for Sprint doing tech support. I was responsible for call evaluations, sales reports, sales numbers, ticket information, failed ticket reports, and invalid failed calls audits. This isn't the bad part, but what is the bad part was the lack of higher management support. I had to be all green in my metrics and for the most part I was, but when I needed time to couch or improve an agents skills, I was not allowed to dedicate time to one agent. I had 1 hour a week for a team meeting and though there was a policy for an hour for each agent to couch and train, I was not given this time. I had to be creative to make my agents understand their job and their responsibilities. Again this necessarily isn't the worst of the job, I actually enjoyed thinking of creative and policy driven ways to get my team to green. What is the worst is that there was an overwhelming push from upper management to conduct in less than honorable methods to getting green, including fudging sales numbers and committing fraud. I did not do these things, as I felt that my numbers will reflect the hard work that I put in to my team and nothing else. For that I was severely"
good,I enjoyed the places and the customers i serviced. When i would show up at a customers account i was Xerox and they knew they could count on me to resolve thier issues.
good,"benefits were the best part, xerox paid 100% and used blue cross blue sheild."
good,"A typical work day would be answering the phone constantly, resolving customers issues, sales, and avoiding customers hanging up the phone on you, hardest part of the job is dealing with non-pleasable customers."
good,"Great place to work. Nice work enviroment. However, I hear raises don't come too often."
good,"Great, competitive work environment with very dedicated employees at all levels of management. I work from home where I manage a production and quality-based compensation program for approximately 16,000 employees in 10 countries worldwide."
good,"I loved working with that company however, your schedule has to be totally free. Team supervisors and often times team members were demoted or lost their jobs because of ONE mistake. My belief is ""write ups"" and ""verbal warnings"" did not exist under all situations and many people were terminated without the issues being resolved effectively (myself included). One of my good friends had a sit down with our boss because of an issue he caused with his car in the parking lot. After letting him go with a warning, our training supervisor spoke with our boss, came back to my friend and told him he was fired."
good,Fast paced work enviroment with a diverse set of challenges daiy.
good,productive and fun work environment lots to do plus helping to develop your self and enhance your own agenda. Professional worker and work environment
good,"local agradável, falta um pouco de percepção em alguns aspectos"
good,"Xerox is an inbound and outbound call center, where you help enroll clients into health care plans of their choice. I learned a lot about health care with all the changes being made with the Affordable Care Act in effect. I passed the state exam and became certified in Exchange Enrollment Facilitator. This position was a 6 month contract so I only worked there for 6 months."
good,Fun environment to work if you're a student.  They work you in regards to scheduling especially if you're in need. Training was awesome! Great team!!!
good,Good people the machine and technicians were great  loved atmosphere just not enough hours and no pay raises .............................................
good,xerox is a place where there are stressful positions and positions that are not so stressful. The higher the pay the more stress. I am not satisfied with the way they pay. The pay scale can change every 6 months. It causes employees to be disgruntled and look for more consistent pay.
good,"In the job I perform daily, there is never a boring moment.  You will always have something to do which is great.  It can also be a very stress filled environment.  You are driving to several different places in a day and in many cases you may not know where they are exactly in traffic where people are not courteous or patient.  You are always tasked to do more and always being measured by what you accomplish.  There is never really a moment to catch your breath."
good,Es una empresa con salarios competitivos y la posibilidad de trabajar tiempo extra. Los supervisores son muy accesibles. Hay oportunidad de crecimiento si quieres.
good,"Xerox had excellent paid training for employees, learned how to trouble shoot computers the hard ware and the soft ware side."
good,"At Xerox, customer satisfaction is paramount. Regular management and team meetings are held where the performance is evaluated with the objective to improve. Constructive criticism is encouraged and team improvement is promoted."
good,"Fast pace working environment., stressful requirements  a bit stressful need to meet goals in customer surveys talk time, and on upgrades. Company wants sales no matter what."
good,"Conduent is overall a great place to work, it has that close-knit family vibe to it.  Things are never great 100% of the time but they do what they can with what they have.  It's not the environment for everyone, but it can be a blast with some great opportunities if you put in the effort and time."
good,Great working environment where employees were happy to go to daily. Too bad it closed up shop in Houston. One of the best places I've ever worked at.
good,"They should hire more full time permanent employees and pay health, dental, and 401 k benefits.  The division I worked for was bought by Conduent.  Managers were friendly and knew their jobs."
good,Constant mandatory overtime and shift permanent changes. No consistent work hours in the week made it hard to adapt to.  Very good pay and benefits .  The bonus process was very competitive and created a stressful environment.  I decided to retirement and seek a more peaceful line of work like teaching.
good,"It's a good company to get your feet wet with in terms of working at a call center but the contracts they sign with aren't very good companies, clientele are generally high stressed and not very easily pleased, causing for a very high stressed and unproductive work environment."
good,"Customers are often times upset or need help with their devices. While helping customers is a nice feeling, the environment can get hectic and stressful. I have come away with life skills that I did not have before working here and was also able to climb the ladder to leadership in a relatively short amount of time."
good,Stressful environment.  Lazy workers that don't want to pull there own weight cause there covered by the union  and frown on over achievers.  Things have changed since I worked there  could be better now.
good,"Esta tranquilo el ambiente, fue divertido. las tareas estaban bien definidas, habia tiempo extra y el pago era aceptable."
good,"No I don’t want to. It’s boring , parking sucks it’s very ghetto and ratchet .  Training was a breeze but the production floor had its downfall had to leave"
good,No complaints.  Working for Xerox allowed me to gain valuable experience in the corporate arena. Good benefits and the environment was very welcoming.
good,"Decent place to work, very hectic and seems like a major lack of communication between the client, executive management and the front line. Managers I personally worked with were great though. Most enjoyable part of job was helping customers feel like they were getting there moneys worth on service/product. "
good,"- Perfect working hours (7:00 AM to 3:30 PM) for working mothers to drop the children to school and pick them up after work.  "
good,I enjoyed what I did felt like My supervisor allowed peers to control her thinking an how she perceived people who she hired an fired.  I feel like if your a manager or Team lead if I come to you with a problem that's going on. Management don't have the right to put you down an go too the person an tell them what you say... Then laugh with them.
good,"Friendly environment, my manager was excellent, however the only cons was that it is a contract company. Thus, if your contract was not renewed or extended, you no longer have a job."
good,Xerox is a relaxed yet fast paced work environment. It's a great job to have job advancement and bettering your experience and job opportunities. Must have the ability to multitask.
good,"Good company to work for. The position held was a technical support position where the hirer Tier agent are very helpful as well as the upper management.  They are friendly and easy to bring an issue to.  "
good,People are very hard working and supportive of one another.  Change in management made continuity difficult.  I will be leaving to secure my retirement package.  That was the only reason.
good,"Start 7:00 mandatory , Never know when will finish. Work on piece raid. Work is separated for friends and others. Management are careless for workers. But they have good benefits. If you keep the rules will not be fired."
good,If you don't mind the call center environment and can deal with always being on the phone while getting to solve many people's technical problems when it comes to their apple products then this job is good for you.
good,"For many years was a very nice place to work for but last few years work has been off-shored. For me personally, job was rewarding and I was happy with overall benefit package"
good,"I only worked 1 year with Xerox, but while working there I was able to advance and there was a lot of opportunity to excel.  Therefore, I would recommend someone to work for them."
good,Good pay but long history of massive layoffs. The union protects and goes to bat for only those that are lazy and pressures those that care about their work to slow down.
good,This job is perfect for a person with a family due to the hours usually off on weekends and always off on holidays but there is no job security and they do not offer raises there is no room for growth
good,"good team building, training, company vehicle,"
good,"A typical day at work consist of getting up, dressing appropriately for the job. Clocking in at 8:30. Logging into my computer. Getting notes of the board and starting my day.....Recieve calls from providers for clients usually insured with Blue Cross and Shield....Going thru Diagnosic Codes, Procedure Codes, Claims and Benifits with the provider.."
good,"Typical day at work can be challenging from time to time you are expected to complete sertain projects and programs at given time frame.The work culture I would say it is great it is a company that support you through out wether you are from a different racial background, your appearance ect."
good,I enjoyed my time here. I had the opportunity to meet some great people. Not only that I had the opportunity to advance in the company while there. I went from Customer Service Specialist to Team Lead to Acting Supervisor (while my immediate supervisor was out on family leave).
good,"Typical day at work was pretty much routine. However, if a change occurred it would either be advised a long time prior to it becoming effective or a the very last minute with the expectation to execute without the requirements being fully laid out thoroughly in reference to what was abruptly being changed."
good,"My last job was in Human Resources.  Each day had  its challenges.  A typical day consisted of completed my manager's in basket work left from the day before, reviewed new applicants resumes and scheduled interviews.  I learned how to multitask and extensive computer skills like power point and excel.   The hardest part of the job was trying to get everything done in one day.  I did learn to excel in multitasking which was a plus in getting the work done.  Most of the managers excelled in their jobs and were well liked by their employees.  Employees worked hard but were well compensated.  Morale was fair, once more people were laid off, more work had to be done with less people.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet many people who came in the office to be interviewed plus becoming friends with many of the folks I worked with.  I retired in 08.  Would like to work part time in a job I enjoy to get out of the house and earn extra money."
good,ik deed vanalles en het was erg gezellig met een heel erg goed loon.
good,"It's an OK place to work. For myself, it was much better than what I previously had, was a no brainer to jump at this opportunity when I saw it. The most enjoyable part is being able to have that feeling of accomplishment from helping somebody solve an issue. Worst part is when you get blamed for doing something that you don't even have the power to do in the company and getting unnecessary backlash when it is not warranted in any way, shape or form. The management for the most part is very good, granted the way things are ran.. is sometimes questionable, I've learned quite a bit about health care and the different types of accounts it offers since I've been there and a typical day at work is pretty stressful. If it's one thing you will learn about a job like this.. Patience is absolute KEY. If you do not have patience, this is not the field for you."
good,The daily job is like maintaining web services of their photo enforcement projects. There is also an Indian team so needs to work with them. The work/life balance is good.
good,"El ambiente laboral fue cordial porque era una empresa muy pequeña, aproximadamente unos 20 empleados, tenía las herramientas de trabajo y el horario era completo con dos horas para comer, solo que fue por muy poco tiempo lo que laboré porque no me gustó, mis actividades al principio estaban enfocadas a la venta y después cambiaron ."
good,En la empresa se maneja mucho por la llamada palanca y amistades. Todo esto por encima del desempeño del mismo asesor.
good,Once was a great company and is trying to be great again.Recently split into two companies. This should allow management to focus on the core business.
good,Technical support for Apple customer service. one thing i can say is the customers are amazing you may have some irrate customers at times but that comes with the job. being able to assist customers with there products on simple technical issues. The call flow at times was very harsh special when new products came out and updates came along. over all a fun and great job just think those amazing customer service agents should be getting paid more.
good,Xerox bied de mogelijkheid je zelf te ontwikkelen in voornamelijk groepsverband en communicatie. Ze bieden communicatie cursussen wat goed van pas komt. Daarnaast krijg je ook de mogelijkheid kennis te maken met verschillende programmatuur dat goed van pas komt als je de IT kant op wilt.
good,"xerox is a good place to work and also build you for other customer service jobs this working environment opened my mind to know i am a good customer service representative and made me know i could work under pressure even though the management was not all that good was a great place to work what i had love about the job is that i get to communicate with people from all over daily, each day working with xerox had it good and bad times."
good,With engineering and Research and Development all farmed out to overseas third party companies Xerox struggles to reinvent itself into a services based business. If Service is your calling than this might be the business for you.
good,This job is a call center job. The rules are very strict and lunches are only 30 mins. It is full time and the pay is great for someone who doesn't have a whole lot going on or has never worked full time. The work load can be overwhelming when it gets busy. It feels like you don't get enough time to think about anything.
good,"I was responsible for a $1.5 dollar marketing Outsourced Print Budget."
good,"Little to no experience required for new hirees, too much employee turn around. Nice place to work, all things considered."
good,"Een van mijn sterke punten is dat ik de klanten goed kan overtuigen om pakketten te verkopen. Vragen naar de behoefte van de klant is heel erg belangrijk. Kan mij goed in de plek van de klant zetten en de juiste pakket aanbieden. Soms gaat het niet alleen om verkoop, als klanten ontevreden zijn probeer ik eerst een oplossing te vinden waarmee de klant eerst tevreden wordt om daarna een verkoop te kunnen doen. Verkoop is mijn ding. Klanten die het niet willen weet ik toch overtehalen.  "
good,the sprint campaign was a breeze and loved working for the company. i wish sprint never left. great benefits can have better staff and managers
good,"I like the people that work there and the management is good, no room for growth at this time, the pay isn't bad but the health insurance is not great at all"
good,informeel bedrijf die creatief is om zijn medewerkers gemotiveerd te houden. minder salaris wel goed te combineren met studie of gezin
good,I took this role to see if I could make it in corporate America. The job was working side by side with the client. I was the only employee from the company on site. The role was challenging.
good,"Mijn dagelijkse taken bestonden uit:"
good,"productive and satisfying workplace, enjoying assisting the providers and insurance carriers with members claims, benefits and eligibility"
good,"I worked at Xerox part- time and full-time. It was an excellent place to develop my skills.  There was a professional environment with plenty of training in new sales techniques. "
good,"It is fine working at xerox in madison, ms."
good,Fast pace very demanding. a lot of things to accomplish in short time period. coworkers were fun to work with made things a lot easier. the hardest part of the job was walking and pulling a cart all day
good,"Xerox was a well paying job, with a clean and professional environment. the hardest part about the job was finding he correct resources on the system, and handling angry customers."
good,I had so much fun to work with the team. The management support and help us to develop our skills and improve our knowledge when it comes to innovation. Encoding sensitive information such as PHI (Personal Health Information) is risky because our priority is to protect our client’s information. We ensure the security and confidentiality of our clients from the big Health Insurance Company all over the world. As the company grew the more opportunities come.
good,making sure customers are satisfied with resolving issues they have with Verizon. the representative must be professional and courteous
good,"Major company that seems to not really invest time and money into finding the appropriate employees for the positions. Overall the company is a great company, the site/location where I worked was not the best simply because the management team made the experience horrible. Hostile environment, open door policy open but will be exposed through gossip and rumors."
good,Fast pace but fulfilling in helping to resolve issues and assisting customers. Great and fun co-workers and supervisor.
good,You have to be use to and enjoy change becasue there is CONSTANT change at Xerox. You can always be switched to different departments
good,"this job was an productive environment ,I did appreciate that their goal , which was to connect with their cutomers ,although my skills for this job were challenged ,I did improved in areas I feel that I lacked in ."
good,"it,s a great place to work,sometimes its very competitive.the work isn,t too hard the training staff is superb.if you apply yourself you can advance up in the company"
good,"helaas is het project  van Samsung bij xerox afgelopen "
good,"A typical work day consist of logging into the phones and assisting the Medicare members with question concerning their policies. I have learned to have patients with others and how to multitask."
good,"It was a good job, it had great benefits and it had a lot of hours for you to work including a lot overtime. You helped customers with there products but it was easy it just had to be done in a timely manner. I learned how to handle customers better and how to calm customers down when theyre really frustrated. The managers were ok, the coworkers were ok, the hardest part was trying to resolve peoples issues quickly, the most enjoyable part of the job for me was clocking out and going home and receiving a nice check."
good,"The work is good and most of the people are too. The Ceo unfortunately doesnt reward loyalty or good work and holds back information. There is also loads of safety hazards that ae never fixed but merely ""bandaged""."
good,"I learned to process pension benefits and the reasons to detail documents for accuracy."
good,"The job overall was a fair job. You learned the ins and outs of insurance and customer care swiftly, yet efficiently. Your coworkers and can range from extremely friendly to too personal. The hardest part of the job is understanding that the participants whether frustrated or happy are calling to be helped."
good,"if you like phones this is the job for you, lower bosses are ok but upper management is a joke. Attendance is very laid back, only real beni........"
good,"Xerox was one of the greatest learning experiences of my life, while I did not particularly enjoy some aspects of the job I always got a feeling of satisfaction when successfully solving a customer's issue or keeping them with the company. Management was overall good but somewhat unprofessional at times, for example saying that they are 100 percent committed to helping agents but many times simply brushing questions and concerns off to work on other problems, and at times being very loud where customers on the phone can hear what they are saying, sometimes yelling across the room. New rules and policies were constantly being enforced and they always seemed unnecessary and to come without warning such as dress code changing out of the blue and having to use a tool in our system or risk getting terminated if we did not meet a certain percentage of how often we use the tool. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with irate customers and constantly being micro-managed by supervisors, every action that you made and every word that you say was recorded and that put extra stress on the agents. Overall it was a very good learning experience and pay was great but I simply felt that this job was not for me."
good,"a typical day would be answering calls for members about plan benefit information, and providing details for the mail order pharmacy"
good,"Through out the night all you do is Process or scan a check, once its put in the database its ready to be keyed and reviewed. The things I've learned about my job is to try to keep a clear head when the work becomes a overload and the pressure is on to meet deadline."
good,"well not all call center are perfect. however, this one in particular is one unique call center that will blow your mind away. if you ever call about tolls and unpaid violations, this is the best call center to call that will provide you information about your license plate and toll collections. none-the less, everyone here at work are very vibrant. most call centers are just as weird and nerdy. this call center is very hip and modern. other than that, if the company had a better enthusiastic energy to encourage other co workers to understand rules and regulations from our client and better yet keep our work ethics professional. "
good,A typical day of work would be that we would enter sate taxes in for the state of louisiana and you would be responsible for your own work at your own pace. The hardest part of the job would be just staying awake because you would be staring a computer screen all day and the most enjoyable part of the day is that you never had anyone staring over your shoulder. I loved my coworkers I'm a people's person and I can get along with anyone.
good,"From the time your shift begins till the end there is never a slow time which for me is a huge plus I like to stay busy constantly. I really enjoyed talking to all kinds of people from around the country, I made some new friends quick in the office everyone was so friendly and down to earth."
good,I worked for the same account for most of my career. I have personal relationships with my customers and my team is my extended family. My manager has known me for many years and I have always made sure to meet and exceed his expectations. I make sure my customers are taken care of without supervision. I stay on task until all projects are complete. I enjoy my interactions with my different customers and the differents types of projects placed in my care.
good,"I did enjoy working here and the pay was great. I was responsible for assisting customer with their bills, accounts. it was a very fast past environment and i defiantly learned how to move quickly but effectively on the job."
good,its a nice place to work the only down side its temp. The pay great people are nice and overall its a great place to work
good,"I worked as a Enterprise Car Rental Center taking overflow calls not received by the local branches.  This was temporary due to a seasonal need.  I logged onto the phone and the computer and waited for phone calls.  Mornings were usually long with phone calls far apart.  In the afternoon, calls were usually back to back, or close. I dealt with a lot of frustrated customers who wanted to speak to their local branch.  Sometimes I couldn't provide the answers customers wanted resulting in angry consumers, some were insulting."
good,"Great place to wrok, High pace of call turn arounds, Need to understand the system to go forward, Support from team leaders and management is provided is you are stuck in anything"
good,"A typical call center. "
good,This was great place to work. Great environment. I would have stayed if it were not for my commute.
good,I was always happy about how great the work environment was at Xerox. Friendly staff and willing to work with their employees.
good,"Fast paced environment"
good,"A typical day at work would be, normally go into work, set down at your desk, and start taking phone calls. For this being my 1st real stable job, I learned ALOT. How to empathize with people, understanding customers situations, and most of all delivering the worlds best customer service. The management was your typical management crew. If you needed assistance with a phone call, you would normally not find any management, but with my great coworkers we all worked as a team. If I didn't have an answer to my customers question, I know who would. Management was just there to see if we were doing our jobs. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you help your customer out successfully and give them peace of mind that everything was taken care of, and knowing that they only had to call ONCE to get things straightened out. Also that YOU were the one to make an impact on their mood. It just makes you feel like you were there not just to do a job, but to help people out when they have now idea whats going on."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,I had some great leaders at my establishment. There is not much opportunity to advance and the work is too redundant. The atmosphere is relax and you can leave your work at home. Its a great position for a student or someone looking to come out of retirement and do something not to stressful.
good,"It was an good place to start when you just finish university. However in the SJ center, you could bounce around laterally, but no many truly different roles. There have been many lay off, so don't think that you will retire with this company. "
good,at this job im on the phone all day i love talking to people on the phone thats why i like this job i learned mostly about medicare insurences and how they work  i think the hardest part of this job is being patient with the people that call being angry at just have to breath and take the call as calm as you can
good,"A typical day at work for me would be fly by due to call volume."
good,"Foi uma ótima empresa para início de carreira, começei como auxiliar de produção e cheguei a operador de produção III liderando alguns contratos de prestação de serviços."
good,I acquired great skills that directly relates to customer service and the retail environment.
good,"There were usually a quick briefing, and then you are expected to commence with your duties. Most sites were located at law firms, and it is a first come first serve basis. You need to know everything on site.  Ipro, LAW, and eDiscovery. The management was hands off till something went wrong, which was good. The hardest part of the job was balancing the law firm personnel and the people I supervised. The most enjoyable part of the day was completing all tasks, and having time to breth and plan and setup the shop for the next day."
good,"Strong organizational structure and culture."
good,"Amplias posibilidades de desarrollo, crecimiento personal dependiendo de las propias metas alcanzable, faltante de manejo en relaciones interpersonales en cuando a los lideres con los empleados(agentes), en contraposición e la cultura, misión y valor de la empresa ."
good,customer service for sams club data entry and a soft selling (top down selling)
good,"With management that did a great job of directing and insulating developers, I enjoyed almost complete focus on the projects I completed at Xerox. My co-workers were friendly and cooperative when assisting each other."
good,"It became very stressful but the supervisors were always there to try and brighten up the day with music. They would dance around and when a person received a perfect survey, they would get to play games for a few minutes."
good,sprint customer service is a dificult job purely because of the verbal abuse you receive daily from customers.
good,"Answer phone calls from verizon wireless customers, and assist with trouble shooting skillis. Learned customer service skills, management & co-workers were pretty laid back & very professional. Hardest part was not knowing what was realy wrong with the device we were trying to trouble shoot. Enjoyable part would be hearing the customers voice of tone of being excited when their devices are correctly trouble shooted and they can enjoy their device."
good,"The pay plans make it impossible to achieve the max amount of money one can make. So management is really the biggest issue people get in high positions who don't posses the proper qualities. Nonetheless, I learned how a call center works and how to deal with impatient customers, I actually enjoyed the customer to customer service rep interaction. The hardest part of my job was denying service."
good,"No soy una persona muy social, y la mayoría de las personas dependen mucho de lubricantes sociales o fiestas. Lo cual es normal, pero si no te sabes desenvolver en ese entorno, no estableces relaciones con casi ninguna persona o grupo."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working here.  I felt appreciated and valued.  Sometimes it felt like other departments depended on the department I worked in, however, it was worth feeling valued as an employee."
good,"Xerox provide good work culture, and in xerox we have training for employees, team meeting and fun activities. Xerox provide good facilities for employees."
good,Xerox was my first call center to work in. It was a good experience and fun to learn. I enjoyed giving customer support. The pay was fair but they offered good benefits.
good,This position will definitely pull at your heart strings and morals. if you love engaging with people from all walks of life you will like this position.
good,Clean new work space.  My manager was great and fair.  We worked hard but also had time for jokes and having some fun.  It was a fun group of people that we worked with.
good,Been here 7 years this job needs a union there is no cost of living raise you can be held back from transferring to another dept if your valued but if you can tolerate being alone for hours this is a great job
good,Top management slow to recognize industry trends causing poor long term performance. The the cutting your way to profitability is not a long term solution. They have some really great technology but fail to market it. Very suprising considering how much technical depth the company has.
good,"While working here the employer assigned me a  handicapped parking, and took the spot back.  I used a walker. This left me feeling vulnerable and unsafe."
good,You have your assigned work and you do the work until you are finished. Relaxed environment with plenty of work to do. Manager was always willing to listen to input on how to be more efficient.
good,Xerox has many employees willing to assist with parts and technical support. Management is always available as is technical support when needed. Company meeting to ensure that everyone is working from the same book. Great documentation for fixing machines.
good,"It was an all right place to work, most of the managers went above and beyond what was necessary. The job was not stressful or overwhelming and they took into consideration employees family life."
good,"At the start of the day I would attend a  training classes , I learned a lot about the cable industry and how to handle customers on the phone. The hardest part of the job was trying to picture customers situations over the phone ."
good,The work load is impossible to do.  Objectives are unrealistic & can't be achieved with 40 hours. A lot of great people to work with. Managers are usually available to assist if you need them to.
good,"Was a great place to work but in recent years with so many cut backs it wasn't as fun. Co-workers are great, management was okay.  Good work life balance but pay wasn't good, company isn't keeping up with competition in that regards."
good,"Great company to work for, they have great medical insurance, continuous training so you stay up to date with information, and offers overtime. The one area  I would like to see improve is the supervisors being able to stay with their team for longer periods. My supervisor seemed to always be changing. Another improvement I think could occur is the pay. This is contracted through Apple and there is enough money to pay employees more for their expertise."
good,"This job is really stressful. If you can deal with rude, disrespectful customers and people always upset about their bill and service then by all means try it out. I did not like this position at all."
good,Xerox was a great experience taking inquiry calls helping customers with insurance policy making sure payments are made on time taking calls back to back and the fact that customers was satisfied with your assistance gave pleasure in assisting
good,"The job is hard work, constantly on the phone dealing with customers.These customers are more often than not angry and confused about their phones. There is a pretty extensive training period of about 12 weeks but that doesn't really prepare you at all and there is little to no support while on the call floor."
good,"environment is good and pleasant. fun committee and work recognisation is there. Xerox is good place to work. "
good,"great company but managers dont help with anything, supervisors can care less about anything except you making good quality scores so that they can get their bonuses"
good,"Good company to work for.  Polite and professional workforce.  "
good,"taking inbound calls from customers needing tech support for cable boxes, scheduling appointments for technicians, if needed, and up sell on cable products and services that were offered."
good,"A typical day at Xerox Inc consisted of taking calls, booking cruises for multiple cruise lines, using multiple web pages and booking tools, creating and changes preexisting passenger profiles, processing payments, and adding promotions to bookings. I took away a lot of great lessons from Xerox including time management, sales techniques, and how to properly use multiple web pages at once to answer questions and solve issues. The hardest part of working at Xerox was finding productive uses of your time during the slow periods, which could last months. The best part of being a customer service associate was booking cruises. There was nothing better then working asking questions to proposing your tailored offer and then adding that initial payment, it's amazing."
good,Management can abuse their authority. They can be unfair and misleading. Some will throw a rock and hide their hand. The benefits and union are two of the best aspects about work there.
good,"All around a great place to work, if i were to suggest any changes it would be in the upper management level and better help for new sales associates. It is a revolving door policy that they need to change by focusing on current reps, helping them master their skills to succeed not setting them up for to fail"
good,I worked with a great team of people. The department I worked with was very interesting and very rewarding. The company saw the value of my team and the others we worked with.
good,I learned how to manage accounts and assist customers with troubleshooting. Assist customers with learning how to manage their own accounts. Keeping a constant workflow.
good,"The work environment is great and management is very savvy and helpful....always available and truthful...good place to work, clean interior, well equipped and everyone very friendly, not to mention the available eating establishments within a 5 minute dri"
good,"The only thing wrong was the job wasnt for me "
good,"Cómo transnacional e innovadora de tecnológica y siempre a la Vanguardia del desarrollo de soluciones , y con mucha presencia en el mercado local en empresas de primer nivel."
good,"Uma empresa boa de se trabalhar."
good,"Esta empresa se caracteriza por tener buen hambiente de trabajo, trabajo en equipo, ben horario y sueldo. "
good,A great company to build in however they do have a lot of mistakes that need to be tended to. Also there needs to be more care for the employees so that they feel appreciated.
good,"Pretty busy, but fast pace environment. The management was ok half were really fun and could learn a lot from and some didn't care as much. Co workers built like a family environment. Hardest part was not being able to set up new service and save customers money because of where they live. Different contest they had to make extra money"
good,Working 40+ hours a week is nice for the pocketbook but when you have a special needs child it doesn't work very well for you. Management wasn't so great at this position and that is one of the reasons I finally decided to leave the company. I liked the job I was doing but the company doesn't seem to care about their employees that much.
good,answering multiple of calls everyday speaking to different people all over the united states. the money is great also with great benefits. The pay is very great love the environment and the coworkers. I have learned quit a bit if handling different customers.
good,"My review of Xerox State Healthcare, LLC would be a good company to work for.This company has taught me a lot about how our Department of Health Care Services implements the rules and policies of CA Medicaid also known as ""Medi-Cal"" program. I learned and understand their billing rules for claims and billing system for all contracted providers. Recently I have taken on projects requested by our client, the Department of Health Care Services as an outbound call agent. I reach out to the billing providers and advise them on various reason why claims are denied or suspended and how to resolve these issues. I also call to the beneficiaries and helped them resolve their issues. Hardest part of my day is not able to get in contact with certain providers to give them the information in order to help them with their suspended claims. I like the culture and environment. Everyone is professional with each other and I am able to communicate with my superiors if I have an issue or suggestions."
good,"Great job, not so good paid, but OK for a while."
good,"My first call center job ever. But, there was so much missing that I did not learn from training and the company itself was just a MESS!"
good,"Loud environment depending on your supervisor, Sometimes very unprofessional, some very nice people do work there though do not get me wrong it's just the environment is very weird. Unexpected things happen there all the time. All in all there's the fun days then there are the days where everybody being loud and stuff just gets to you."
good,"I took a leap on a new career, knowing that there would be training, for this job.   There is no training, and a"" just do it"" method."
good,"there is a lot of information to take in. it my seem overwelming at time but once you get the hang of it the job is cool . the trainers always aroung gine you help when yoou need it,"
good,working for this company had its ups and downs required a lot but pay wasn't the best. Management needed to be better at times
good,Xerox has a lot of opportunities to grow inside the company. The company is not that professional in attire. But learned a lot about Verizon wireless while working there
good,"A typical day was quiet, and just the sounds of the keyboard; fast working environment. It was very secured, CO-Workers were bias towards others. The managers were very unprofessional, they just believed what was said out someone else mouth, but they paid really good. The hardest part about working there is not being treated the same. The enjoyable part was I got to listen to music to tone others."
good,work with xerox was a good opportunity an its help me to get more knowledge on my customer service skill . it was fun an the staff are real respectful.
good,"I liked that they took the time to train for 3 weeks, but when I had asked for additional training, I kept getting told they would take care of it. Weeks would go by and I had asked my supervisor for additional help. Even went to HR! Nothing was done so my scores were low! As an employee trying to represent the company, I felt I should have gotten the help I needed instead of being pushed to the side. I enjoyed my coworkers very much otherwise."
good,My work day at Xerox started busy and ended busy. The work environment is very fast paced. the call volume is very high. I learned that time management is very important in the customer service environment. You have to be willing to learn new ideas and be  able to work in a versatile work setting. Being a team player is the key to success. The hardest part of the job is explaining to the customers that their benefits have expired and the most important and enjouyale part of the job is customer satisfaction.
good,My co workers are very friendly and very supportive.We can depend on any at the times of emergencies.Working environment is stress free. I really enjoy my Job. As the job environment is good am able to give cent percent commitment to my work. I am able to maintain a good relation ship with our clients in Spain as I work as an AP associate for SPAIN
good,"This company seems to be a good stable place to work from site to site however there is no room for growth , no benefits."
good,Xerox as a company is good but Sprint is hired by Xerox and Sprints constant change and demand is hard to keep up with. There are a lot of sales included which is not explained when you take the job.
good,"From the time I left the training room and hit the production floor I felt ready to take on the customers, I left training feeling confident, and it showed in my performance. I maintained all 9-10's on my quality assurance customer surveys and never had a dull day. "
good,"Een dag op het werk was net als een dag met vrienden."
good,"es una muy buena empresa para laborar,  basicamente es contactar a los clientes para venderles el banda ancha son muy estrictos con los horarios de entrada"
good,"I really liked my co-workers, we got along really well"
good,"fact past , good work environment , customer service friendly"
good,"My favorite part of this job was working with the customers.  Resolving  their issues.  I enjoyed the challenge of resolving the problems they were having with their phones. I enjoyed the challenge of calming down an angry customer so I could resolve their issue.  I enjoy working with people.  I believe that everyone deserves respect and should be treated with care. I maintained a rep-resolve rating  of ""10"" and ""yes"" for 5 months at a time, with not less then 98 percent in other months. I was able to manage the accounts, take payments and resolve minor technical issues. I learned so much about how cell phones worked and how towers worked.   I felt the company did not allow adequate time for what some customers needed for great customer service.  The employees and management were friendly and easy to work with."
good,"Xerox is my second company and still with Xerox at present."
good,"i would take calls all day, and i would honestly learn something new about the credit world everyday.My co-workers although they have been working longer than i have are very helpful. It really is a team effort. Management was great, but none of them provided the same information to questions. For example, if a customer had a question that i could not answer i would have to ask a supervisor. That one supervisor would give me an answer to tell the customer but the company that reviewed the calls would say I gave the customer the wrong information. But if i ask another supervisor they would be able to give me correct information. So none of the same level supervisors would not be on one accord. There are bonuses that you can earn each month but you can never get a raise no matter how long you work their. You can make suggestions but the only change that can be made is only for the customers not for the company.We never got the updates on time either"
good,Layered application development with multiple dependent systems. Integrating testing was the hardest part of the job. Better understanding on Healthcare domain knowledge.
good,es una empresa buena pues si me retire fue por motivos de salud
good,"rotina de trabalho agradável e tranquila, bons superiores, e otimos funcionários.."
good,"the company is great when it comes to the quality of people who work with you, and the opportunities you are given, but benefits are lower compared to most other companies"
good,I love working at Xerox but we just found out that our largest client has been hiring FTEs and will be replacing each of us. Our other projects are fully staffed. I work in the Healthcare Solutions group. There could be some new opportunities but it's a little scary now. I'm looking for a long term opportunity preferably working in healthcare IT or a new FTE management position in Healthcare IT. 
good,Everyday was a new day to meet with expectations and add values as a team player and individual.
good,Great company to start with. Making changes to move in the right direction
good,Typical work day is checking emails then solving any problems of the emails. Start working on accounts assigned to.
good,"It's a nice place to work until the downsizing.  Giving one on ones to the agents was fun, me allng with them enjoyed the feedback provided.  The cons were the hours of operation."

Management was awesome laid back. Workplace was laid back. Dealing with Difficult customers was the hardest part of my job. Most enjoyable party of my job i was off at 3pm in the afternoon.
good,"Buena empresa dediccada a las ventas por call center excelentes horarios, facilidad de estudio y crecimiento, buen ambiente laboral"
good,"It's a relaxed atmosphere with very flexible scheduling but the workers are not team players. Management only gives work to the ones that will do it, the others don't learn enough to know how to do the work."
good,"Call center atmosphere, training with your POD once a week, a lot of overtime around holidays, flexible schedules, opportunity to move up, Management still needs work"
good,My colleagues were great to work with.  They were passionate about their area of research and talented.  My immediate managers were supportive and encouraging.
good,dealt with customers having issues with products via telephone. Was my first attempt at a desk job and really not my forte. The people were nice and my manager was amazing.
good,"This is a great contracted Job. Xerox is a great company to work for, and have job security. the work day is form 8:00am till 4:30pm Monday threw Friday. due to Xerox being a contract company you are sent to a different company to work. management does inter act with you and answer any question you have and listen to an concerns that you have."
good,"Overall it was a good job if you don't mind sitting at a computer and talking to people over the phone about their services. The beginning of working there you have to go through 12 weeks of training, unfortunately I moved while employed here and had to resign 5 weeks in."

good,"Xerox sales training is unlike any I have ever experienced. "
good,"The people at this workplace made me feel real uncomfortable due to the fact that I am not originally from Mississippi. I really felt like it was an easy job, with great benefits, as well as, great pay. However, I ultimately decided to leave due to the very, negative atmosphere of the workplace."
good,"productive and fun work place.. the conpensation was great , however helping claimaints was better...... greaqat place to work for"
good,"Usual Job process."
good,Pretty good place to work. Take incoming calls as a customer service representative for Sprint. Lots of room to grow and move up. Some calls were stressful and some were very pleasant and easy. My supervisor was very helpful and made the job a lot easier than other supervisors did for their teammates. The hardest part of the job was meeting the sales goals and handling the stress of some customers yelling at me.
good,"Great place to work but stressful work environment, 30 minute lunches, and management always being on your back made it horrible to work there"
good,"professional and a comfortable work environment, the company was on the rise at the time with a high pace environment and competitive in naturel great leadership and elite tutelage."
good,place to work. alwayas busy and the job itsself was easy to work around your shift with being enrolled in school. would recommend to just about anyone
good,Worked with a lot of great people. learned a lot from them to help me advance in my pursuits and the path I wanted to take at the time.
good,"great work hours and flexibility, great and fun co workers, great advancement options, fun days like hat day and wacky color day."
good,you learn how to search through a huge data base to find answers to questions customers have. the most in enjoyably part of the job is getting that thank you. i would say the hardest is when you can not help the customer even thoe you really wants to
good,"The network operations center was an extremely fast paced, technical specific, environment. Proactive response time to any outages was very critical. The enterprise network itself was huge with nodes in most of the countries worldwide, built on a Cisco platform. All critical alerts monitored were in excess of 77,000 daily. There were four major data centers in the United States and two in Europe. Very challenging job."
good,A typical day at Xerox is taking inbound phone calls and taking care of the customer and troubleshooting problems and going over billing. My co-workers are very knowledgeable and helpful. I learned alot at my job and a learn something new everyday. What i enjoy the most about my job is the room to move up in the company.
good,"Any job can be stressful, but when there are things that needs to be taken care of i don't fill as if the company supports and make me comfortable are secure that they do care."
good,helped me find a job that i adore and also perfect scheduling
good,productive and great customer care by answering the phone. like to work around others.
good,"As a developer at Xerox, a typical day includes: fixing bugs or ""incidents"", and updating old code. Once in a while, you'll be placed on a project where you will be creating something from scratch (but also using our existing framework)."
good,It was a overall nice company to work with but things got kind of shaky at the end of the contract.
good,I personally loved working here for the 2 1/2  years I was part of the team. I learned how to manage my own time develop strong team and leadership quality's  however the company made a lot of changes and is setting it self and employees for failure
good,"Everyday is a new day.  Working with people is my passion.  I'm friendly, energetic, and dedicated. "
good,"Fruitful environment, Welll cultured company, had a goo team where everyone take care of each other, where your question doesn't go unanswered."
good,Job was very diversified. Company is willing to help accomplish your goals. Fostered a Team approach.
good,"Pessoas maravilhosas, gerencia muito boa e competente.Parte dificil de trabalho era ir a pé para a empresa."
good,"Xerox is a wonderful atmosphere to learn all about sales. Managers are trained to mentor Account Executives. The most difficult part of the job is selling value. Competitiors were cheaper, but the products Xerox had were quality-based machines. The team-work spirit was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,wounderful people to work with. very understanding people who thought me alot.
good,"This is a good in-between or a starter job. You will have to fight for your work-life balance. But once they realize that you are serious, they will then ensure that you have a schedule that works for you. It is a performance-based company. As long as you perform well your schedule will remain suitable. They could stand to pay a bit more for the customer service job. It paid the bills so I couldn't complain much."
good,"This job was very challenging, and also very flexible. I really enjoyed working for the company. would recommend this company to anyone. Also the company had great training tools."
good,the building we were in was infested with bed bugs every few days. and when i needed a few days off because of my sons surgery he was having they threatened to fire me if i missed work.
good,"•	Provides basic troubleshooting on iOS devices for the customers and maintains customer iTunes Store account."
good,Typical day at work is talking to customers. Some were mean some were nice. Always had some sort of potluck or company thing. Sometimes get a little time off of the phones. Rotated the teams to get that done. They do work within the company as of advancements.  It was nice. If you didn't or couldn't commit to what you promise during coaching then it eventually would be a problem. They coach you to better your skills & what you do wrong or could do better.
good,"Buena remuneración."
good,The job is very stressful and management doesn't help you at all. The training for the job doesn't pertain to anything you are going to run into on the phone. The material is confusing and not user friendly
good,Working at Xerox was definitely an unforgettable experience that was enjoyable as much as it could be. The hours were long but the job was fun and competitive.
good,"The job is easy. The benefits and the pay is good. However, the management could be a lot better. I worked their pregnant. I had an emergency that resulted in an overnight stay at the hospital. I came back to work with discharge papers and a doctors note, the lady in charge marked me as a ""no call/no show"" and i have not been able to apply ever since"
good,lo que aprendi mejora de usar el sistema de facturacion oracle
good,I enjoyed the call center and customer service however I feel as though I would not benefit from a full time position here. This job is more of like a stepping stone
good,"I worked with a group of great people, but they don't give raises in my position. And continuously add more responsibility. But the people are nice..."
good,"Great company, opportunity to advance and great people"
good,"Nice work/family balance."
good,"Working at Xerox was a really good place to work at, I learned all different types of things that I never knew about, only thing that I thought was unfair was they are a very strict company to work for."
good,a typical day at work I log in and set up my computer and start taking calls. I mingle with my co-workers in between calls and continue my day at work.
good,Taking calls for customers. Helping taking care of all customers phone issues. Helping with the new systems.
good,Early working day with a nice ending time. Great co-workers. Management is great and will handle any problem or concern with care and prompt.
good,"Xerox was a productive ,cool job to wrk...you can wear whateva long as its not revealing, cool ppl to wrk with nice pay. The only certain managers need to wrk on is COMMUNICATION."
good,Typical day started at 7 am. Work placed on desk and ready to go. Job very easy to comprehend. Love to use my data entry skills. Management very helpful and supportive.
good,Pienso que todo se basa en un buen ambiente laboral para poder generar y producir más cada día
good,Management is awesome. Coworkers are great to be around while in training the trainers are great teachers. You'll learn so much within your experiencing this call center job.
good,"xero has great benefits, theres always room for professional growth, the co-workers are friendly and helpful, but the hardest thing about working there is that you have to have a backbone and handle customer slander in a friendly professional manner and not let your emotions get in the way. I couldn't handle it but its a very good place to work. great benefits and even better pay."
good,"If someone is looking for a job where they could advance quickly and get taught as they move up in a company, this would be a perfect fit! To move up in this company depends on your own pace and dedication. The money is great, and the employees are easy to get along with."
good,Got to experience DIFFERENT formats within the sales department and also got self confidence to be able to achieve targets and go for more.The trainings nat Xerox were something to look forward as they stressed on personal growth
good,"Great Way to start workiong in a multinational company"
good,Great place to work! Wonderful leadership and provided additional learning opportunities to enhance your skill sets. Always had the support of management.
good,"work from 7 to 430 m-f  Work for Xerox for 15 years, enjoyed working there.  I learned how  to work with people. Exceptional Customer Support Skills.  Strong analytical, with problem solving and researched capabilities. Positive and proactive attitude.           The hardest part of work was being mutative to move up in the  company. Not a lot of opening available."
good,it is nice laid back everyone was really friendly hardest part I would say is dealing difference type of question witch became easy over time
good,Overall the jobs ia great place for starters and there ia alot of room for advancement. The only thing I think needs to be improved is the attendance policy
good,Oportunidad de crecimiento y de hacer tiempo extra y ganar bonos. Poco estresante tratando con los clientes que llamaban pero por lo general las llamadas no eran tan difícil. Un día típico era estar al tanto de los números del día anterior al igual a los del mes.
good,This job was very stressful. Most of management has a nasty attitude. Most higher ups never want to assist. The company really needs some re-evaluation & major inspection.
good,"A typical day for me was different than for others because I actually loved my job, whereas most do not. That is the only great thing I can say about it. I truly loved my job and I loved all the agents. Working with them was the best part of every day. Gaining their trust and knowing they looked to me for help and answers was the greatest feeling. "
good,Lots of customer service with this job. Assisting customers with questions regarding their account was the main thing I did.
good,"Nice place too work my co-workers are easy too get along with ,my supervisor is easy going he doesn't  ride my back ,the hardest part of my job is making sure my clients is satisfied"
good,I love the hours and benefits of working here. The things I wish would change is them being more organized. It would be better if they paid for as well. It was a bit stressful working here.
good,"ok place to work at. Great co workers, just need to have two straight days off instead of split days off. "
good,"My overall rating of Xerox is that the company just need to be a little more organized and on time with important information that their agents have to know. Management should also be a little more respectful than they are. I also believe that if management expects us and want us as agents to follow the rules and give us a document to sign to follow them, they should also follow those rules as well. They also cancel our breaks and we have to sit there for about 10 hours without a lunch break, yes they will provide us with lunch but we have to eat between calls. I feel that anywhere you are employed you are entitled to a 30 minute lunch break under no circumstances. My co-workers ar every helpful at times, we try to help one another, but there is management do not want us talking at all not even to help one another with a question if so that's a written. The most enjoyable of my job is basically talking to the customers."
good,"Xerox is not a bad place to work, but there are no raises once you are on the production floor, unless you go for management. A couple of my managers said that being in production, more money could be made. My problems with Xerox were that I had a medical condition that required I have extra time than at breaks or meals. I had to sign out of work, take care of things, then sign back in to work. I would never get a full 8 hours per day, as those times I logged out would be taken off my time. Then there are the customers who like to yell,and degrade you, just because you're just a voice, and not a person in front of them."
good,The pay was great. The conditon where a little diffcult but nothing that a little use to and training couldnt help with. They are a growing company so they are pretty strict. But overall it was pretty ok
good,"Hard working but very political. Management more worried about their job security rather than the company/employee goals."
good,"Xerox is a very fast pace to work, but also allows you to interact with many different personalities. Also it teaches you patience and motivates you to develop yourself and you skills."
good,"I sat down at my desk, logged into my system and waiting for people to call in. I learned that people can be as awful on the phone as some people can be in person . Always be happy and cheerful with them. The management is good. They always helped when needed. The hardest part of the j ob was dealing with customers on the phone that I couldn't really help. The most enjoyable was talking with the co workers around me and being able to help people with their accounts."
good,"Good enougn for starters, you can consider it as a stable job. Needs more improvement for career development not in general but for specific LOB. Over all Good"
good,"My duties included receiving and tracking claims and appeals received from physicians, hospitals and clients. Determined which category the claim and appeal should be filed under.  Communicated with insurance company to determine if the claims should be paid and how much."
good,No comment at this time due to signed termination agreement.  Hardest part of job was the transition in getting it off-shored and training a replacement group.
good,"Xerox has very beautiful projects on hand, I feel blessed to be part of my team and process (Supply Chain Management - Procurement), Only if you have a will, determination, likes challenges on a daily basis, being responsible is what proves me good at work. You have good support and knowledge sharing is getting improved. Management is looking majorly for cost cutting features in all aspects as it is now common an all companies."
good,I would love to have a job that was more stable and took more care and concern for the employees
good,"Typical day at work in a call center, the job was easy but a little to laid back. Slow speed."
good,I learned a lot about networking and SQL server. Hardest part of the job is the company is in a constant cost cutting mode.
good,"How does the director of the company just up and leave? "
good,"used good to work here, but later a India company buy the department and manager teams and culture were changed, a lots of experience engineers left, there are more and more issues, new engineers can't fix issues."
good,"Conduent is a new and advancing company that has a large population of employees and a divers population at that. My person experience with Xerox was as followed. The company does not fully value their employees. Raises are not provided no matter how long you are with the company unless you have a tittle change which is not easy to obtain. Poor management in majority of the call center portion. The benefits alone provided to its employees will drain your paycheck especially if you have a family or more than one child. Career advancement is not the easiest thing to achieve nor is it likely while in your roll with the company unless you have some kind of college degree in your field of work. We are asked to work during hazardous weather conditions even while in a state of emergency. We are not compensated for this work either. A lot can change about Conduent/xerox in my opinion, but working here is the best way to make a decision if it is for you."
good,"you sit and answer inbound phone calls,when you do something wrong they pull you to the side and tell you about it. they tell you what you did wrong but do not show you how to fix the problem"
good,Efficient and productive love the staff and coworkers . Always worked as a team . Environment was clean and healthy . Very fast paced  always exciting to be greeted with respect
good,"Average work culture, need to revise the pay structure with some more professionals to be hired,pay structure is the most important factor why employee loose faith in organization."
good,"Entrei como terceirizado, a empresa não dava muita oportunidade pára efetivação!"
good,"The job itself is a good job. The various clients that a person may be placed on may require different things. I learned how to control my actions in regards to business. The management differs from client to client. A client may have micro-management issues within their team and it causes problems on that team, but another client may not have those issues, so their team runs smoothly. The pay is good, but the job is temporary, unless you are hired. The hardest part is not knowing when the company will be letting you go. The best part was the satisfaction of the customer when I was ablr to assist or get the assistance they needed."
good,"Wouldn't recommend working for this company, contract for company"
good,"Great management team to work with, wish the company was not splitting. This makes great employees nervous. I live close to my work location making for an easy commute."
good,"job security is not good there. constant change in managment, and what is needed. one day the focus will be handle time, and the next all they care about is customer service."
good,I had the opportunity to learn a lot of back office operations and understanding of P&L responsibilities and high-level management in a shorter amount of time than a typical company that would want you to wait set amounts of years to be able to advance.
good,"Moving to different areas over the course of the day when the pay was on piece rate not knowing how much I would make on a day to day basis. The management were not very communicative. Not enough training to do jobs that I was asked to do. Work instructions were never given."
good,"Busy consistent environment, always on the phones talking"
good,Very Productive workplace.  I take about 100 calls or more a day assisting clients of the Department of Children and Family Services of Louisiana.  The hardest part of my job is not being able to resolve a issue right away.  My co- workers are fun and I have a great Supervisor.
good,Má administração sem muitos benefícios má condições de trabalho
good,"LONG HARD DAY, different days. ok and some what different life style"
good,Great colleagues to work with!
good,Je n'ai rien a reproche a Xerox sauf le faute qu'il n'y a aucun plan de carrière.
good,Provided info for health insurance / claims/ prescriptions . Often felt stressed providing the coverage to those on fixed income knowing that there were no other options to provide.
good,"During my career at Xerox I've gained experience and expertise in the following area:"
good,"This company is not longer in business as an audio visual solution company.  It was sold while I was there."
good,"The key to securing your job is to be a quick learner and great at customer service.  You must be able to adjust to the ever changing structure, policies and demands of the environment"
good,the work was hard and not enjoyable long hours doing nothing and not making any money. I hated those job because how they would talk to us. they were so rude
good,"If you aren't willing to sit for long hours, this job is not for you! No personal items are allowed on desks. Head seat on at all times, unless off the floor."
good,"This was my very first job I've ever had.. I was very new to the working world,  But the staff and Employees I worked with had no issue teaching me and making sure I understood every job duty and what my purpose was on working there.  I really enjoyed picking out outfits and Dog wear for family's events or picture day.  Loved the clothes also."
good,Wasn't treated fairly. No opportunity to grow or move around. Manager had his favorites within the team. There wasn't much training provided. No communication.
good,job security even when you are one of the best employees is not guaranteed. managers seem to be great but supervisors are trained in the jobs that are performed by subordinates
good,"Temp. and I work with Enterprise company to help, and guide customers. This company have you multi-task with computer screen and prompts to do the job"
good,"una empresa familiar de la cual queja no tengo, con ambiente regular, muy pocas probalidades de crecer dentro de la empresa"
good,"Typical day involves answering calls pertaining to customer's billing and resolving issues pertaining to their statements, resolving their billing issues, end of cycle and reconciliations. I also took the payment after fixing the issue at hand."
good,"•	Responsible for staffing and managing 50 FTE member inbound contact center and all operational teams."
good,Lo que mas me gusto fue  dirigirme a mas de 20 representantes técnicos.
good,"A empresa apresenta um ótimo histórico de relacionamento empresa-funcionário. Apresenta ambiente agradável para o trabalho porém com alguns setores com clima organizacional não saudável para o exercício da profissão. Talvez em razão de seu atual quadro dentro do senário de mercado, não oferece bons salários e pouca oportunidade de desenvolvimento."
good,"I love working for this company, but i was looking for higher career goals. This company was very family oriented and lovable."
good,"We had xerox on our ID's and paychecks, other than that we did not really feel like a part of xerox until it was time to get a raise."
good,"Fast -paced environment."
good,"always printing aircraft manuals of both BOEING and AIRBUS for engineering department and sending them for finishing"
good,I learned how to multitask.
good,"If you want to have zero life outside of work, feel free to sign up. Mad crazy OT. Sat + Sun with no days off sometimes for 20 days straight. Sold to Fuji in 2015 and shut down USA operations costing all our jobs. 14years i was at xerox. 2001-2015"
good,"I had various jobs at Xerox, helped people with their medical claims, helped sort the mail, data entry on all kinds of medical claims, helped in other departments.  Loved my job, however a new manager took over, cut pay and i went downhill after that, I didn't care for her attitude and quit the job.  She was not a people person and I just could not work for her.  However, my old boss was great."
good,"Overall company was fair. Do not expect raises in this company. Required to work mandatory overtime every other weekend. Work every other holiday. Travel 100% of the day. Provided company vehicle tools, and cell phone."
good,Good 'stepping-stone' job.  Good to fill in until a better job could be secured. It could have continued to have been a very good job if management had kept their word at job placement and kept me as a trainer.
good,okay job for the pay but management is lacking trainers are very rude messy and biased but again  good for the pay  has been changed to addecco former employees may find it hard to work there again
good,The firm Xerox placed me was very supportive. It was a fast paced with a relaxing atmosphere. It such a treat to go into the office and help the people with their needs.
good,This position was fast paced and detail oriented.I received one month training which was very thorough. The training was instrumental with job performance.
good,Stay on top of everyone and your work as well the focus level needed is highly above normal but after a while your life will or should change to suit the other employees with their personal evinorment to create a working team
good,"People were very nice, decent and honest."
good,I was good at the job when I got sick there was no compassion they told me I could reapply once I got better but I've applied multiple times and no go so whateva I guess lol
good,"Trabalho contava com atendimento call center help desk"
good,"It is like most Benefits jobs but management expect you to take on additional responsibility with no added benefits or pay. For example I was a 401K Representative for a large company and after a decline in the Pension department, they sought to cross-train 401K representatives. After one month of training we began to ask questions about increase pay as our job description solely mentioned 401K benefits only. They stated no extra pay will be given as this is technically part of our job. We were severely underpaid for the amount of work we were given. Management seems non-existence even with constant meetings."
good,"Dahill is a fast-paced work environment.  Mostly, is an enjoyable experience however, management needs to be trained on how to be successful managers."
good,This place has the potential to be a great place to work. The job itself isn't super difficult. The place needs some TLC. There is nothing fun to do. Not enough room. No departments really speak to each other and it's kind of stifling.
good,"With 15 years of work for Xerox now Conduent, there has been very limited times when merit increases have been provided. Even when employees are doing their best to provide quality solutions with little unnecessary overtime."
good,I started out as a temp but became permanent. I loved the job and the training was very informational. The only downfall was i worked there for 3 years and never got a raise.
good,"Politically connected with the State Welfare Department.  Perfection at 95% was required to receive full pay.  Was a piece rate payroll with the 95% accuracy requirement to process application, changes and client concerns.  In the beginning it was a fun place to work but it became too dog eat dog with push push all the time."
good,Seems as though there was very little room for career advancement.  Very little communication from management as to why changes occur.  Good short term job.
good,"You will have very long shifts, that will take up most of your day. Management is not very helpful. They talk to eachother often or play favorites over the employees. If you're new, questions wont get answered quickly, most of the time they will be answered by another employee who has been there longer."
good,A Xerox é uma empresa que oferece um grande amadurecimento profissional porém precisa rever as políticas internas e também aperfeiçoar as promoções internas e a forma que o processo seletivo é conduzido.
good,"poor pay and management is not so good but for the reputation xerox has, i really liked my time there and only quit due to it being too far from home. there really is no work/life balance at all"
good,The people I have worked with are very generous. They give opportunitues to their trainees to learn more about the overall business operations. It was a great experience.
good,"This company is great to work for if you are young and just starting off in customer service field."
good,The is a good company for someone looking for the first job.  I would not recommend working in the call center long term. The opportunity for advancement are very limited.
good,"This job is okay but the trainer that I had was a very fast person and didn't do much more than just speak a lot. This was not the best learning environment, by the time the class was over I was still lost but had learned a good deal. "
good,Attendance policy needs to be changed. Also needs to give further review to staffing as they are giving people days off for OT but not seeing shortage
good,"The management is not professional. The co workers are so so"
good,The job itself is rewarding. We help the disabled and elderly which is very fulfilling. The management has no clue how to run a call center and has us on a performance based payment and our pay fluctuates drastically if the calls are not coming in. This is something they do not tell you about until you have already accepted the job and are in training. The training is non existent and they have you sit with an agent to learn and after 2 days you are taking calls on your own. (Not good)
good,"Sehr schöne Arbeitsathmosphäre durch Kollegenzusammenhalt. Zwischendurch kann man einschlafen bei der Arbeit da zu wenig zu tun ist."
good,"Customer services representative were paid by how many calls they took."
good,It can hold you over till something better comes along! It's the kind of job where you mentally would want to try to get yourself motivated as much as possible to move forward in life with your goals. Not a terrible job because its better than min wage for sure!
good,Working at Xerox has taught me every thing I know about customer service. I love to assist in solving problems for the member.
good,"answered the phone for Verizon customers, providing them with he best customer service experience as possible. answering all questions solving problems others had"
good,Hardest part of the job has always been adapting to the constant changes of client needs and adapting to it but it has also been the most gratifying aspect of working here; I have learned to adapt to many different lines of business over the past two years which has amplified my knowledge on businesses as a whole. Each day has been a new learning experience and personal growth. The salary is good but could use improvement
good,"Stable work environment, however limited resources, support, and limited ability to work above and beyond for the clients & customers"
good,"I am used to constantly working with someone on a call. There isn't much time for a break with the type of calls I take. I have learned a lot about healthcare benefits, billing, claims, and pharmacy. Management seemed kind of difficult to work with; there are a few good managers, but a lot of people who seem confused. Co-workers for the most part were really nice. WE all worked together to help one another. The hardest part of the job was having a difficult call and no floor support to help. The best part was helping people and knowing at the end of the call, you made a difference in someone's life."
good,With previous job experience the scanning position was quite easy for me. Would like to learn new things such as cross training.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Xerox although I was just hired on as seasonal. The pay wasn't good enough, due to the fact I worked at seagate and I did the exact same job and got paid $3 more and got treated better at the company. But yes, I did like xerox and its a good place to get experience."
good,"This job open my mind to employee benefits, it  was quite an working experience."
good,"Needed to be able to (and I did) go with the flow for fifteen plus years working for a small Utah based company, Unibase, a small outsourcing company catering to women in the workforce, bought out by one of the largest outsourcing companies in the world, ACS, Affiliated Computer Services, and then to be bought out by another fortune 500 company looking to expand services, Xerox Services.  "
good,"Xerox did not have enough personnel to perform the tasks of processing claims, therefore the emloyees paid the price by being laid off when the Insurance company pulled the contract. "
good,"The systems go down pretty often which enables agents to do their full job, the company isn't very big on compensation or just basicappreciation of agents there."
good,"The hardest part of the job is that it begins to wear on you and it is easy to get burned out. "
good,Best 10 years ever. I learned so much and walked away with a strong skill set that you can apply anywhere. I am forever thankful for working for such a great company that had so many brilliant people at all levels of the company.
good,"A typical day at work is even paced for the most part but there are many very physical days. Enjoyable co-works we all make a great team. I'm bettering my skills in a mail/copier facility. Management is cool, no one stands over your shoulder. There really isn't a hard part."
good,You need a car to work for this company.The Pace bus stop running at 3:00 PM and the last shift end at 12:00 midnight. There is no restaurants close by and lunch break is only 30 minutes.
good,"se reciben llamadas de clientes consultando por promociones consultas reclamos etc .Tuve un crecimiento laboral importante ,aprendi a atender clientes a manejar quejas bajo presion   a trabajar en equipo ,etc"
good,"The training you received goes with what project you are assigned. However, after the project  gets going and the calls done come in like they projected then you are put in a bag and if you name is drawn you are out of a job. Now they done really put your name in a bag, but when you go into work on a friday and before the end of your shift they are tapping you on your shoulder to let you know you no longer have a job. That to me is not job secruity."
good,This job is perfect for teenagers and young adults who are taking care of only themselves. The other groups are better off searching for something more stable than here.
good,The temporary position paid for my on-line classes to become licensed in insurance in 11 states.
good,"Xerox Company Cherry Hill NJ:"
good,"This job teaches you how to have self control, deal with irrate customers, overall how a customer should be treated in all situations."
good,This is a very easy job if you like to deal with irate customers on a daily basis. The program that you are working with customers is very easy to understand and is very self explanatory. No long scripts to read over and over again.
good,"I go in and do what needed to be done, in whatever department they would have me."
good,"This was a position to complete requirements for a large contract for the Florida Turnpike. Most employees were hired in through various temp agencies and had no chance at being hired into Xerox. For all employees compensation was competitive and if hired into Xerox the benefits were good. There is not a lot of personal time for family. The project comes first. Once the project is close to completion the layoffs will begin to happen. This is the job. You work hard, make overtime when it's needed and when the project is done you must look for other work. Nobody is exempt from layoff when the time comes. There are no prisoners here. The job is ok but, always look for more work while you are here."
good,"Iv'e learned how to help concerned customers, learned problem solving techniques and soft skills. I enjoyed being able to resolve the callers reason for the call. "
good,"A average day at work was talking to customers on the phone. This was a call center job and I was privileged to speak to america and all its glory. Management was great there were meetings with supervisors every month for any questions or concerns. My co-workers were very helpful if a floor support member couldn't reach you in time they did their best to answer you're question. The hardest part of this job was over achieving. Your goal in a call center is to make sure the customers reasons for calling in are resolved, before i would transfer the call to a different department i would talk to the other rep. to make sure they knew why i was transferring the customer to them."
good,Great Training and has helped me in my sales career by being successful working for Xerox.
good,"Overseeing 126 Doc-Tech centers, creating and training. Conducted audits for Sales People commisions, Account Payable dept and vendor services."
good,"This was great, while it lasted. Good team, challenging work, clean comfortable environment"
good,I loved what I did but the manager she was a dictator lol if you were a min late or looked at uour phone to change the song she would go crazy. I was there for a little over 2 years and i felt like an outkast. I believe the company switched from Xerox to Conduent.
good,"While I spent most of my career life at Xerox, I am not inclined to review my previous employer.  They have lost their direction and commitment to their employees."
good,This was a very complicated position. While I was hired under Conduent all of our hiring information was under Xerox. I had a lot of complications in connecting because of this difference. And the management team doesn't have many resources to help the employees.
good,"Constantly in fear of losing the job - 1 "
good,The job was great learned a lot about government assistance and my performance was exceptional.  The office needed more order and management was not fair
good,"Conduent Formally Xerox does have quite a few opportunity for those who are self motivated.  Although higher positions are always opening up, the training for those positions are non existent, so if you already have the background or are are quick to pick things up on your own with little support then this is the company for you.  Due to the company being a newer company, the compensation for those jobs tend to be a little lower then the average however it is a friendly atmosphere with a new story every day."
good,Working at a P&G facility I had to use the Xerox ticketing system to track my activity. Xerox expects a lot from their contracted employees and offers poor pay and no paid time off. These effect my Job work Life balance. Hard time paying bills.
good,Xerox provided me an opportunity to reenter the work force and gain practical experience. Diversity and inclusion are the advantages. Participation in work force programs.
good,"I can't complain too much about the work environment, but I have to say that bare minimum for benefits won't work for me. Pay was alright, but is a decent first job for young adults just starting out."
good,"Xerox is a place I would recommend to start your career as an entry level employee. Career advancement within the company is possible if you know the right people. However, the work culture is not the best."
good,I have learned a lot over the years at Xerox. Things have slowed down there over the years. Many of the Buildings are now empty. There are still many projects going on.
good,Was really good at time I was employed with them.  Nothing really bad. If I had been in the shape I'm in now might have been able to stay with them. It's Xerrox what more can I say.
good,"En esta empresa realizaba la venta de prestamos para el banco galicia. En este sentido era muy bueno ya que se aprendia de tasas de intereses y tipo de cancelación, se tenía un trato directo con personas del banco lo que era bueno, la desventaja  las comisiones por los montos vendidos eran muy bajas"
good,This job was my very first job. What I liked about the job was the schedule Monday thru Friday from 8am to 5pm. We had 1 hour lunches only mondays and the rest of the week 30 min  lunches which I didint like. It would've been better if I would get paid weekly and not every 2 weeks. Bad short breaks and 10 min break throughout the whole day. The most enjoyable part of the job was that the job was really easy and I learned how to communicate with people and helped them with what they need.
good,It was a good company to work for. I truly enjoyed the time I spent there. The only thing that I didn't like about Xerox is that the job that I had within the company was temporary.
good,"Nice Job place to work, enjoyed the company premises and good team members and supportive management. Flexible timings and cooperative management to achieve the goals."
good,"I was proud to say I worked there. Enjoyed helping the customers, but the corporate heads are hurting the company. They are using short sited info and losing share rapidly to other companies. They need to get back to building quality poducts and to listen to there customers as well as the techs in the field."
good,Muy buena base de datos. Poca paga y no tienen beneficios los que trabajan para las agencias.
good,"I was very Happy working with Xerox."
good,"Its a nice place to work . You can learn a lot of things preferred you are willing to. "
good,"Xerox was a great place to work when I was hired. We were a professional sales force, where they only hired one in 100 applicants. Unfortunately, the copier market changed drastically when Xerox's patents expired. Japanese manufacturers such as Ricoh, Toshiba, Canon and Konica sold their equipment and Xerox was unable to continue to rent its copiers."
good,"A typical day is driven by self motivation.  Management at the time varied on skill set based on area.  Being a regional company, competitive growth was limited based on a local level."
good,"They were a good company, good work culture. This place is out of business. I don't have a review of Xerox, this company was a totally different division of Xerox."
good,Working here was a new learning experience for me. I made good money & met alot of interesting people.  My job duties consists of a simple and repetitive cycle.
good,"I am not interested in providing a review. So since you are going to make me type something in this fancy little box, here you go. Good day to you all."
good,"Nice place to learn things and utilize at work."
good,"adapting to the job was simple. Everything was very repetitive. Other employees were easy to get along with, but job switched to at home position with little notice."
good,"management had inconsistent training, uncertainty of job placement, had you under constant anxiety and confusion, expected more from you then what they trained you on, ignored questions when asked and gave an attitude about answering them"
good,"A typical day at at work included taking numerous of calls with irate customers. I learned  how to be patient and humble in this type of work environment. I felt like management cared about the metric score only and not how well their agents knew what they were doing. My co-workers helped each other out if needed, sometimes they were more concerned then the management. Nothing about this job was hard as long as you listen to details. The most enjoyable part about this job was the Pay."
good,"the typical day consist of you coming into the call center and taking inbound calls from customers. you verify information to get into their accounts and then assist them with whatever they have questions about. i.e. billing, customer service, or troubleshooting. "
good,"Fast paced environment."
good,"The company was highly competitive, with high sales goals they also were not fair. Taking large accounts away from you at there own discretion, Xerox dropped  them as a authorized dealer soon after."
good,"i am really a people person, this was my first behinds the scene for a customer service position, i enjoyed resolving the issues the customers called about."
good,Work culture is not up to the mark we have tools but with lower version. No cab no food. Food coupons are addition benefit we are getting here. Shift is 12.30-9.30 which is good part. You can leave when you finish your work.
good,Bonus structure was hard to obtain  but do-able. Management/supervisor strategy needs improvement. Mandatory overtime and shifts slide dependent on the client needs.
good,The job had challenges of long hours and working with disabled clients. I was able to learn how to calm people down so that they could get necessary information.
good,"Vandaag starten er een paar grote projecten. In de afgelopen weken hebben we de mensen getraind. Blended learning en buddy systemen hebben de mensen goed voorbereid."
good,Overall this job is very stressful and emotionally demanding. It pays decently but it's not enough to make a living on. A typical day starts with hoping you can get a spot with your team and supervisor and not having to sit on the other side of the call center. Then logging in as quickly as possible into about 6 programs while trying to remember multiple passwords as all the programs require password changes at different times and each program having different password requirements. After getting all logged in you just take calls and assist customers with their account weather they are nice or just completely belligerent. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a good connection with the customer as it is extremely rare. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing I actually helped someone weather it was to explain something or save them money with a promotion or new plan.
good,"Agradable ambiente y trato respetuoso diario desde el Guardia de Seguridad hasta el Ejecutivo o Gerente a nivel planta"
good,"An typical day at work includes answering phone calls for technical support reasons.  If  you know the right people, opportunities for advancement will come around.  Management is average and the overall job is ok."
good,It was challenging learning to work at a fast paced call center but I appreciate a good challenge. Solving issues for customers and finding ways to make them happy was fulfilling
good,"Control of the KPI and customer satisfaction (Air France 3500 + printers and MFP / 100+"
good,"This is your basic work from home Tech Support position. There is a tiny pinhole for career advancement, but that has less to do with skill and more to do with who you make remote friends with. However the work itself is not hard and they supply you with equipment."
good,Some days were very busy and stress full. Some days work slow. I learned that over time I would not be moving up ladder with some of the management. Hardest was dealing with not having all the tools need for the job. The co works were the greatest part. They would help the day be a good day.
good,coworkers I had at Xerox were great to work with!! rather your new or been at that company awhile every one was helpful and polite.
good,"It's very different for me, not what I'm used to. The hours are good. Everthing is a liitle everywhere and everyone isn't on one accord. It's getting though considering it was a brand new call center."
good,"Good service and Products"
good,answer incoming calls in regards to health and welfare questions for the Mars candy company. I enjoyed interacting with a large variety of people. I enjoyed helping people with the health insurance needs.
good,"8 am to 4 pm"
good,"Image Quality Labs, where I work, the other employees are smart, very good trainers and a pleasure to work with."
good,"Xerox is transitioning into a services led model, and integrating the ACS (now Xerox Services). This is a time of both opportunity and challenges. Leadership is doing a decent job of keeping frontline employees in the loop, however it is difficult to see where the company is seeking to land."
good,I met a lot of great and fun people. fast paced work environment
good,"My work here finds me doing a number of things depending on what is found to be needed.  I could be installing servers, updating firmware, replacing hardware, building OSes, or patching.  I work with a great team, but management doesn't really seem to know how to leverage us so we find ourselves in a more reactive state rather then doing proactive work."
good,"Excellent people.  Very skilled, internally motivated and willing to help other to get the work done.  Leadership not so much."
good,"I work in a busy inbound call centre where every day is managed to the minute.  KPIs include call handle time, after call time, customer service surveys, and schedule adherance, as well as many other statistics related to customer satisfaction and service levels.  The main objective is to provide technical support, but many calls involve ""fixing the customer"" as not a lot of technical knowledge is required, rather than empathy of the customer's needs and requirements, as well as the ability to talk to them with confidence but personal to their  specific call and their own product knowledge.  I work with some amazing people and the office atmosphere as well as manager support are my favorite parts of this job, as many days require a thick skin and the ability to not take things to heart, but help everyone to the best of your ability."
good,"Long workdays"
good,Work life was great and the job would have been a dream come true if all policies put in place were adhered to.
good,"I enjoyed working at this company. I had actually planned to stay there while I attended school, and moved up in the company. I found that I was a perfect fit in this position. Unfortunately this position was outsourced."
good,busy from the beginning of my shift until the end. dealing with confidential and time sensitive information that has to be complete by EOD
good,Great company however undertaking company makeover and it has created many changes and confusion.
good,"1. confuso sem direcionamento"
good,The most enjoyable part of working for Xerox is the opportunity to be apart of new technology and product offerings to enable customer satisfaction.
good,it was a good place over all to work at. Friendly environment
good,A typical day at work at xerox was fun and very advancing. You had to pay very close to detail as you are controlling people payments so afny mistake can be a headache.
good,I learned to tolerate all kinds of people with different attitudes via tele-communications
good,"I have work daily on shedule of the day."
good,"I am currently contracted through Xerox Inc with a mail order pharmacy named Right Source Mail Order Pharmacy. A normal day of employment consist of numerous challenges to awaken active listening and productive time management skills while encompassing inductive reasoning with daily interactions has been one of the most enjoyable parts of the experience. The skills I have obtained through Right Source Mail Order Pharmacy consists of Guidence and Customer Care, Mail Rx Pharmacy Compatabilty Software, Array Networks, along with a skilled knowledge of current prescriptions and medicaid insurance information. Management and co-workers has always been a valuable part of the Right Source family and is always eager and availible to assist in any way possible. In any event of uncertanty there is always a helping hand to assist with various company projects, as coworkers and management are always ready to tackle, as a team, efforts to obtain maximum customer satisfaction . Problem solving and conflict resolution through customer interaction has been an exciting and interesting attribute that i have obtained with my recent employment."
good,"Productive work place, however no room for advancements, company pay was not the best for a multi-million company"
good,"overall, its an ok workplace. the management is great, co-workers are friendly, heardest part of the job is that its 24/7-365, most enjoyable is that we help people."
good,"Xerox is not a bad place at all. Good job if your looking for a career since its hard to change your schedule once you come on board. Also tough to manage school since most hours are strict. The most amazing thing about the job is the overtime. If you need more hours and regular pay just wont work Xerox is happy with the overtime since its a call center the turn over rate can get high since so many young people apply. Not a bad place to work just keep focus on the job for the campaign your assigned too and do not get caught in the drama at the workplace. Management is not bad as long as your doing what your suppose to do with any job. Job is not hard and training is amazing, just pay attention. The most enjoyable part of the job was really the experience. Everyday can bring something new with the client base."
good,"Quando fui contratada pela Xerox, pela primeira vez diretamente, em 2006, foi um sonho de criança realizado. Porém, a empresa não era mais como nos anos 80/90... Os boatos de falência eram frequentes e estabilidade era uma palavra almejada, mas distante."
good,Still a big player in the print industry but thinks cutting jobs is the answer to corporate mismanagement.
good,"I love working in a fast paced environment that I can use my customer service skills in a professional manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is being in contact with people with different lifestyles. The cons against the job is the fact that the schedule changes DAILY. There is no room for life after work, extra curricular activities or home duties."
good,2 hours on phone out bound;collect past due accounts;issue collection letter series;answer in bound calls;
good,Environnement de travail majoritairement féminin. Horaire satisfaisant. Emplacement desservie et facile d'accès.
good,"Xerox is a good company with excellent trining. I worked for a subsidiary of Xerox, GIS. Global Imaging Systems. I was a director of training and development, working with managers and sales people in alignment with Xerox sales learning curriculum."
good,"After successfully managing to avoid the annual layoff/reorganizations, I got swept up in a very dramatic reorg driven by the largest shareholders.  I enjoyed working for Xerox (20 years) and the severance i was given did take some of the sting out of the experience."
good,Lots of company functions to meet new people. Flex hours. Supervisors help with any questions about your work. The place is very casual and you are allowed to work remote if necessary.
good,"My typical day started with checking emails and making a To-Do list. Then prioritise any tasks left over from previous day."
good,"Insure agents were on phones at beginning of shift; turn in attendance.  Start side by sides, feedbacks, or reviews  scheduled for the day.    All activities had to be scheduled if off the phones.  This was to insure adherence.  Run hourly numbers to determine call waiting time and aht time.  Could pull agent off with permission if waiting for calls."
good,"As is any successful organization.... Sales is King. I found that upper management was not as attentive to Operational or Service process adjustments. For that reason, I felt any department outside of sales never got the respect or attention they needed to promote good will. For this reason I felt the company missed opportunities to improve moral and good will company wide."
good,"Xerox was an average job. There was nothing that would make me have anything negative to say. The pay was very low, and it was performance based, so if you did not do enough calls or if someone gave you a bad survey your hourly wage could plummet in a moments notice."
good,Repair different components from office units that the field personnel would ship or drop off to the facility.  Hands on management and field techs were helpful allies in repairing components.
good,well ping pong table help people to get away for minute and come back with there mind more alert and more productive and to operate with less mistake k
good,"During my intern experience with Xerox within the Information Management group, I worked with very talented, senior-level project managers that support the younger managers gain much-needed experience. I received aggressive training that really allowed me to give added value with the work that I was able to support."
good,"Even at its Mexico ofFices ACS, the job culture was great, I learned how to treat rude customers, and to be patient with this type of people, I also got a chance to work at middle managment for the first time."
good,Was a goddess run bur to fell apart st the end.  Shame to see a GREAT company picked apart.  I enjoyed my tenure there but looking forward to a change.
good,"Grande multinacional proprietária de uma grande fatia do mercado tecnológico, com grandes clientes. Porém perdeu sua estabilidade devido a falta de uma liderança com visão futurística."
good,"When I started Xerox was a good company, fun, learned a lot about management and coaching. In the last few years, the industry has been changing, and the company has been trying to hard to keep up with reduced revenues and has not kept it's focus on developing employees and customer relationships."
good,"Focused on reducing cost to meet performance targets, sometimes at the expense of revenue."
good,"I enjoyed working at Xerox, it was short-lived, but I learned a tremendous amount of information from a Learning Coordinator. There was a great team effort that was established between team members. Communicating globally was a fantastic way to become enraged and connected with employees across the globe."
good,"Great place to work, its laidback environment"
good,"outsource , outsource, outsource"
good,"I worked in Government Operations and all but one of my direct managers was inefficient."
good,"Xerox was a very nice place to work for, I always felt like a important member of my team. I have gained alot of important knowledge in the Printer Testing Field. I also got to work with people from other countries such as Japan and India. I hope to be employed there again."
good,It's a call center. Just the average call center with extensive training on technical support. On the professional side of most call centers I have worked in. Management seems to keep people in line and make sure we can get our job done with pride. training is very thorough. You take the phone with confidence.
good,"buen clima laboral, profesionales competentes Participó en licitaciones de proyectos, gestionando preventa, financiamiento, propuesta comercial y servicios en clientes de minería."
good,"Was just your standard inbound/outbound call center i really did enjoy working for them however the job security just wasn't there, however i did see a few opportunities for a career path."
good,very professional environment. Management is always available to assist if needed. Very large workspace and ergonomically correct chairs at every workstation.
good,"this once great company that valued its employees has become just a shell. manufacturing shipped oversees, sales and service outsourced to 3rd party providers, nothing left"
good,Making for Enterprise car rental services working on computers while staying in queue correcting wrong reservations helping customers in whatever way I can
good,"Office Papers, Application, Toner Distributor."
good,"Competitive work style,minimum amount of supervision and high level of dependency. Organized, well planned and systematic work place. Expectations are well described. Advanced modern technology are used and applied at work place."
good,"The only thing I had a problem with was the ever changing schedule which made it difficult to secure daycare. If I didn't want to move back home to Douglas County, I would have gone back to Xerox."
good,"This is cool job to work. Great Pay and Flexible hours. But if there were more supervisors willing to build a relationship based on work ethnics and not what you can do for them personally,It would be a better enviroment."
good,the company shifted focus from great service to the BOTTOM LINE.this along with a declining market has truely hurt Xerox.I think they need to refocus their view of the market as well as their employees.
good,"The job itself isn't hard, management can be difficult at best most of the time. One of the lowest paying call center positions in my state. Definitely deserve better pay for what you do."
good,i liked working there because of the pay and it was kind of a easy place to work but it got hard sometimes dealing with customers who were irate and made things difficult. The people who worked there were pretty much nice people. And was easy to work with. I loved our break room because it was a fun place to relax. And working there I learned to deal with people under pressure.
good,rescate el trabajo en equipo y el trato con la gente ante sus reclamos por un mal funcionamiento del servicio adquirido. Como intentar tener estabilidad emocional.

good,"Same daily tasks and routines."
good,"As a senior trainer you will have a lot of responsibility. If you work hard and deliver results, nobody will stand in your way if you want to take a day or two off."

good,"You constantly are on your feet, working hard, one task after another.  The time went by fast because you we're always busy!"

good,Understands that people needs to be recognized for excellent performance.  Great company that seeks options to reduce cost in efforts to maximize profits.
good,I enjoy helping people and this job was an opportunity to assist my elders with ordering their medications.  I also got the chance to aid them in understanding their insurance.
good,"Xerox is a great company to gain experience and different job skills. It typical work day is very busy. Co worker come and go regularly and that is the same for management. I enjoy helping customers resolve their concerns. "
good,"Xerox is a great company to gain experience and different job skills. It typical work day is very busy. Co worker come and go regularly and that is the same for management. I enjoy helping customers resolve their concerns. "
good,"Xerox is a great company in transition.  Sales associates and specialists work virtual and plan their own success.  I've learned a great deal about calling at a high level working for Xerox.  Their training programs were the best in the industry.  And the best thing about Xerox is the people.  Due to company downsizing it is becoming more difficult to have time to sell, which is challenging."
good,trans action not at liberty to say signed a disclaimer that keeps me from talkin bout them. job flow is slowing not sure how long they still be in business
good,"I had flexible timing, where some days I could start at 6am and finish by 2-3pm or start late and finish late, on Fridays finish work at 1pm for the week, completing my weekly hours"
good,Xerox is an intense place to work.Enjoy learning new thins and meeting people at work and in the environment. Helpful coworkers that are willing to help
good,"At home adviser role, I have had 11 supervisors in 7 months, the concept and supervisors are great but the OM's and above have no real idea of how to steer a ship this size, Leads to mass confusion and disorganization."
good,"This company is a good place to make money if your a fast past and hard worker, never call in, this is the place for you. However the ethic wise the management fails to comply with the policies and procedures that's are the highlight of what makes Xerox Company a great place."
good,Xerox is a great starter company for those who are getting started.  Most of the management really want to help others progress.
good,"Managers provide all the required help which makes the tasks to complete on time."
good,"IT was interesting, managers were incredible, I did have a lot of issues with one but maintained my professionalism at all times"
good,I likes working for xeroxbut I feel like management ws horrible there was a lot of gossiping and they did not pay well at all. There was a lot of training with this company ans I feel like they dont care about their employees as  much as they should.
good,"here i got some bad experience like , most working hours but low salary and there was no good relationship between the staff and management ,"
good,"Xerox is a great company to work for. There are pros and cons with every job. I enjoyed the atmosphere, talking to many different people of different culture. The management is not the best. There are a lot of rules with working in a call center. Some of the rules are necessary and some not so much. Over all a decent company."
good,"Learned a lot about the call center environment, also how to  trouble shoot various apple products. Management was just unprofessional at times"
good,A typical day of work is okay. I did not work directly for the company. They contracted me for another company. okay. I do not
good,"You never know what to expect when you go to work each day. I would have to say that it was highly underplayed on how dealing with yelling customers can be stressful, but once you're use to that it makes your job a lot easier. Management does their best with what they can do and they do try to make life easy for agents but there are some supervisors that do make the job more challenging. Co-workers make the job a lot of fun and it's an amazing place because of them. The hardest part of the job I cannot emphasize enough is the customers yelling at you through the phone, while the most enjoyable would be the co-workers and the environment."
good,i was upset because of a situation and i did not see someone who i could talk to because i was a new staff i was treated unfairly. but i know that xerox will fix d issue.
good,"I learned how Xerox and Humana work together to provide healthcare for the elderly. Management was alright, nobody really communicated well with one another. It was scattered around. Worked 10 hour shifts and they expected me to work an extra 4 hours every day of overtime. I cannot work 14+ hours a day, too much time out of the day and too much work for someone to be working in one time period. Co workers were great. Fun. Made it better for me to be there to work. Hardest part about the job was the callers. They were rude, really rude. Never expected to meet a rude elderly person, but there were a lot. Expecially on Tuesdays. Most enjoyable part of the job? Ironically my co workers. They were like my friends. Really fun"
good,"Working at Xerox has been a good experience for me.  I have learned a lot and it has taught me how to adapt to change very well.  Changes at Xerox happens all the time, but you must be flexible and know how to accept it."
good,the work place was nice with a lot of nice supervisors as well and a great trainer she managed the trainee well and give them advice that can help them to succeed on their career.
good,This is a customer service call center. The company itself is a decent company to work for and pays a decent wage. They have functions for the employees and the employees themselves put on potlucks and contests to make the environment more enjoyable. The customer calls can be frustrating and computer program they use is kind of hit or miss if it will work properly.

good,i love the income and overtime but the management sucks they're ghetto and shows favoritism. Depending on your manager they aren't lenient with taking time off regardless if you have a doctors excuse or emergency with children being that its based on a point system and your given 7 points for six months these points are deducted when you are as late as 1 minute or late and take off on Monday's and payday Fridays

This is crucial, could be life or death situation. Read thru entire fax locating necessary information to complete prescription request. Certain health insurance was acceptable at company. Determined prescription fill date, strength, duration and amount of prescribed drug, whether a customer needed to wait until a certain date for pick up or was further information required for a prescription fill. The patient’s physician verified use of a brand name or generic prescription drug and other questions if unclear. Certain prescription drugs had to meet criteria, which were answerable using a questionnaire from information received on request.

good,"I learn to use the skills that I have learned over this past year daily to solve the issues that are put in front of me,through the phone calls that I receive throughout the course of the day as well as helping others. The hardest part of the job is the information that has to be gotten is irrelevant for the most of the calls, such as the caller's name and phone number unless needed for processing. my c-workers and myself are really like a job family and that's a great environment all together."

good,I acquired an extreme amount of knowledge about cellphones and how the industry works.  You worked on your own and the pay was based on a survey the customer takes after the phone call is over.

good,Different Accounts cannot generalize I only worked for two accounts.
good,"Working at Xerox was great when I first started.. The company wanted to help the customers and make sure claims were paid out correctly... However, the company switched to an ABC rate, which means pay will depend on how many claims go out by one self.  This causing careless overlooking in the patients/clients records and causeing insurance to pay out incorrectly. It was also hard as they added hours, and with a 4 year old, I had no time with him..."

There are daily meetings with staff and the client to review expectations and goals.  I learned so much about working for an outsourcing company.  It is so important to meet the company and client goals.  It was also so very important to make sure not to violate company guidelines to satisfy the client.  Communication on so many levels is of the utmost importance.  We had a great team.  Team work is always so important in the call center environment.  The most difficult part of the job is having to terminate employees.  There was no struggle with doing the right thing.  Many employees were terminated due to fraud or compliance violations, nut many more terminated for attendance or not meeting expectations.  The most enjoyable part of the job was rewarding employees for exceeding expectations."
good,Ha sido importante y muy constructivo trabajar para el equipo Xerox
good,Xerox is a nice company to work for with a vast mix of people who offer an broad overview of people to mix with.

good,"Support a client call center of approximately 2000 computers.  Provide Active Dirrectly support for Domain Users & Computers, DHCP, Sites and Services, and Group Policy. "
good,"I work long hours and I work hard, but the work itself it quite rewarding. Co-workers are generally responsive and talented, but management is a slave to quarterly numbers and consequently use draconian financial tools to meet projections. We're often required to hound clients to pay early while at the same time holding vendor invoices. Additionally, employees do not get raises or bonuses (even if they negotiated them during the hiring process) and often are subjected to furloughs, if lucky, or become a victim of a reduction in force if not."

In between calls do as many assigned tasks as possible (you are required to do so many in a day, depending on the task, plus answer a set amount of calls).  It can be stressful at first but once you get the hang of it, very easy to accomplish.  It can be kind of boring. The hardest part is when i worked in the benefit recovery group. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the elderly understand their benefits and getting them information."

Overall tho the rest of the staff is great and if looking for a work from home job, and like apple products, this is great,"
good,"The overall work was challenging and exciting. The management created unnecessary headaches, but my agents made all the stress worth it. I would go back if a supervisor/management position opened up."
good,Good job with little to no supervision. As long as there were no mistakes superiors would let us work with no issues. Most of my training was on the job.
good,They fast track college students give them a gob that requires a degree then pay them less. They tell  employees they don't have to finish college because they are already going to hire you.

The original room I was in had just staff from the company I was in. Then, the AC went out. We stayed in the same room for a while. Finally, they moved us to a big room with different projects. Noone really interfered. But, you had two rows to sit in and the other rows were assigned to different people. Upon reflection, the lighting was overly bright."

I occasionally have a couple of colleagues that help me at busy times, but for the most part I am solely in charge of Aflac.  I have learned a lot about FSA's, HSA's and HRA's.

Working at Xerox has taught me how to deal with customer's that are upset with their products and services, and providing the best solution that fits their needs.

good,"Started out processing applications. Learned how to process documents and data gathering due to a team leader that saw a lot in me. Got promoted to benefit recovery, where I learned how to do claims and how to do fraud cases against clients. I then went to hearing and appeals where I learned to go in front of an ALJ to present evidence of what the state did to the client's case. And let the ALJ decide if the state was correct.

good,"Trabalhar na Xerox foi uma experiência única. Conheci diversas pessoas interessantes e incríveis. Agreguei muito conhecimento social e profissional. Cresci muito como pessoa, tornando-me mais responsável e comprometido. A única falha da empresa, ao meu ver, seria na parte de planejamento da gerência, que por muitas vezes acabou afetando muitos funcionários, mas nunca de maneira drástica. De resto, não há o que reclamar: A Xerox é uma das melhores empresas atualmente no mercado."

This provided time for our teams to interact with one another, and made stronger connections between peers. The most difficult part of the job was also one of the most enjoyable, new software meant new problems.

Over my time at Xerox, I gained a great deal that patience can go a very long way."

Management is interested in how we may better assist our customers. My co-workers are ready to know ways of providing better assistance.

good,A typical day at would work would be answering calls. I've learned to use a lot of new systems and the importance of HIPPA. The management was fairly decent. Some wanted to see you succeed and some wanted you to fail. Some of my co-workers were good listeners and caring while others were not. Some made inappropiate and racial comments to me and others in my company. The hardest part about the job was listening to the spouses of the military members talk about how they had lost their husband or wife because of war. The most enjoyable part of the job was listening to the militaryb members talk about the places they have been and the things they have seen.

I worked a guaranteed 40 hours a week and was offered unlimited overtime which was definitely an advantage being that there were times I needed extra money for the unexpected. I learned a lot with becoming patient, showing empathy, and becoming more understanding in the needs of my clients. The hardest part of this job was the clients who were very irate.

You are suppose to point out once you reach 7 points.  I was terminated at 6 and a half for attendance.  Also, there are some supervisors, well the one I had anyway, that would tell your business and discuss things with others that should be help confidentual between supervisor and employee.  However, you're hearing things about your case, from other employees, way before you hear about it from your supervisor."

good,"The most enjoyable part of a job is being an asset to the company bringing my skills,dedication, and maturity to the team. After a hard day of work just having the feeling of being productive each and everyday. You can only learn that from being unemployed and mature. Being out in here in today's industry is pretty challenging your faced with current college students and a degree is almost still not promised you will get employment. But what I have learned to continue with my education because education is the key to life and computer technology. Working has helped build my confidence and taught me the importance of costomer loyalty."

good,this job allowed me to assist customers in apply for Capital One Credit cards
good,The people you work with are very helpful but there is no job security because work is project based and they will frequently lay off and ask workers to return based on work volume.

This job was not something I had ever done before but what I have learned has helped me within my own personal life as far as finance and organization go.  I have learned to manage my time as well as manage others.  I have great co-workers, we help each other no matter what is needed.  The most interesting part about my coworkers is they are spread out all over the country, we have never met each other yet they are as close to me as kin folk would be.  The hardest part of my job is managing a group of managers who don't communicate with each other.  They will ask for something and ask four other people to do the same project but you don't know they did this,  keeping them in line without condemnation and wasting others time is the hardest part of my job.

good,A typical day at work included taking inbound calls from employees/retirees for the client you are assigned to. I learned that there is such a high demand for Xerox HR Solutions that most times it is difficult to service a client without being under extreme stress. My co-workers didnt always respond to this with courage but found ways around the high expectations so as to avoid the stress involved.  The hardest part of the job is following up with other departments to process certain request due to there being a lack  of manpower. It would take incredibly long amounts of time to fulfill certain projects because of this.

When I first arrive at work I upload my system and I arrive fifteen minutes early so that I can be ready to take my first call at 8:00 am. I enjoy my co workers and the most enjoyable part of my job is at the end of the call when the member tells me thank you and you have help me so much.

good,"Getiing the work done for the customers, co-workers helping each other to process projects that needed to be completed by the close of busness . How working together as a team can make the day go faster , and one can accomplish alot with other helpful hands . Basically management was focused on their work , the team was basically on their own . Co-workers were there no matter the issue or situation may have been . The hardest part for me was being laid off because of the lack of the work flow , after being an employee there for 14 years. The enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and encouraging others and knowing that i had a good impact on someone's life ."
good,My day started when I got a phone call or email stating the printer is not working properly. I would then drive to their location to correct the error on the printer. The hardest part of the job was trying to soothe the customer's feelings due to parts being on back order for extended periods of time.

There is a time and a place for things and the office isn't it. The managers expected you to act professional and treated you as such. As long as you were doing your job there wasn't a problem. My co-workers were probably some of the best I have worked with. Made coming to work fun. If I had to pick a hard part of the job, it would be the days when four or five different departments needed twenty boxes of paper each. Each box weigh twenty pounds each.

After 3 months, my supervisor asked if I wanted to train in Customer Service (given my college and work history). I took the position with the understanding that if a graphics position opened up I would be considered first for the position, which I trained for. When the position came available, I wasn't contacted by management and another person was brought in. I learned that patience and hard work makes for a reliable and friendly customer service representative. The clients I worked with trusted me to make sure their orders were correct. I was in good standing with them. The most enjoyable part of this job was the customers and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was knowing I would never be hired on and that management didn't always follow through with what they said."
good,"I work closely with other co-workers as a cohesive team to print and finish several projects to meet customer expectations and tight deadlines. I learned a great deal about new equipment and services that are available from Xerox, especially being trained to operate and do all required customer maintenance on the Xerox iGen4 Color Printing Press. Everyone needed little to no management because they were mature and were great self managers and worked as a cohesive team. This was the most enjoyable part of the job. The most difficult was that we were not always able to say yes to a customer's request due to time limits, commitments already in place to other customers, etc."
good,Management is top heavy and thus too far away from customers and worker bees.
good,I have been employee of Xerox for 14 years. I love the company but especially the people. Xerox has a way of selecting outstanding talent. Management is always supportive and motivating.

good,Fortune 500 company that offers benchmark training. Great opportunities for advancement
good,"When you get oversize documents, your document editing tool hangs itself and becomes slow in processing, then you have to look for other means to complete your work. I learned to be professional and handle critical situation at work. The co-workers are really helpful. The hardest part of the job is to convince the manager for something you have not done or something which you can't do. However you can take breaks at short intervals if you are free from work."
good,"My experience with Xerox was very positive. The assignment I had was challenging and I learned many new skills and contacts. Xerox provided excellent training and was committed to ensuring their employees success. In addition, technical help was a phone call away; prompt and thorough."
good,Xerox provided me with great opportunities for professional growth. I was employed during a transitional period in Xerox's history. I had very good direct managers and colleagues who all worked very hard to bring value to our clients.
good,"it's the people that make the difference. The days are long and having good people working together towards the same goal is rewarding. "

good,"Xerox decided to branch off from the government healthcare sector and once they rebranded the company to Conduent, it went downhill. Cuts came at first in the departments that were superfluous but then the cuts came in random and to random people.  That is when I lost faith in the stability of their employment."
good,I held various positions at Xerox during my 34+ years.  Most of my Xerox career was in IT.  I learned a lot and grew in my career.  My favorite position where I utilized many of my strengths was the Relationship/engagement manager position.
good,"Typical working environment, helpful colleagues and good mentoring from the right managers. "
good,"Work environment was not a secure one due to Company in flux. Company was downsizing at an unpredictable rate with no apparent direction. It was well known that positions would be lost, but no clear goals for where the leadership was going to take the Company."
good,"The running of a post and scanning room."
good,"I'm the only person at this location, helped with job orders over the phone, in person and online. Help with layout, updating and uploading files into ordering system. Ordering system allows for clients to upload job to several different locations at one site and printshops can move this jobs from one site to another for printing. Clients are very friendly and enjoyable to work with. I was awarded with the Diversity and Inclusion Recognition Coin in 2017 for my work/support efforts. The 1st person awarded that award and the only contractor to be awarded by the contract company. I've been given several appreciation letters through out my time at the contracted location."
good,the people i work with are great.  The company is not keeping up with trends in retaining employees.  Much work is moving offshore. Not alot of opportunities.
good,"The Leadership Team is completely in touch with the business. This is by far the most employee friendly company that I have worked in. Professional, hard working, top notch employees."

good,"It was a great place to work, excellent benefits, room for advancement, the best managers I have ever worked under. And somewhere the company started to lost sight of what made it great. Toxic culture, back stabbing, lack of accountable, and laziness with the supervisors. It was time to go and seek employment elsewhere."
good,"Empresa dinâmica agradável de trabalhar, principalmente se for locado em clientes externo."
good,"The work environment was pretty stressful, you had customers that would scream at you if they were annoyed or stressed or if you weren’t able to bend to their exact want. Overtime was said to be “scheduled” but it was actually mandatory. If you didn’t work an extra hour on your daily shift, you were required to come in on one of your days off to complete it."
good,Not a bad place to work but customer service is terrible.  To many people have to be involved to fix client issues.  Average time to fix Xerox mistake for clients 14 to 17 months
good,Responsible for selling document management and knowledge management consulting services to Fortune 1000 companies. Cold calling and Sandler Sales Training was a large component of the position.
good,This is a call center with self compelled computer based system where you imput data. You help people with government assistance programs by collecting income and financial information.
good,Happy working at Xerox and learned a lot of new technologies @ xerox. But too much work pressure and we have to work extra hours every day. Management team was good.

good,"Asignación de actividades nuevas, desarrollo e implementación de negocios."
good,"Very busy day lots of work to do and good coworkers. There is lots of opportunity to learn,  Lots of layoffs in the last few years and most staff in offices are temporary staff. Overall good place to work."
good,Production work is quality based. Most training is provided. They helped me with my education in my machinist field and also with my welding certification. I also was trained to operate material handling equipment. They also help you with education for career advancement.
good,People are friendly here. Atmosphere is great. Going through transition right now so management is sparse.  They do manage to keep on top of things.  Would recommend.
good,"While in Xerox, I got a chance to see Order Management and Purchasing part handled in Oracle ERP tools real close."

good,La maison Xerox est une école irréprochable mais les concessions n'en reflètent pas l'esprit.

good,"Learning a new location, welcomes broadening new slopes that you haven't tackled before, but welcomes tasks you have. Blending the two puts spunk and edge to your positions. "
good,"Working for a Xerox call center was a very eye opening experience for me. I started out as a customer care represenative. I was soon promoted to and offline escallation team, and online escalation team and then a customer care trainer. This is where I really excelled. Xerox leadership put me into a postition to and learn to hone my leadership skills. Unfortuantly out site was closed down."
good,"The overall atmosphere is very stressful dealing with the upset mbrs but that is balanced by the satisfied customers you interact with. Some supervisors are very lazy and didnt help as they should. Benefits of free lunch was diluted by the fact you would not be able to take a lunch to eat your food, you would be required to stay clocked in and take calls while eating. Most of the time the food was cold and the servings were not enough to satisfy ones hunger."
good,It was fast paced job but workable. The lunches were too short  or you did not get a lunch if work was behind or too many calls coming in at one time.
good,"There is a lot to learn working for Xerox,  It can be high paced, in addition to downtime.  There are great opportunities to learn various courses that are free"

good,"I would like to give this company many more stars however, the reason I no longer work for this company is due to the simple fact that they've chosen to discontinue. Management was unsuccessful in letting me know ahead of time that they company was closing. I was left without a job, and to me that seemed to be a major waste of my time. Other than that management was pleasant to work with, very professional."
good,"Uma empresa familiar, com muita facilidade em trabalhar, pois com pouca responsabilidade em termos de horário e separação de pessoas."
good,"Secure company to work at.The people are very friendly and collaborative. They have much opportunities to grow."
good,"It was very busy at times especially by end of month and beginning due to benefits. I learned alot regarding social security , child support, state pay checks etc. Funds could only be accessed by credit cards I would issue to customers."
good,"Its been good experience working for Xerox, modern workplace, friendly people. Unfortunately I was only a casual worker needed during the project only. Wish I could get a full time position."
good,Good company. IT staff stretched too thin. Pay and benefits are good. A large part of IT has been outsourced/offshored. This makes day to day support a challenge in some cases.
good,"Hele leuke collega's. Leuk werk om te doen klanten met technische problemen hardware en software oplossen. Het geeft voldoening als je weer een case oplost en iemand hier blij mee kan maken. Weinig doorgroei mogelijkheden."
good,"I was given freedom to develop my sales territory which I enjoyed. My focus was on making customers happy and asking for referrals. There were significant challenges and failures in service delivery and technical support after the sale was completed. There were an excessive amount of ""fires"" for me ""to put out"" after the sale, that hurt opportunities for referrals and took time away from prospecting and account maintenance."
good,"Good working atmosphere and management. Friendly managers "
good,"It's a pretty decent place to work, but you do have to be able to put up with the stress that comes with it, but if you can cope with the customers and goals, then you will likely not leave this job for a few years."
good,"Fast paced, great experience. "

good,"I really enjoyed the job but it had taken on some new accounts that we monitored.  It was pretty mixed up in the beginning (finding and correcting the ""kinks"" as they arose, etc.)  I ended up leaving because of the mileage and weather.  It was a bad winter and I messed up 2 cars due to the weather and mileage."
good,Xerox provided many opportunities to improve your knowledge.  Co-workers good. Many diverse platforms on with to work . Xerox square and Webster complexes OK to work.
good,"Xerox Business Services as a company has balanced work load and the environment is positive. Although this organization lacks in work schedule flexibility and has competitive career growth opportunities to look forward to."

good,"Xerox Services (previously ACS) is a company with good work life balance, but now that Conduent has taken over, there has been a lot of changes with change in company values."
good,"L'ambiance était agréable."
good,I have to say that Xerox has been the best company I have ever had. The work culture had its ups and downs just like any company. The night managers were a bit rude but could be ignored. We had unlimited OT which was the bomb.com. I resigned due to illness but would work for them again in a heart beat.
good,"It really depends on the client you work for, some managers are caring some are not. M-F which is great but some clients work late. There is a cafe in the building but its pricey, vending machines all over which is cool. They hire based on attendance before performance btw so who cares whats going on in your life, better be at work. great pay though."
good,Overall good company to work for.  Would recommend to friends and family.  I enjoyed all my years with the company through the good times and the struggles.
good,Xerox is a good company and employee driven corporation. I admire their transparency with the happenings and status of the company regularly. Work life balance is being observe at all time.
good,"Skilled trainers, good amount of time spent on training before put on the floor. On floor management and supervisors were very helpful and willing to teach new things."
good,"You'll get all of your hours, depending on what department you get in will determine your advancement some departments have it some don't it's all luck of the draw."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Xerox/Conduent, but the constant threat of layoffs did a lot of damage to the morale of the office that i worked in. Compensation and benefits were far superior to the last company I had spent nearly a decade working for. My manager was very understanding of work/life balance, and work from home opportunities were available. Ultimately the need to reduce headcount affected me, and will remain a cloud over the company for the near future."
good,"I enjoyed my time at the Barbourville RDF. Good management for the most part. I only gave 2 stars for ""job security/advancement"", but it's simply the nature of the beast with these types of contract jobs."
good,"had a great manager, very knowledgeable, enjoyed working there at the time. lots of young people at the time straight out of college and eager to learn"
good,"A typical day was indeed very stressful but that is normal considering what kind of work i was doing. I was working and dealing with the public all day long. I would be in the phones from 10am until 9pm 4 days a week assis people with their cell phones and troubles. xerox did provide us with breaks and a 1 hour lunch, but they were very staggered and far between or clumped all together. They were fair in how they determined things and prizes or awards."
good,"It is a xerox centre. Very very busy during day/office hours. Many outsiders come and take xerox copies (photo copies). The public may also require different types of computer print outs, designing, book works, etc."
good,it was very hectic from 8 o'clock till we close especially during our pick hours because we would even work overtime. I have learned that customers are always right and  working as a team made our production to be good . Management was very corporative and the work environment was fun.
good,"j'ai effectué une mission de 2 ans dans l'entreprise Xerox au service facturation où j'étais chargé de la gestion des données clients. Étant en intérim et vu la situation actuelle de l’entreprise il n'y avait pas d'opportunité de développement."
good,A typical day at work is helping customers and getting to know your co-workers. The job helped to expand my customer service knowledge. We are a family when it counts.
good,"I were hired in this company as a fresher, in  xerox i learnt alot and now i had serve 2 yrs of service overhere its a time to learn more and get sticked with another Giant organisation where i can improove my Analytical,Managerial skills and showcase them because i am not seeing a good growth over here because if you were hired as a frsher in a company the company tooks you very lightly for minimum 3 yrs and for your carrier perspective you have to switch to the another company to get you carrier on track."
good,"Great work place, but only Work nothing is there apart from work."
good,I enjoyed working here. It was a laid back atmosphere. I got to learn a lot of new things. The best part of the job was you could listen to music and I loved that.
good,"The  management  was easy to  work  with  and  the  hours  were not  to bad  most  of the people i worked with  were good people. working  with   the customers  was great "

good,"no further comments, the work I did I was glad that I did for the ducation and experience. would recommend to those looking to fine tune skills"
good,"Xerox is really a very good organisation to work with."
good,"The typical day at work, would be arriving at your scheduled time to log into your computer and phone; answering phone calls, for members, account holders, or co-holders. Answering simple questions from what was in the account to what could they use the account for. giving out information that would be helpful in the future use of the accounts. I learned how benefits and customer service worked, what was required and what wouldn't work. Management...culture in the workplace was very diverse and open, making it very fun to work, and get to know others of a different culture. the hardest part about the job, was having to bounce back into a positive attitude after dealing with a rude, or creatively worded customer. the best part about the job was leaving at the end of the day knowing that I helped allot of people and they left the conversation with more than they knew when they first called in."

good,Enjoy the challenges of working for a fortune 500 company. Over the years working at Xerox I have worked with some very talented co-workers that have made it a great place to work. As the company has been in the transition of focusing the company in a new direction it has been a challenge to work in a stressful environment and lack of job security.
good,"A typical day at work was just coming to work and dealing with different personalities. I also learned how to deal with different people. Management never wanted to work with us for scheduling."

good,"I currently work as a retention customer care representative , I find that the most enjoyable part of this job is when i can help someone. A typical day at work involves providing customer service and retaining customers. My co-workers are a pleasure to work with. There isn't anything I find complicated about this job ."
good,"Good place to start career."

good,"Company in Wilsonville is shrinking at an alarming rate as they exit the solid ink markets.  When things were good they could be very good ,  it has been several years since that was the case"
good,Working in a call center environment.  I believe that the management  could use more training to deal with the day to day operations.  They seemed to be overwhelmed with their jobs and responsibilities.
good,"this job was a very good experience that I had with them, I did learn a lot, and I really enjoy it my co-workers, on the hardest part of the job was sometimes we had too many copy jobs that we did not had enough time to finish it on time, and client got mad, other than that it was a very productive time that I had with Xerox."

They change our seats regularly so I am able to make new friends throughout my department and like having the opportunity to meet knew people."

good,Working at xerox had its ups and downs. The money was great. Advancement opportunities were always there. The only downfall was that management had their picks and would make the job more stressful.
good,The job stated off to be a good job. We was a team that help each other on the day to day need of the customer. We had got new supervisors and all went down hill. They was not reay for all the change's that happen.
good,My overall experience here was remarkable but I feel that there is more room for growth.  I appreciate everything this job had to offer to me.

good,"Lo que mas eh aprendido de este trabajo es atencion al cliente, y como satsifacer sus necesidades & resolver sus problemas, los colegas que eh conocido son...especiales, todos unicos e increibles amigos...sin embargo si llega a ser estresante ser insultado por problemas nada relacionados...la gerencia hay veces que puede resultar un poco partidaria y dudosa...rara vez justa"

I usually get my first inbound call no later than 8:01am, and from that point up until 5pm (minus breaks and lunch) I am helping Verizon wireless customers with all of their billing, payment, upgrade, troubleshooting questions. this job has really taught me how to be patient and empathize with people. my co-workers are very fun and I enjoy working amongst them. management is kind of all over the place, due to the fact that there's so little of them and so many of us customer service agents. The hardest part about this job is not knowing what kind of mood the customers are going to be in, or not knowing how extreme the issue may be before you answer the phone. The easiest part of this job is being able to talk on the phone with a customer for 30 minutes to an hour and have them tell you how great you've been and how you were able to finally fix their problem."
good,I enjoyed my job and talking to customers. It was nice to have full hours and get paid a decent wage. Unfortunately because of things out of our control. Our department was let go.

good,"I am interested in pursuing a new career that allows for greater advancement opportunities, a better work life balance and better support from management."
good,"inbound calls, new great pay and sales bonus, must be able to do mandatory overtime, will not work with doctor's notes or emergencies, will still be reprimanded for missing work, limited chance for advancement because it is not about tenure or how well you are doing, its whether the right people like you in your department or not, best part about working here is pay, newly increased base pay to 11.25 with chance to receive up to 0.25 raise every 3 months, worst part is management and work/life balance, if you don't have the time for them when they want you to work mandatory overtime they will not bend if you have an emergency and need time off"

I will email the customer when they engine has shipped to let them review all the work we have done to a engine. Sometimes working with engines can be stressful. Especially when some of the GE employees don't want to do their job. I enjoy getting to learn about engines along the way."
good,"I contribute a lot of my interpersonal skill growth to working at Xerox.  There is a continuous commitment to helping to helping one-another. The sense of teamwork between co-workers as well as your supervisors is uncanny.

good,"A typical day at Xerox would consist of account analysis for customers throughout a shift. Interacting with employees that help your attitude throughout the day. I would learn communications skills every day by talking down an irate customer making them comfortable within a situation. The hardest part of the job was preventing a supervisor from getting involved in your call, making it harder to please the customer on your own."
good,Xerox is very unprofessional. They only promote and help the people that they know. They are very very messy. They will hire anybody. Their training sucks. Their management sucks.

Management wasnt very helpful at times and training was very blog. My co-workers were great and fun to work with and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was finding in their computer systems how to find information needed to answer questions customers had and their training could have been better. The most enjoyable was helping Medicare customers understand their plans better, getting them what they need and getting them a affordable plan that suits their needs."

Especially, the ability to handle pressure. its not always that co-workers do agree on all issues, but in Xerox i have learnt that despite all the disagreements we might have, at work we do things as a family. the hardest part of the job is binding, one has to stand on the binding machine the whole day. Lamination is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Once at work and setup my station I was off and going on the phones. I was taught many different databases to use in only a two week training.  The management was very professional. My co-workers were always there to assist if I had a problem. The hardest part of the job was just trying to adapt all the information with the software provided until I became used to it. Leaving with a smile on my face knowing I had succeeded for that day. And everyone told me.
good,"A typical day at work will have you on the phone 80% of the time. You will learn phone communication skills and diary/time management.

good,"Overall working at Xerox paid my bills, but the compensation is dramatically lower than most companies offering the same positions. You work depends on the companies needs, so although you may get hired for one task, you may end up doing  4-5 task which you must meet a standard for. Failing to meet the standard will end in termination. When you are given a new task, you are not given a raise or incentive. There is not employee parties, appreciations, or incentives other than compensation. Most of the employees there are long term employees who feel that they will not be able to find another job outside of Xerox due to their age. Its a sad, and bland work place."

good,not a bad job there are fun times and bad times like any job. Typically calls come in after one after another management is okay and co worker can get you through the day the most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid the hardest part of the job is learning everything they did not teach in training
good,"A typical day at work for me would be fly by due to call volume. I learned that patience is one of the keys to success at xerox.

good,"I love working there until I found out Apple would not hire you if you work for Xerox the company they hired to manage the iTunes Store "
good,I joined the company during transition. Most of my experience is with Conduent. I enjoyed my experience with Xerox. The facilities were very nice. I worked at several locations.
good,Xerox was a great place to work. They keep you busy at a fast pace. The team is very helpful and work you with on most projects. Management allows you to work independently when needed.
good,"Workplace culture promoted a sense of family, and it made it fun to come to work on a daily basis.  The main drawback was the lack of opportunity for upward mobility within the company."
good,"The position was a great opportunity and stepping stone in my career. They have some of the best training in the world, however they tend to treat you like a number. and depending on your management you might get tricked into an impossible commission based contract which can be hard to get out of. Overall a great learning and growth opportunity."
good,"There was a lot of lay-offs and pay freezes the years that I was there, but I don't think this was normal for them. Not a bad place to work. Working from home was nice for a while."
good,Most of the time if you didn't have extra training you would come in and start taking phone calls immediately. Everyday we would get a 30 minute lunch break and 2 15 minute breaks.
good,"It was ok, aside form the energy of the people in the workplace, I learned a lot & gained a lot of information from this job, it taught me a lot & gave me tools I can carry with me in day to day life"
good,"I enjoyed working for Global Xerox, I was working in a level 3 technician and was given the responsibilities, to maintain, help other techs, and trouble shoot Xerox equipment, with an emphasis on the Versant semi-production line."
good,"Xerox was a nice place to work, but going through serous changes. I would not have taken the position if I had known this at the time. The people were really nice and had long tenures."
good,Enjoyable environment to work in with a helpful staff. Tedious and repetitive work. Not the right place to learn and grow. Great place for someone with little to no experience as they train and test you to prepare you for your job duties.
good,"Worked with Xerox back in 2013 and this was a very informative roll, everyone was professional and helped you on a path to be successful, I learned so much about excel that I could carry over into every other job"
good,"overall a good company.  just that there were limitations of advancement here (in Guatemala)"
good,"A typical day at Xerox was spent making appointments, preparing for meetings and meeting with clients."
good,"I enjoyed by 20+ years with Xerox, performing many roles, growing my skills. The management structure allowed for proper supervision, without micro management, giving expectations and feedback."
good,The many years that I had with this company was a great learning experience. I had several jobs throughout my career that were very challenging and welcomed some of the experiences. The last several positions busy and fast paced and I enjoyed the multitasking environment. The contract billing team had a close working relationship with the buyers and we were able to complete most task in a timely fasion.
good,"Has always been a wonderful place to work in the past.  "
good,Mi sono trovato bene . Avendo lavorato più di trenta anni oramai conoscevo tutti ed ero un punto di riferimento anche per i cliente esterno oltre a quello interno
good,This place is a great friendly atmosphere and is a great short term gig to get into if your a college student or just looking to pick up extra income short period of time. They are flexible and willing to work with you any schedule. overall great place to work for in my opinion.
good,Xerox had it's ups and downs. They moved people around quite a bit. The atmosphere was really nice so the people tended to get along very well. It was my 1st. customer service job and I enjoyed working there.
good,"productive and fun workplace,helpful employees.-	Xerox Business India Pvt.Ltd (now  Conduent) is the world’s largest business process services company headquarter located in United States. It manages U.S. healthcare plans and also provides a wide range of other insurance and financial services."
good,Xerox provides flexibility and a self-managed work environment.  This challenges the ability to connect relationally.  Expectations to overachieve are matched with compensation and incentives.
good,"Xerox has always had a great culture.  They have typically rewarded learning and applying new skills as well as a ""softer demeanor""."
good,Nice place to work management is nice but lack of support just like in any call center in az once your on the floor your kinda on your on until someone sees you need help.
good,"Company is good,  mangnent is very worst and cab facilties are not there and no extra benfites for employees no proper communaction on update mangment level"
good,The class was to fast paced and not everyone always knew what was being taught. Our class ended a whole day early. Having people call and yell and swear at me was not the job I was looking for.
good,"Performers can utilize empowerment in many business decisions, corporate learning is a key enabler for success and working relationships can be very beneficial"
good,Very challenging place to work because of a very competitive market place. Large company with many opportunities for advancement. Leader in the printing industry.
good,"Très bonne expérience au sein de Xerox."
good,"I have learned so much during my tenure at this company.  I was given the opportunity to move around and try new functions.  A few of the skills I built were to work with all levels of management, become a leader, empower my teams to be everything they could be.   "
good,Good work and family life balance.  Good for people to learn and excel in new technologies and process. One to best companies to learn the scrum process and excecute effectively. It is having flexible work shifts helps to adjust family and work balance.
good,mostly down to earth atmosphere. everybody worked well together and communication was good between management and data clerks. sometimes it didn't feel like work
good,Xerox was a great place to work.. I would definitely recommend to anyone and would go back myself if i ever decided to work in a call center again......
good,It was a good place to work but still not comfortability as far as advancement and pay raises. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we did team outings or the management provided fun activities for us.
good,"This review is on Xerox Connect and NOT Xerox!"
good,"I would get up and go to work and walk in and greet people and then sit down and take calls ."
good,"I've supported my family for over 20 years by working here. I've gained a tremendous amount of experience working with people from around the world. Learning new jobs, taking classes, updating my skills over the years has been a source of great pleasure."
good,"The shifts varies allowing several opportunities to work overtime and earn more money learning more programs. The company offers several different programs, in different areas; the more you learn the more valuable one can be."
good,"Xerox was a good learning experience in various different roles that included customer interactions, bill payment and time management.  while assisting and working with customers from the most basic questions to the most hardest and complicated troubleshooting and making sure the device and smart phone is working as expected to insure the customer did not call CS for no apparent reason."
good,I enjoyed here the manager were nice and patient enough to explain when you do not get in the first go. They are always there to back you up incase of an emergency situtation
good,"work was ok, busy at time and very slow at times. "
good,Xerox allowed me to remain an employee and go to school for my MBA. I was then promoted to a Project Management role where I developed as a professional.
good,Focuses on employee training and support for success in client relationships and sales. Management is a culture driven process to make president's club annually.
good,"typical day is data entry, key, key, key. management was helpful, work culture could get better if it was a good teamwork ethic, hard part is the pay, you get paid by how fast you type"
good,Great environment when required to locate at either office in Kent or Belleveue. Friendly superiors as well as fellow employees that made work a little easier.
good,"Salary is a great benefit along with overtime. Xerox is under hard times with the emergence of a digital office. Xerox has failed to change its business to mach the future office environment. Overall, Xerox is a great company to work for. However, the company has fallen on hard times. I would not recommend Xerox for new employees as a career opportunity."
good,"Xerox is a very fast paced work environment. In the call center, calls are continuous and non-stop. I learned a lot about child support policies etc. Management are very nice and help employees with any difficult issues that may come a bout."
good,A typical work day consisted of answering 50-70 calls and solving customer problems and passing surveys.
good,The company is struggling in trying to create an atmosphere where sales are not increasing yet trying to transform into a new company where employees can feel confident they have security.
good,"downloading files, sending them to print to Xerox printers, assembling to make books for the Energy department, running a cutter and binding equipment."
good,"I learned many valuable skills after working at Xerox for 34+ years; I plan to apply these skills at my next position. Skills including:  Microsoft Office, Negotiation, People Skills, etc"

good,"great company cares about employees, company training is excellent, company car is great with gas card, work space is fun, loved working there oh and commission is good"
good,"This company, gave me the first chance to prove myself. I was with Xerox for four years and it was a wonderful experience. I learned so much, gained so much experience, and friends to last a life time."
good,"I miss the strong work ethics of my work colleges, when there was work to be done everyone worked together to get it done. I was lucky to have a wonderful manager as well as great direct reports."
good,I learned different terminologies used by dentists for the treatment of their patients. The sudden change of time is quite a big shock cause you have a different time zone from your customers.
good,"We created an atmosphere that put the associates in a "" i love my job"" mentality. "
good,Enjoyed working for Xerox I loved the customers onsite I was responsible for. Was contracted to Sunoco Company and the oil refinery maintaining 70 digital copiers and keeping them running. I was the first responder for copier problems and I would go and fix the problem or send it up the chain for a more technical repair.
good,"I wish I could have spent my entire career there, but they downsized by 75%. The best working environment, they wanted your involvement, they valued your input.They walked the talk."
good,Buena como primera experiencia para jóvenes que comienzan en el mundo laboral.
good,"Après des années à développer le Service, Xerox s'est récemment recentrée sur la Technologie.... et a été vendue à Fuji."
good,"there were not a lot of raises, work conditions were good though. I enjoyed what I did there. I would recommend working there if you're starting off on a new career."
good,Xerox's work culture was rewarding. They empower their employees and invested in them. It was a employee-focused culture. They had excellent benefits and invested on the employees.
good,Xerox has a good culture and provide very good training when entering into a new role.  I moved into several departments over the years and many of them were very good and provided a good team atmosphere.
good,Management was great. he was a great leader. there are great employees that work for this company who should be valued a little more. Otherwise company ok.
good,"At Xerox/conduent there is many opportunity and developments  that they offer. and although you go through a intensive background the laws and regulation is VERY strict here. "
good,"Great working environment"
good,"Great Experience for working from home for the first time.  Great training, long hours/low pay."
good,Productive fun and positive a n le to help other coworkers through chat.  Enjoy assisting the supervisor with the other coworkers . Enjoy helping and setting up spirit week for employee appreciation. Enjoy helping customers we with there issues and concerns .
good,A typical day was getting on the phones to help customers. I learned a lot about reading customers and what they needed. I learned they had to get a problem solved immediately. I learned not to pay attention to their coarse behavior. A lot of customers had bad anxiety because they had a bad experience with the previous customer rep or previous company. Management was great and tried to help as much as possible. I like that I did good financially there and met good people.
good,Work for Xerox at Thomson Reuters over 6000 employees.  Worked with them on all their printing needs. .  It was a great job. Answer all incoming call and emails.  It was very fast paced most all jobs did have company dead lines.  Had to set up jobs and send to printers and make sure all was printed accurate as the items usually for meetings whether being on site or shipped around the country.
good,assisted customers with health insurance. Giving full detailed information on types of polices and what is covered under different polices and why claims are denied.
good,"As a Client Service Delivery Manager, I was responsible for a number of high profile Financial institutions, I had both Op's and SDM'S reporting to me. "
good,"Boa empresa para criar uma carreira sólida, com muitos recursos para aprendizado."
good,"Okay a typical day at Xerox was talking with customers, walking them through making payments, troubleshooting, or ordering equipment.  Average work day was about 2 hours (mandatory) overtime per day.  Training about once a week, always being updated on new equipment, procedures, customer privacy, etc.  The workplace was a relaxed environment, which made it easier to do our jobs.  Supervisor was amazing, however sometime management could cause a division when it came to micro managing or writing up employees."
good,Overall Xerox Is A Great Place To Work. I Really Enjoyed My Time There. The Only Thing I Think They Need Improvement Is In The Training Classes... They Should Be Teaching More Of What We Will Need Once We Are Out On The Floors.
good,"In the 28 years I have worked at Xerox, I have worked in many different departments in all kinds of jobs."
good,"When I worked for the actual Xerox company things were good, in January of 2017 Xerox spun off it's Business Services division into a new company called Conduent. It was at that point things changed, and not for the good. The new company began to systematically remove the remote/work from home positions under the guise the company was saving money and gaining more productivity. My particular position is still remote but will phase out soon. We will be given little to no notice and I will lose all my tenure with the company."
good,"Great place to work, real opportunities. I no longer work with them as I had to migrate, but if the opportunity should come around I would work with this company again."
good,"Typical day began with Leadership Team Huddle to discuss accomplishments and status of previous or existing tasks, followed by plans for the day."
good,"A typical day at work is to get to work early and prepare myself for the workload. My learning experience consist of learning how to do billing, process the supply order and multitasking jobs. Management needs to take more time to learn the requirement of what the associates do before making judgments.  The workplace culture was great because all the associate interact with each other well. The hardest part of the job was getting let go. The enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers and it was a great ride while it lasted."
good,"Xerox is a company known worldwide for on-the-job training that it imparts to it's Sales Persons, hardening them into seasoned warriors. It is a company with very good processes and established procedures."
good,"Productive Working Hours"
good,"The job was very fast paced and i dealt with alot of people on a day to day basis, some were friendly some were not. I really enjoyed helping them i felt it was a very important job."
good,Company is a great place to work. They understand the need for a balanced work/life. They are open to making your schedule work for both you and them.
good,Only worked for xerox a short time before we switched to coduent but a typical day at work is answering calls working cases and 2 15 min breaks and lunch for 30.
good,While at Xerox I have had many opportunities to learn and grow in my profession.  I have gotten to work with many great individuals on many great products.
good,it was a nice place to work but the management team could use some improving. but overall i really liked working at this company and i had a good experience working here.
good,"Xerox was a great company to work for, the Management and Staff were very professional in Calgary. "
good,"The people were great, management was great, but the work didn't provide any challenge, which many people liked but wasn't for me.  Picked up a lot of great skills though."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was telecommuting.  Working virtual saved me travel time to the office.  That time could be spent working on projects,taking an early or late conference call.  The hardest part of the job was delegating projects that I found interesting and that I knew could make an impact."
good,"My managers were good mentors. The working culture was diverse. Compared to other Business Process Outsourcing companies in the Philippines, XEROX provides fairly good compensation."
good,"A slowly downsizing job with questionable future for the Boise, ID call center.  Employees able to schedule their own overtime and time off, simply maintain contact with sups."
good,"In Xerox Services (now termed as Conduent Services), is a really good place to work."
good,"Company very unprofessional at times .So employees are favored , poor benefits and they treat employees as if there not welcome after a number of years, support is hardly ever available and when they are the help is limited."
good,"Xerox is a good job if you like to be speak on the phone or if you are able to keep up fast pace working and multitasking. The pay is decent as well, its good for the job you do"
good,"Internal communication was poor. There was not consistency in advancement, salaries and management across the various client teams. Job opportunities, career paths should be more clearly defined."
good,Conduent is a spinoff company from Xerox.  ACS owns the contract for the work that is done there.  The Transaction Processor job is an Accomplishment Based Compensation position.  Meaning you get paid for what you accomplish.  If it is swamped you make more money.
good,"Working for Xerox in Wilsonville was the best job I ever had, unfortunatly all the work got moved to Rochester New York where politics prevailed over productivity."
good,"El dia típico es bastante rutinario, solo en ocaciones se efectuan distintas labores."
good,"This company loves to talk on the phones. A typical day at work included starting up the computer systems and databases. Logging in and out of company sites continually (using multiple screens). Sometimes we had system shutdowns (it happened pretty often). Management needed improvement. They'll hire just about anybody. The management team could have improved by listening more to their employees. The workplace culture was good. It was great meeting people in my area and learning different fields with different clients of Xerox or ACS (now Conduent). Their attendance policy was not planned well for people who are sick though. The hardest part of the job was trying to come  to a resolution for some customers concerns and also the repetitious process of sitting down listening to calls all day seemed quite boring. Also they have high turrnover. Benefits were good, good pay as well."
good,I really enjoyed my time with Xerox. The company went virtual and many areas closed. I would definitely work for my manager again. She was absolutely wonderful.
good,This is a fairly okay place to work. it is more for people that don't have children or not much to do in life. the pay and benefits are great but the management isn't to well.
good,They give incentive for those employee that are productivity which is in favor for us because it's additional compensation to us. That's why almost of the emplyees always reach there target quota everyday.
good,I completed state and local tax code reports. I printed and mailed manual checks. I made W2-C calculations for the state and local wages. I assisted the banking department.
good,"Very busy , always on call , fun, always learning. I personally don't think its a hard part to this job you come do your job and go home your job is what you make of it in my eyes."
good,Providing support for a printer line does not differ much from day to day.  Learned a lot regarding specific models as well as physical operations of machines.  Hardest part of the job would likely be communicating with customers without visually seeing their problem.
good,Talent is not effectively used no promotions once a Process is streamlined there is very few new opportunities. Growth rate is very slow. Internal job movement is seldom. HR team does not involve in understanding employee feedback or concerns regarding management.
good,This job was a challenge . You have to have great patience to deal with the people around you and the high call volume plus the personalities of the customers.  Customers will blame everything on you and talk to you disrespectfully but remaining calm and being consistent to find out what is their issue and resolve it changes their entire attitude by the end the of the call.
good,It is routine with more challenges as stakeholders are spread across multiple geographies in different time zones. Supportive governancce team. Thourough process followed for program delivery and measuring business case and benefits success
good,"Here, you’ll have a job where you can make a difference and you’ll have the opportunity to take your career in the direction you want."
good,"I enjoyed working at Xerox, I held several positions while there and loved all of them. At Xerox learning was definitely encouraged I took many online classes."
good,"Xerox doing outsources for administration and my client is pharmaceutical company which is based in the indianapolis US"
good,"Sitting at your cubicle answering calls "
good,"Un día típico es: Conferencias, juntas presenciales, interacción con el personal."
good,Terms of pay not great and overworked however the benefits of working for this company you are able to use the the knowledge and go else where
good,A typical day is busy back to back calls of members needing refills of medications or questions about their plans. Over all they are a good company to work for if you come to work and do your job as requested .
good,"They treat you like an adult, which is good, but you work long hours for seemingly nothing. They will not deal with the issues they have. Very resistant to change. The workplace is highly segmented and nothing is well documented. I had to find even the simplest information on my own. Some people were rude bullies and nobody ever told them to knock it off. We were just told that ""that's the way things are""."
good,"My almost 4year tenure teach me a lot about medical coding and review.Xerox is a nice place to work.Training and workshop were provided and given to employees for work improvements.Everyday task includes coding of electronic medical bills on the system,quota and quality is observed and maintained.However,not all employees are well compensated as some are based on incentives.I enjoyed my stay though.And i must say,the company has helped me a lot to grow financially,professionally and as an individual."
good,"De dag begint met een overdracht vanuit de trafficers die de huidige shift hebben gewerkt naar de trafficers die het zullen overnemen. Hierbij worden alle bijzonderheden van de dag besproken en er wordt eventuele advies gegeven over de aanpak van de rest van de dag. Iedere afdeling/functie wordt vertegenwoordigd tijdens de overdracht. Zodat iedereen weet wat zijn/haar taken zijn. Vervolgens voer ik werkzaamheden uit die niet afgemaakt zijn door de vorige team (zoals het coachen van de medewerkers; fouten opsporen van de medewerkers en dit ook delen met de teamleaders en rapporten maken), ik hou de bezetting voortdurend in de gaten, ik stuur cijfers door naar de headlead van de organisatie, zodat die een goed beeld krijgt van alle vestigingen en kan inspelen op bijzonderheden. Afhankelijk van het soort shift die ik werk, open ik de afdeling of sluit ik die af."
good,"My time with Xerox was pivotal in my career. The office atmosphere was fun yet service driven and there were great incentives for Sales staff, which added to the overall team performance."
good,"Xerox offers a productive and healthy working environment and  dedicated in empowering it's employees by sending them to various training courses. Ive gained a great deal of skills while I was working for Xerox but most of all I've learnt to work with different people everyday,  empathising and putting the client first as I was a field Technician."
good,Worked in BPO co workers were nice.  Guidelines for client were too strict. management did their best to accommodate employees.
good,"A typical day at work would be getting into the office and begin data entry of prescriptions for patients on medical and medicare, record keeping, archiving, scanning and faxing reports."
good,"I answered the phone and answered customers questions about Sprint phones. I took payments over the phone for their monthly bill. If they had questions about their bill, I would research threw the system and explain to the customer charges on the bill. If the customer was having trouble with the phone, I would go find out what type phone they had and do some basic troubleshooting steps with them."
good,Xerox is great but Marion All Star ia confusing and is always changing their reps. They never truely have things in order. Good job but no true person that has reliable information.
good,Xerox is a good company. they give a good benefits to their employees. The company is very fast to respond in the needs of their employees and also easy to deal with.
good,"Superb environment but need development the educational work environment under management."
good,I enjoyed the job. Would loved to stay longer but my contract is coming to an end. The people are great and the daily tasks were challenging but enjoyable.
good,"Fijn om te werken, hele leuke collega's. De sfeer is altijd goed aanwezig. "
good,"Not a bad place, good people. However, the managers don't quite understand how to separate their work from their personal lives. They will more often than not show up in extremely foul moods. But, they are still good people, nonetheless."
good,In Xerox ho imparato tanto ho dato tutto me stesso ma alla fine sei un numero di matricola......
good,"I had the chance to be exposed to the multi-company working environment and the US government accounting processes. My co-workers are great and my managers too. There was just one manager who was new to the position and everything went on to his head and wasn't able to act as a leader and motivator to his subordinates, nevertheless, he is really hardworking."
good,"Throughout many years of experience, I have had the opportunity to work with a diverse group of customers ranging from law firms, engineers, hotels and many other areas of business.  This opportunity has given me the ability to learn many areas of businesses and  management styles . "
good,"I worked there for 8+ years, with the last three working remotely from home. A typical day consisted waiting for the work list to be propagated, then reviewing and disbursing student loan funds to eligible students at Ashford University and University of the Rockies. This was production work (approximately 25 files/hr required with a 95% quality assurance score). I was able to maintain 100% QA for the past 6 years.  Managers were extremely helpful and mostly available to answer questions.  Our team consisted of three people, me and two other remote workers, who had all worked on the same project the same amount of time.  We were all given different special projects when time allowed. Xerox had purchased ACS, Inc. a little over two years ago and then decided it was not a good business fit and did not represent the Xerox Brand so was in the process of divesting itself from the financial business groups it had acquired - resulting in downsizing."
good,Excellent company with good work environment. Everyday challenging work. All day will be a learning activity. Co-workers are very helpful and supportive..
good,"Pros: Pay was awesome, benefits was affordable, company through a lot of bar.b.que's and we had a lot of staff pitch-ins every other payroll and even during training at the beginning.  One of the Cons was the location; Was in another city 45mins away;"
good,"Job was challenging, but mundane. I came from an environment that was a little more challenging and had a better opportunity for learning new systems, programs and positions."
good,"Enjoyed the challenge, working on aerial work, working in tunnels and out of town. Great work crew easy to get along with. Great supervision, very flexable."
good,"Working at xerox was very flexable with the hours you could work if you wanted to work extra, but not so much if you really needed certain days off to take care of excess things outside of work.Other then that the pay gradually increased and the benefits were ok."
good,Typical day was sorting and delivering mail though out the Cleveland Clinic hospital. Interacting with hospital staff. making sure that all Fed Ex packages were sent and picked up in time.
good,It is a very stressful but rewarding job. Call centers are very fast paced and required you undivided attention on a daily basis. Working at Xerox was very educational and I learned a lot about medicare. I was able to help people at work and outside of work with the knowledge I gained. The hardest thing about the job was when i couldn't do anything to help my callers but the most enjoyable part was making them happy. There is nothing like hearing the joy in someone's voice after do all you can to help them resolve their issue.
good,"As major part of my work was to prepare plans for testing (hardware / software) of the future products, I could plan my own work within the time frame, along the way big part of learning was researching the future products and their specifications."
good,Foi um trabalho com a duração de um mês. O objectivo era fazer a atualização das maquinas multifuncionais em cada balcão do banco Milennium BCP. A atualização era feita informaticamente.

I got many occasions to interact with people  around the world who where part of xerox from Switzerland  Denmark Poland Netherlands Austria Sweden and finaland. "
good,"Working for this company, I didn't have a life. They constantly changed schedules as well as supervisors, and when it comes time to request time off it is like pulling teeth. I wouldn't recommend working here."
good,"Xerox biedt een fijne en open werk plaats aan waar een ieder zich in thuis kan voelen. Daarnaast bied Xerox ook diverse communicatie trainingen aan waarmee het werk beter uitgevoerd kan worden. Tevens zijn deze communicatie trainingen ook handig en toepasbaar in gebruik buiten werk."
good,"There were some hicups with things getting done while i was there, but all in all i enjoyed it. Its an enjoyable job for some, others get too stressed"
good,"Many opportunity for growth and great benefits to help with leave of absents when needed for family or illness. Great starting point of new career. Job is relocation to Tampa, Fl."
good,"Flexible workplace friendly environment."
good,Xerox is a great company which accommodates numerous of services and companies. I have gained a lot of learning skills and experts in my job duties.
good,"In the beginning I absolutely loved the role.  I went from having no authority at the previous job to actually being able to help the customers.  Then it all changed and not only did we not have any authority to help the customers, the processes got stricter until they outsourced our jobs."
good,"Work was fast paced but fun, working with very smart people committed to doing their job well.  Customer satisfaction was priority one."
good,"O ambiente acolhedor na empresa, o clima colaborativo e solidário entre os colegas de trabalho fazem desta empresa um excelente lugar para trabalhar. Minha trajetória começou como secretária e fui até a área de RH, como sempre sonhei. Tive oportunidade para aprender, me treinar, me desenvolver. E pude auxiliar, orientar e facilitar, na minha ultima função, quem desejou aprender e desenvolver-se na empresa. Apesar do clima interno de muita dificuldade pela restrição orçamentária, o acolhimento e a criatividade sempre estiveram em alta."
good,"Very busy place like to be keep busy. I learned how to multi task with phone. Company put the employee  first, had profit sharing , gave bonuses and treated you like a part of the company."

good,"A typical day at work consisted of siting in a chair for 10+ hours a day talking to customers about billing issues, phone issues, discussing travel plans, etc"
good,Good workplace and fun environment. Great place to start my sales carrier. Going through the Xerox 4 month training program was most valuable and rewarding.
good,"08H30-18H sur Monaco (Prospection, AC, Marketing) "
good,"Our support staff here is goal oriented and believe in allowing those to shine in their area of expertise. Everyday there is opportunity to learn and grow . My co-workers here are for the friendly to one another, this creates a positive work environment. The hardest part of the job would be balancing the work load, as the flow of assignment change from day to day. I can say the most enjoyable part is knowing that at the end of everyday we have helped someone with their transition to Medicare from group coverage."
good,"Everyday a different challenge from imaging computers to diagnosing problems in customer computers to assisting network team in troubleshooting server issues."
good,"i learned more about how to adopt peoples behavior, what officers do , majority with our work rendered atleast 2 hours overtime daily and holiday duty"

Within 2 additional months I became a Trainer and Learning and Development Associate. Within 2 additional months I became a supervisor.
good,"I answered a bunch of calls in a call center. They paid o.k. for how hard we had to work. The crew did not have much of a personality unless I smoked. I am a non smoker, so it was really hard to fit in. As far as the job and the management, they were all pretty cool."

good,"Management is supportive but work is not distributed well across the organization. Lot of optimization and spans and layers, restructuring is on the go.

good,Management is good. Plenty of jobs in different areas of the company. Overall good place to work. Colleagues were very professional and the social climate was pleasant.
good,"I'd sit down and answer phone calls for 8 hours a day, the pay was mediocre at best and the benefits weren't any better. I did learn how to type faster and got some really good customer service experience out of it."
good,I work remote for Xerox.  Hard to gauge the culture.  Staff is very supportive.  Dedicated to equipping staff to grow skillfully.
good,Took average of 25-30 calls a day from customers requiring assistance with hand held devices.  Learned much patience due to language or age barriers. Co-workers were a lot of fun to be around. Very diverse group of people. Supervisors were great to work for.  I enjoyed talking with customers from all over the country.

good,"I recommend this job if your looking to build a career."
good,"I did enjoy most of my time at Xerox. I loved my relationships with co-workers, trainers, and team leaders. The company is extremely fair in terms of breaks, training, compensation, and benefits package."
good,Worked Mon.-Fri. I learned a lot of information about insurance that I didn't know. Some of the co-workers were very easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help member. The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing the satisfaction and relief in the member's voice after  successfully helping them solve their problem.

good,"Co-workers are cool, easy to apply job requirements, the hardest part of the Job is escalation that needs to be done with position to help them understand the situation."
good,"Provided learning development services for clients.  Company not fully ready for providing such services."
good,"A typical day would go forever. My job consisted on data entry, so that was 9 hours a day typing with a 10 minute break every 2 hours and a 20 minute break at the middle of the shift, so I can safely say my position was tedious, not so much the company. My coworkers weren't very talkative in the middle of the shift, but things seemed relaxed enough during the breaks. The hardest part of the job was simply the discomfort of sitting straight all day typing non-stop. Besides that, the job was actually very simple and easy to carry out. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was the fact that we were allowed to wear headphones and listen to music while we worked, though there were a couple of rules about that which were a bit restrictive. No complains though, listening to music in the job, I'm sure, is quite the luxury. Or, actually, there is one complain: I was a full-time college student when I worked at Xerox, but even considering that I was forced to work 55 hours a week, non-negotiable. Had I not been a student that would have been fine though, the pay made up for it."
good,I really enjoyed working for Xerox. There wasn't any job security. They wanted all their employees to continue to work under contract for long as they could stand it. Overall the job environment was a great place to work.
good,The typical day at work was fun and exciting. It was fast paced. I learned to work on a team. Managment was average and they were somewhat helpful. My coworkers were very helpful. The hardest part of the job was de escalating calls from angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help out customers.

good,"It's good though it's not related to my nursing profession."
good,"I believe Xerox was an interesting and unique opportunity because of its varied benefits and inclusive member deals as well as it's high grades as a Verizon call center. The training team was upbeat and educative, as well as friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy customers throughout most of your day but Verizon does give you the tools to take care of them as best you can."
good,"Corporate America with a pretty neutral vibe, nothing really exciting about this position or the culture at the office, pretty standard 8 to 5 job, the good thing is once work is over at the end of the day I don't have to think about it again until the next business day, I come in do my job and leave, I don't have to take work with me or be on-call, on the same token with that type of job there aren't many opportunities for advancement within that office branch, of course there are more opportunities within the overall corporation. However the metric system and the micromanagement system utilized to score performance is pretty black/white and many time unjust, unfortunately there's little it can be done about that since it's the nature of the job, we're required to perform in numbers and metrics is the default tool to show the results. "
good,"This is a fast pace work place with piece rate advantage. I learned how to work as a team and how to get everyone involved. My co-worker are very upbeat but the turnover ratio is very high. The hardest part of this job for me is I started before piece rate was implemented and learn the task at a slower pace that provided enough time to through research every payment it more about making money and half posting payment by some of the employees. I am a detailed person and expect my job to be complete with high performance instead of high pay and low performance. The most enjoyable part is finding all the information it takes to post payment with very little information so that the CP getting her support in a timely manner,"
good,-Worked on client's sites to develop customized forms to interact with our printers.

good,"Fiendly environment, variety of pl caling, enjoyed interacting with different clients."
good,"A typical day included answering 75 to 80 inbound telephone calls per day. With each call I assisted the customer with their travel arrangements.

good,"Working at the heart of the customer, delivering the contracted service level agreements."
good,Enjoyed working there was flexible with the hours and was able to use  my skills  as a processor. Co-workers where fun to work with which made communication a better place to work.
good,The company was a very great oppurtunity to work in a business setting. The schedule was very favorable so i still had a productive life out side of work.

good,"Productive "
good,"I enjoyed everything about working for Xerox, the account, the people, my boss my team."
good,I enjoyed the people who are friendly and helpful.  Always willing to answer questions and help in any way they can.   Management does a good job with a difficult job.  The job is very stressful.  Customers have very high expectations.  They can be difficult to live up to.  Talking on the phone a lot is difficult on the voice.  I lost my voice recently due to allergies and talking to much on the phone.  This is a good job but not for me.   I am looking for something else where I don't have to talk so much

Answer inbound calls for clients regarding application process or verify status of application. Take notes per call for case updates. Inform and verify other departments that would further assist them according to protocol. Clients calls would be noted according to the urgency of callback or supervisor attention. "
good,"Xerox has been a great place to work since the day I started in 1987. I have had the opportunity to learn every aspect of Customer Administration, and have worked at three different locations (Rochester HQ, St Petersburg FL & now Lewisville Tx). Interfacing with the Sales Team, to direct contact with our external customers. Currently I am a Billing Analyst, working through cumbersome billing procedures to meet the customer's needs. I have a strong  knowledge with State, County & City entities, also including Federal customers. I have also had the pleasure to work in a diverse work environment."
good,I would to customers on a daily basis. They would call service to come to their business and repair their equipment. They would call us first before placing a service call. Sometimes I would walk through with them on the phone to see if they could get the jammed piece of paper out or whatever the problem.  Answer questions about their bill they got in the mail or deliver a toner for their equipment.

good,A typical day at work within the Xerox company walls was fun as well as challenging.  We were well trained to assist our clients with any concerns or questions they may have regarding their Medicare and other insurance benefits.  We worked as a team and were rewarded for our efforts to provide excellent customer service. The hardest part of my job was leaving to relocate back to charlotte because I enjoyed my assignment and my coworkers. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning about different work assignments offered within the company.
good,"I love helping our clients and preventing fraud in the Fraud Prevention department at Xerox. I also love filing disputes and saving money so that our clients can feel secure in knowing that in spite of cybercriminals' best efforts, their money is safe. As a Level 2 Mentor I trained the new hires in proper call procedure, and Level 2 is technically also part of Fraud Prevention because they file fraud disputes as well. The new hires I trained went on the become the best Level 2 agents in the department (after I was promoted to the Fraud Prevention Department of course, as I was the Level 2 Superstar previously for 6 months in a row, receiving over 16 grades of 100 on my call quality in a row from the QA Team). "
good,"A typical day of work here wasn't too bad, you talk with people all other the country and provide them with high quality customer care, management can sometime be spread thin however and lack of support really slowed down the pace,"
good,"Come in to work, sit down with your team and your supervisor in your teams' assigned location. Log in to the company's call center system. Once cleared by your supervisor, begin providing customer assistance to customers who call in to the call center que. I learned how to multi-task while on the telephone with the customer. Management was helpful when they were available to assist us with customer resolutions. My co-workers were helpful with assisting us when our supervisor were not able to help us. Helping the customer when they called in upset was the hardest part of the job. Sometmes customers don't want to go over what issue they are needing help with resolving over the phone. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customer resolve the issue that they had called in to get resolved."
good,I worked with a great management team who made sure you were trained and understood your job. At the end of the day it was good to know that our client was satisfied.
good,Good company. People where nice and friendly. Benefits good. No real job security.
good,"Being based in Australia but working with NZ customers provided various challenges.  Each day was slightly different with dealing queries from the end users through to customer helpdesks needing assistance on their remotely connected devices.  Everyday provided learning/teaching opportunities where I was able to use local (NZ) geography, relationship built throughout the time with the firm & company knowledge to further assist customers to resolve their issue at hand and build the team knowledge base.  Providing support to both the local (NZ) team as well as the Australian based team was great fun as the day was fast filled up & each task was given attention to completion."
good,"My Experience as TSR with Xerox was fun because not only i learned a lot about the account i get to work with cool co-workers, i never experience getting bullied or any bad experience with them, they were very kind and easy to approach. I did not have any difficulties with the job because my manager is very knowledgeable and always there to answer questions when in need."
good,"its w as a great place to work, but schedule as changed every other day and it was nothing you could have done about it. did not agree with that at all."
good,"There are not a lot of benefits in the job, I have enjoyed working here , the people are great.  I was able to advance my career by learning a lot about Excel and Auditint. Management is great when they actually show up to work.  Hardest part is having enough work to do throughout the day.  The best thing I like about the job there is little to no stress."
good,A very fast paced enviromnt with lots of room for advancement
good,"Easy job to get and work. Very lenient job, very good training for the first 5 weeks. The work environment is good, as well as co-workers are very friendly and are willing to help anyone out."
good,The biggest highlight light of the day would be knowing that at least 60% of the calls was dissolved without a team lead assistants.
good,"Empresa conceituada, com horário flexível, porém com alguns problemas de valorização."

good,Xerox offered no stability. This was a contract job. This job worked well the schedule that I needed and there was a small window of room to grow. There were lots of incentives and lots of over-time. This was a high volume call center in which I completed telephone applications for Medicare and Medicaid recipients.
good,nice and very high speed work area! nice pay with great benifits
good,"Xerox is a great company to work for. In my own experience I was able to advance to may different positions in such short periods of time. I have aquired new skills, key skills that will open up many doors for my career. Management is easy to find and talk to and the work enviorment is comfortable and enjoyable. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to provide excellent service to the particpants as well as my team memebers to get every job done."

good,"Xerox is een leuk bedrijf, geen enkele dag is hetzelfde, leuke collega`s en goede leidinggevende."
good,"work culture,ERP,okay,good,politics,working with ERP."
good,"The company is recently transitioning to a project with Cox Communications but keeping the original managerial staff which in my opinion is the root of the issues. The ""bonus incentives"" given are a novel gesture but in the long run allows the company to pay you less and deny you owed sales bonuses as well as a bit of the management leaving the employees in constant fear of termination. Hopefully this environment will be different within the new project but I feel the root is the acting management."
good,No day is the same. You will learn experiance career expanding information hands on.
good,"Answering phones and providing excellent customer care to all my customers. I was there first point of contact for all the needs they had with there account as well as there device. I processed tier one troubleshooting, took payments for bills and other accessories, set up new customer acts and did programming on devices to get them up and running. Making sure to always accomplish first call resolution and following all policies on verification of accounts. Being a team leader was giving to me right when I got out of training as a result of this on days when we were not in queue"
good,"Meeting corporate customer day to day basis"
good,"O trabalho tinha suas rotinas diárias bem definidas."
good,"Como toda multinacional americana as metas são agressivas, o trabalho é estressante e a relação trabalho x vida pessoal fica um pouco comprometida."
good,"I enjoyed working for Xerox. The training was very thorough, and I came to enjoy what I did for the company as well as the clients. The benefits where great and I believed that I would stay at Xerox for years to come so I did the absolute best I could and was very productive at it. I came to realize that there was no incentive for excelling at my job. Perhaps this was because we were to be outsourced. Everything was great until the position got outsourced. I really miss working there."
good,Xerox provided a working environment that was both fun and productive. The coworkers help break up the monotony of the day and helped the day to pass by quicker than it normally would. The supervisors help to make the day fun and eventful.
good,"Lidar com o publico ,trabalho as vezes dificil, aprendemos sempre a cada dia coisas novas."
good,"While I enjoy the people I work with I don't want to have to spend my entire life with them. Typical days at work are extremely long sometimes 10+ hours that are mandatory and you work generally 6 days a week also mandatory. There is not much time to have a life outside of the office and that would have to be my biggest complaint along with the ever changing rules and shortening of breaks yet longer hours, it is a very difficult balance for those who have families."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to take what you've learned and apply it to everyday use.
good,I worked from my home which allowed me flexibility when it came to my scheduling client visits. I had a great team of employees that worked very hard for the common goal of providing excellent customer service.
good,"good company..."

good,Great place to launch a career in sales!  I also enjoyed the people I worked with!
good," Saludar a mis jefes y compañeros, conectarse trabajar por el proposito al cual uno quiere optar, a la vez compartir con mi entorno cuando se puede."
good,Unlimited over time.  A lot of experience will be provided. Diverse.  Call center made fun. Employees treated well. No complaints.
good,"The working environment is productive and provides the tools for learning and improving on the day to day operations. There are deadlines to meet every week and clients to satisfy everyday. It builds teamwork and provides the opportunity for you to learn something everyday. We are tied to a contract and if certain deadlines and requirements aren't achieved, then we face penalties."
good,Love and enjoy the organization I currently work for. The best part of my job and day would be my peers. 
good,"Time sensitive deadlines with attention to detail was needed in each department where I worked. I learned how to work with a diverse group off employees and had a good working relationship with each of them. The hardest part of the job was to see co-workers leave for various reasons."
good,"I learned a lot about sales in general while working at Carolina Office Systems.  With initial training that took about 1 month total with some weeks spread out, I was well versed in what was expected and the tools I would need to succeed.  I learned how to develop new business as well as retain that business with quarterly reviews with my customers.  I went the extra mile for potential customers as well as current customers because that is what i have been taught since a teenager.  I learned the importance of attention to detail and how to be successful in the Copier Industry."
good,"The typical day at work is fast paced. Calls are coming in from schools and businesses around Australia and New New Zealand. Most of what I've learned is about computers mainly and more on how to handle a customers complaint or issue and how to quickly troubleshoot a problem. Hardest part of my job is telling a customer that their parts are out of stock . The most enjoyable part of my job is learning more and more about computers. My co-workers are enjoyable as well, most of them have great work ethics. Management could be a little tighter, we have a chaotic environment that would need more manageability. When we need help we need to know that we can depend on management to handle it."
good,"I was responsible for managing stats for individuals who directly reported to me. I had to coach and devleop them, Take escalated calls from customers, and provide credits where errors were made. There are about 32 Supervisor teams at this site and we all had the same role. You were given a buddy supervisor to assist in any additional support and I would say the hardest part of the job was the constant shifting of focus by management. The part I enjoyed the most was when I coached someone and they saw results based on what I taught them. I love to see people win."
good,"Our day started with a mourning meeting to discuss the operations of the day. Then pick parts to setup workstations on the SMT line. After the machines started up, we stuffed circuit boards with parts, then set up for inspection and shipping. In the store room I received the parts from the dock area loaded them into the engineering data base and stocked the parts. Then parts were pulled for the machine operations and testing. Management was strict but fair in most cases. The hardest part of the job was there was all ways constant rumors of layoffs. Most of my co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job begun when the layoffs started. The most enjoyable was the interaction with my co-workers in the off hours."
good,Overall I liked my position at Xerox. I worked 40-50 hours per week Monday through Friday working either 9AM-5:30PM or 11:30-8:00PM depending on need with the flexibility to work extended hours.
good,"Aprendi tudo que sei na área administrativa, comercial e financeira."
good,"Faciliated kickoff meetings with Project Managers and Production Coordinators in an effort to understand design needs for proposal production.

Determined size and arrangement of illustrative material and copy, and select style and size of type. Created and maintained an archive of images, photos, or previous work products in support of creating sustainable, resusable graphic solutions."
good,A typical day at work was cool and busy the phones stay ringing. I learned how to type and answer the phone at the same time. My co-worker was fun and helpful. The hardest part was keeping up with my breaks. The enjoyable part was answering the phone and helping the customers.
good,"Excellent, dedicated staff. Constant change and re focus of efforts."
good,"The company is a good company to work for, they can be flexible with your schedule if you are attending school. The workload and pay does not balance out."
good,This a great place to work if you like people. The people here made you feel at home. A typical day would consist of you coming in and getting on the phones to assist anyone that called in to the call center. Management was great. The hardiest part about the job was that I had to resign due to my school schedule.
good,"I work 100% at home, so communications is vital with my clients. Xerox allows you to schedule your work day around the needs of your clients. My manager and team is great to work with and knows the client very well."
good,"Excellent training and work environment. Training was excellent. People are fabulous. However, many times the ""stars"" were treated favorably. Movement from one assignment to another was annual event and required changes in relationships, and frequently, account assignment."
good,It had a great management team that kept things going and in order. The people you work with were friendly and help in the times you did not understand things.
good,"IT helpdesk,"
good,"The initial position I was hired for did you have enough work to support the position, so I was redirected to Xerox Global Services to manage at one of their Partnership Print Shop Sites."
good,With Xerox you had to learn quickly and thoroughly. I was assisting with three different clients and they all had completely different plans and information. It was a fast paced work environment. My co-workers were the best and it was an enjoyable work environment. The hardest part of the job were the irate employees but the most enjoyable part was assisting those same employees and solving their issues with their benefits.
good,"Check on the tests, consumables, & technicians I was supervising.. Talk with my techs about any issues or concerns that had arisen. Organize & prioritize based on availability of resources. Interface with test engineers concerning their testing in the lab about any issues."
good,"My shift begins at 8:30..ends at 5. I'm usually answering phones, greeting customers and other co workers, going between floors, checking emails, discussing new company policies, maintaining attendance records. Management is pretty decent, they are great at handling their job responsibilities. My co workers are a lot of fun. They are very responsible and take their jobs seriously. The hardest part of the job is handling irate customers. We understand their plight but they have to take their anger out on people and they choose to do so on us. I love making people smile, either in person or over the phone."
good,"Xerox is a challenging and rewarding work environment. The day to day work is fast paced and very interactive. It promotes team work, critical thinking and execution. I enjoy the environment, the pace and the overall business."

good,working with xerox is really a good exp..
good,"A typical day at work consisted of carrying out tests on the newest software for Xerox photocopies, this often involved testing various features on the photocopier and comparing the results with that of a different software set. Tests were carried out in a team with constant communication to each other as to the results being recorded. However, the nature of testing means that new problems can arise at any point which could mean having to change the test or even start an entirely new task. As a result of this, I learnt to think on my feet and try to come up with solutions to problems as they arose. I also learnt to work in a team to both communicate and solve problems."
good,"I take calls from angry customers who call in to complain about either their sprint bill being too high or service outages/dropped calls......they call in yelling at you so you have to try and de-escalate the caller, not to mention if you need help the ""floor walkers"" get an attitude for having to stop what they are doing to come help you....the management isnt professional at all but do enjoy getting to dress in business attire and sittng at a desk alll day.the hardest part of my job is keeping a positive attitude and being nice to people who are always rude to you."
good,Company grew rapidly everyday we were going through trials and errors. It was exciting and exhausting.
good,Ensuring that customer needs are met on a daily basis. Making sure the industrial size copy machines and emails are checked regularly. Being able to multitask is a must. Hardest part of the job was making sure customers needs were being met and jobs being delivered on time.
good,Ive been an employee at Xerox for 3 years and its a great company to be a part of. All in all know that I want a stable career and I dont see it being there. Nothing bad to say about the place it just comes a time in your life when you have to move on to something better.

good,"well, being able to schedule my own time up north was great, but being stuck to a time schedule when traveling was not, sometimes you needed extra day or so, but managers would not approve the extra days in hotel, nor the flight changes,, this left a bad taste in my mouth, when having to leave, and a system was not functioning proper. Or,, having a discussion of why the machine fails when sent documents to print, and the contact IT person at customers site could not understand what his problem was with THEIR network"

You may be promised one position doing the interview but you will receive another position depending on where the need is . You also may be asked to take a furlough day or week."
good,"Please do not what get me wrong, being a engineer at Xerox is good but it was not for me. They train you well. You get a vehicle and they look after the vehicles well. Doing the work is all about numbers, no minimum is 3 a day maximum 5 or more. Trying to find the fault with the machine can be stressful and at the same time jobs are coming through on your phone which used to send me mad"
good,"•	Started out as a “loader,” my responsibilities include managing a shared mailbox and assigning them to the appropriate teams, within the agreed SLA"

good,I really liked working at Xerox. It was the best college I could have went to. I learned so much. The equiptment was nice as well as the shop. They were going out of buisness and closing the shop that is why I left.
good,Great place to learn and grow.  Paid vacations and sick time available to everyone. Mangers are willing to work with you to allow you to get more training and knowledge if you request it.
good,"If you dont know what you are getting into, it will be stressful. If you follow the FLOW then you will be fine, but if you wing the answers, thats when you get popped."
good,"It was a good jobs as long as you were able to remember all the ins and outs of the iOS. Coworkers ad staff were awesome, but the costumers were something else. I became obsessed with Csat and Dsat scores ( costumer reviews) and how it would affect my job. It became very anxiety inducing and ultimately became the reason I left."
good,I had a good manager who was very helpful and made the work environment comfortable.  We were given the opportunity to work as many hours overtime as desired.  I very much enjoyed helping people resolve issues and offering better plans to meet customer needs.
good,fast pace drove my own car but didn't have to worry about clocking in and out of work all work is thru your phone really like that you had access to management or your coworkers in case you ever get stuck but for the most part the training really helps so if you pay attention when you are first are training you pretty much set unless you come across something different they are really good in sending you help really like the area that I was assigned and my customers where all very good
good,"Great place to work , great people are there , management is awesome, if you need personal time off, they will give it to you, overall a pretty good place to work"
good,I learned a lot of different things working there but it is not a consistent work loads. Some months we were extremely busy and others were extremely slow. Management was decent. The only problem with management was that the managers didn't know how to do our jobs.

good,I honestly really enjoyed my time at xerox. The people I worked with and the supervisor I was under were all fantastic. The work I did with Tricare dental insurance is actually what inspired me to go to school to be a dental assistant. The only negative thing would be that the project was only temporary and there’s not a 100% job guarantee after it ends.
good,while working at the company i never experienced any problems. its a pretty laid back call center for those who are interested into becoming a customer service rep.
good,"Making sure all the clients needs are met.   We supply machines and services.  I oversee the services part which include mail centers, switchboard and delivery services.  We have maintained a 10 out of 10 customer service score for 13 years."

good,"Ni trabajo era muy dinámico y variado pues se tenían que realizar muchas tareas de diferente ambitos."
good,"Adhered every client's call expectations and each call included; Greet, Verify, Assist, Summarize, Close, Document. When an answer was not found in my system, made notes explaining the situation then called PTP back with answers I recieved, creating a personal connection with each customer. Took charge of all unresolved issues and ended up with many compliments on the survey system offered at the end of calls.. Quality scores stayed between 90%-100%."
good,"This company offers great opportunities for bilingual proficient employees. Bonuses, stability and a very solid work culture is what this company provides."

We were all on the same shift and would be able to hangout and help each other with certain calls that were more difficult.  W also had a ping pong table that we would play on during our breaks that made the time go by even faster.  The managers even allowed us to have a tournament that made us look forward to going to work to practice and compete.
good,"You get to work with productive and smart people  , but the company lacks a good vision. The company does have a good work/life balance and encourages innovations."
good,"A typical work starts from downloading the previous days work, then sample making, and checking/ review the samples."
good,I have produced customized web pages for Element K’s clients. I’ve consulted with Xerox for 12 years in the Web Multimedia Department producing various Cd’s and web sites for training and customers.

good,"Xerox has excellent resources to train employees on technology, marketing, business, etc. Xerox does many things right, just has aging technology and image."
good,The call center was huge. They have several different contracts in the building. I worked with the Xbox contract. You didn't have to try to sell anything. I helped people with basic tech problems. The location is by the mountains and is a beautiful area of Colorado Springs to work in.
good,"Most enjoyable was meeting new people and having the ability to be able to plan each day."
good,"I worked as the Executive Receptionist at Xerox Canada for 8 years."
good,"I enjoy working with my participant. We do all sorts of fun activities. It is a job unlike any other. I am not sure why I am writing this review, except I can't get out of here until I do."
good,"It was a great company to work for until they went out of business I did a lot of traveling and learning new things with the company. If this company had not went out of business, I would still be there."
good,"I love the management at Xerox and the hours were brilliant and very convenient. I loved the pay I was very comfortable and the overall work load was awesome, However they had to do lay offs because they were pulling the contact."
good,My experience with this company has been an interesting one. I was hired temporarily as a senior benefits coordinator which eventually lead to a permanent position. After I was hired permanently my hourly rate decreased but the overall experience in my opinion has been moderately pleasurable.

good,"Xerox was a good company to work for. "
good,"This job was a great place to work, but the pay was not enough.I enjoyed what I did and who I worked with. the only reason I left was because my Husband took ill."
good,Overall it was a good place to work. I would recommend it for someone wanting to find a good job. The culture was relaxed and at ease for those of us that like that environment.
good,"it was a nice and meaningful working environment, everybody was like a big family and that made the work more enjoyable and it also made it easier to do."
good,"Working at Xerox was a great experience due to everyday was something different to discover. Even tho customer's requirements were pretty similar, each people were also different."
good,"Normal working hours in Xerox INDIA is 2:00 PM to 10:30 PM."
good,Work is typical of other corporations.  Hours are 8-5 or 40 hours per week.  Really solid products and services.  Company has cutting edge technology and services.  High value placed on customer satisfaction.
good,"xerox was pretty good before switching to conduent and than changed our pay rates, quit shortly afterwards, easy work, fair supervisors, not flexible with hours"
good,"This being my first job after graduating from college, I was hired about a month later and found that everyone working there was very patient when it came to learning the ropes, and were very helpful if you had any questions or concerns. That being said, most positions being offered by xerox are contract and have next to no chance of being taken on full time, so this is best as a temporary position, but good for experience on a resume"
good,"Overall, management is very good at Xerox.  The biggest problem is that corporate is only interested in profits as opposed to customer satisfaction.  They send too many jobs overseas and let too many employees with plan knowledge leave."
good,"Working on client request. Verifying Participant and dependents documents and certifying and enrolling them into benefits accordingly.."
good,"I worked several weeks in bringing up a poorly maintained piece of equipment. I was successful and received a special report from my"
good,"Xerox has a good environment and the people are very friendly. It is a good place to grow and learn new things. In working at this job, you do learn more about the call center environment and how to professionally answer calls. It prepares you for stressful situations and how to handle those when it does occur."
good,ok place to work not much time for any social interaction. hard to find parking in or around campus and vert short lunch and breaks. overtime is readily available during open enrollment and weekly based on needs. Occasionally overtime is mandatory.
good,"Managing the clients website and annual enrollments had good and bad days. I managed the web developers which was all done offshore in India. I had a good realtionship with the team. The client was very agressive making changes to their website, some were easier than others. I worked for home which was a plus since there was a 9.5 hour time difference with the offshore team. After writing all the requirement updates for the developers I needed to be available to approve all the web updates they made. Working from home made that a little easier since the updates were all done after 9:00 pm ET. I ran weekly calls with the client and also internal calls with my team."
good,"Typical day was customer phone calls from 7:30am to 9am, in the field from 9 to 5, return customer calls from 5:30pm to 6:30pm, two hours after dinner updating CRM with the days sales calls, territory planning, scheduling install and service calls for Xerox team."
good,"Xerox was a great stepping stone in my career, and at times I look back and wonder if I should have stayed rather than move on. Its a large company with the typical red tape associated with the management of such a large company, but the managers seemed to really care about their employees which helped tremendously during stressful situations while trying to meet deadlines. Xerox was a friendly place for me to work, and the employees I met and worked with all showed professionalism and dedication."
good,My focus is schools and xerox product offering has adequate options which clients can choose from in line with their printing needs as well as their copying options
good,Management wasn't very understanding other than that I have nothing else to say about this company good hours and great pay the other employees were friendly it just management that was was very rude

good,"Flexible schedule, stressful workload, very fast paced environment. Management changes very often. High retention ratios. Work culture is dull but quiet."
good,The work was steady they offered full-time hours with overtime available. Decorating was accetable for holidays. It was a sit down computer job data entry as well as customer service.
good,"I moved through positions but we needed more help with management. I was the only supervisor for 40 agents.  I had a lot on my plate, although I handled it."
good,"Numerous job classifications, which enable one to experience a variety of tasks. One could try to become proficient in more than one category, or could choose to only work in one area."
good,"A good company  to work for. They provide plenty of support and good management. Even though my role was subcontracted so I didn't work within the Xerox office, I was still always included in the atmosphere with regular visits from management and emails letting me know what is going on within the company. The role had good hours and good pay for an entry level job."
good,"Es una planta pequeña, pero muy agradable para trabajar."
good,The opportunities for learning and advancement were tremendous. I started as a Credit Rep and ended as Marketing Support Manager. Business Operations is a wonderful environment.
good,"If you're looking for security while going to school or just need something you can clock in and clock out, this is the place to be.  The management up to the GM are all very approachable.  "
good,"Management is friendly and most coworkers are in a good mood. Everyone is willing to help if you have questions and their trainers are very skilled. The only complaint, and the reason why I am leaving, is because they have lowered the compensation they are giving to their sales representatives. To the point where it is just over $10/hr out of my pocket."
good,"It is a good place to work, when you need a job.  I was very happy to"
good,Xerox is too hung up in the culture it created in the 70's.  Management is slow to make decisions that help you do your job.  I enjoyed the people but the culture was a complete disaster.
good,"Xerox is a long standing legacy document company. Originally just in the copy business they have expanded and evolved to include electronic document management as well. During my time with Xerox I have learned many skills from technical service to customer care. They offer extensive online training courses on various topics. At a corporate level Xerox is much like most large companies with quarterly earnings driving most decisions. Workplace culture varies as many employees are working independently at client sites. So much of the culture is derived from there."
good,"Review Apple online orders and monitored deliveries"
good,"comenzaba el dia revisando el correo electronico por ese medio sabia de mis tareas, las ejecutaba, luego enviaba correo reportando la falla, administraba el stock de insumos, realizaba pedidos de partes."
good,"I would answer between 100-150 calls per day in a call center. I learned how student loans really work. The Management was pretty good. They had employee appreciation day about every 4 months. You got little gifts, free donuts and they had a raffle with about 25 or more prizes. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate loan holders who wanted you to tell them how to payoff their loans, while maintaining their lifestyles. The most enjoyable part was helping someone understanding how loans work."
good,I worked at Xerox for 4 years and it was the most significant contribution to my development as a sales professional and I appreciated the opportunities I was given.
good,"The old fabled Xerox of yore is apparently gone. But, it was a company with a richly ingrained company culture that my manager described as ""family"".Thanks Ursula Burns."
good,"Extensive Windows Admin background required, exemplary people skills required. Project Management and SDLC background required. Manage project team to deliver web based treasury functionality and problem resolution. I learned my project management and LSS skills . The management provided guidance and support . The workplace culture was relaxed and fast paced. The most enjoyable part of this job was the satisfaction of delivering a web based solution that was reliable and satisfied corporate goals. The hardest part was dealing with the software vendor and their lack of appropriate responsiveness to issues."
good,"Empresa multi nacional, onde atuei no setor de cobrança, um setor que tinha tudo para ser estressante, eles conseguiam fazer a diferença, tinhamos muitos incentivos para atingir metas, eram realizadas muitos eventos onde estavam todos envolvidos, alem de premiações tanto individuais como em grupo."
good,I learned a lot at Xerox it was a very welcoming nice work atmosphere that I would recommend anyone to work at. I  enjoyed helping and assisting the callers
good,"The staff made this environment a good place to work, with the role producing new challenges regularly. It was engaging and allows me to work with different departments."
good,Good work life balance. Committed to recruiting and retaining quality employees. Sometimes too many levels of management and not enough employees to actually do the work. I was probably underpaid for what I was doing in the industry
good,"It was fun working in the company, it was just that  the job itself, Iwas so toxic. I needed to undergo an operation due to the toxicity of the job. "
good,"When I was there we had lots of documents to scan and make digital copies which can make your day go super fast, but unfortunately it started to slow down and there was noting else to do"
good,"Good opportunity, good friendship and good experience support Thai only, several kinds of customer for Apple product "
good,A lot of contact with customers and a different reaction from customers. Expectation was very high. Each day came with different positive ways of dealing with issues.
good,"I was just a slow paced desk job, it is quick pace when its dealing with the customers, but other than that it was just relaxed and slow paced. The hardest part of the job was the hours and the number of reservations you are suppose to have, but at the same time the hours add up to a nice amount of hours and its worth it"
good,"Great co-workers and team environment. Management was good. Everybody seemed like family. The hardest part of the job was grasping some of the company based computer issues and satisfying angry student loan borrows, but overall was a good place to work. Most enjoyable part of job was knowing that at the end of the day, you pleased the customers."
good,"Overall this place of employment was the most stressful, however it rewarded the hard workers and has amazing benefits. Definitely learned a lot from this work environment."
good,"While working there for such a long time, the supervisors and leadership took the time to help give us the tools necessary to advance. The company itself, I never had contact with anyone other than the people who worked in the call center itself."
good,Not a bad company to work for.  I enjoyed the people that I worked with and for.  If you want t succeed here you will.  All you ave to do is go to work mind your own business and go how.
good,"My manager was awesome always available to assist business very understanding about personal issue"
good,ok work place not the best management director makes mean comments about people too many kids to effectively take care of them no place for advancement
good,"Care about employees' development"

good,Très bonne et enrichissante expérience sur le marché des petites et moyennes entreprises.
good,"Calls were in your que and you traveled."
good,This was a good job with a good management staff that really cared about you..There was a lot of stress because  these people needed their medication and I did everything in my power to get their medication
good,"This was my first job out of college, it was good experience and helpful in making me decide to go forward with this career path. It was just unfortunate the company site had to close."
good,"Membre du CODIR, responsabilités, managériales satisfaisantes et motivantes."
good,I started out fresh at the new call center in highlands ranch. It was a good environment. Great motivation and instructors. Good pay. I'm not sure about the benefits.

good,"I love learning new things, I Enjoy working with other people and learn from one another. I like to stay  busy and active. The hardest part of my job is not working as team, the thing I love the most about my job is being able to help however I can."
good,It was an okay job at the time. I just needed the money for my family. Some of the female coworkers were catty. But the job itself was great and very beneficial.
good,"The contract I had was steady and allowed me to focus on work and listen to music..keep my pace and be productive.  The grading scale for piece rate, however, was unthinkable; even seasoned QA personnel scoffed at it.  The management I adored; easy to talk to and worked with you on ABSOLUTELY any issues that you had.  If you had family or medical issues they would work your schedule around it and be there to help in any way possible.  That part I will definitely miss."
good,I enjoyed working with my direct team. My team managers were engaged and kept the team rolling meeting the client's high expectations. Our client gave the team rave reviews for out work.
good,"I loved my job when i worked at Xerox. It was a great enviornment to work in. A Typical day at work consisted of helping customers, and being on the phone."
good,This was a great experience.  I was expecting while I was at this job.  The stress level was high. The calls were stressful because you have to make the member's problems your own during each call.
good,I learned to listen more and focus on finding the actual problem. I enjoy my job its a bit stressful at times but its not difficult.
good,Xerox is a good place to work. You learn several different skill sets and you are helping the elderly with their health benefits and needs. My biggest issue with working for the company was the continuous threats of losing my job over minor performance issues.
good,Good work for employees daily with great growth opportunity. Learning multiple channels of what can help clients. Great team of managers for awesome workplace and positive culture. Not enough time in the day to help as desired. Most teams and building of teams to support our clients needs.
good,"Xerox is an excellent organization on many fronts.  Like many other organizations, they struggle with training and communication.  Sometimes there's too much communication and sometimes none at all.  Willingness to support remote work is fantastic, but may also contribute to communication gaps."
good,"Working at xerox is wonderful, its filled with good people and great leadership. Pay for all duties is on point but it does get really slow at times and can take a big effect on your biweekly checks."
good,Input data for county courthouses daily. Key and verify legal documents recorded and uploaded on the computer. Production is very important in area documents must be keyed and verified by a certain time
good,"I actually worked here twice. The first time I was hired away by the competition.  I was rehired, went back to the same team, then I was laid off after 5 months."
good,Overall a good place to work but improvements to the facility are needed. There is a high turnover rate but there is competitive pay and opportunities for advancement. The hardest part of the job is the lack of time between calls. the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to assist customers in important matters.
good,"A good place for work/life balance.  Opportunities exist to advance, but only to a certain extent.  "
good,its been a working plue learning phase with HCL. XEROX is the project that was assigned. always shared good bonding with the team and manager.

good,"You can excel quickly in this company if you do your job well. However everyone has their little packs and clicks even down to the higher ups; supervisors, work leaders etc"
good,"Politique et valeurs de l'entreprise "
good,same as the last review I did nothing has changed about how I feel towards Xerox could have handled somethings better but overall they are ok

good,"This was a short term contract position but I really enjoyed the work and the learning experience with Provider Credentialing for Colo Medicaid. I really enjoyed working with my Supervisor. If I had a chance to work for this Team again, I would not hesitate. Contract position therefore no benefits were provided."
good,"Nice place to work. I only went through some of the training, it was short but good. I really enjoyed the training session. The trainer was really dedicated to the workers and wanted to ensure everyone grasped the material. Beautiful cafeteria and a wide choice of snacks to choose from.

good,"Highly engaging during a deal cycle"

good,"Xerox overall is a typical Call Center the Culture is determined by yours as well as the people around you attitudes. My experience has been very good, although I feel as though it is time for me to venture out to find something that will help me grow more professionally."
good,"The place is really taken care of, the people are different and yet some are great (co-workers) And the supervisors are great but the favoritism in the job is wrong."
good,"Xerox is a good company to work with however, all assisgnment seems to be project based and permanent opportunities are very rare."
good,I enjoyed coming to work everyday. I was sad that it came to an end. I learned a lot. They offered training and a lot of jobs no longer offer that.
good,"Its a good workplace to learn the new things and management skills."
good,"Ik denk dat niemand een droom heeft om in een callcenter te werken... De hele dag naar klachten luisteren vind niemand leuk. wat dan erg belangrijk is, is dat er goed met het personeel wordt omgegaan. Dat is hier zeker het geval."
good,"I worked as a contractor full-time at Xerox in Akron, Ohio. This job was not going to be long term, however while I was with the company I found a great, helpful team of coworkers. "

good,"the management is at times very inconsistent with policies and understanding of their responsibilities, and not much chance for advancement as origniallty promised, but overall, a decent place to work"
good,Xerox is a great place to work. there are some things I would change as far as management and the lack of communication. I would recommend employment.
good,You need to focus on what task is  given to you.I learned how to handle to that is necessary for me to be better. The hardest part of the job is when your name is called because you got an error on some documents that need to be correct. I enjoy listening music while the others are talking loud and funny things.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Xerox, I was there on time and I learned a lot there and the management team made it possible for me to understand everything in training"
good,It is a repetitive job that can be challenging at times. There is not much room for job advancement. My co-workers are the best part of my day.
good,"fun place to work most of the time, and the location was great if you are a people person. Xerox offer a lot of training and classes. However they may not help when it comes to promotions but it just might help you on another job."
good,"If you're looking for a place that is laid back and you always have manageable work to complete, Xerox is the place to succeed. "
good,"Friendly and professional staff."

good,"I Worked on the Sprint account for Xerox and they expected us to get a five star review for how customers feel about service with Sprint (which they hated but they were locked in a 2yr contract with them) and if they gave a bad rating then it fell back on us not ""doing our job correctly"" but we couldn't help that people was not getting service in their area it wasn't our fault and there was nothing we could do about it"
good,Xerox is a great employer to work for as well as a friendly environment to work in. The management is very professional and very friendly.
good,"My first position here was so much fun and I felt appreciated by my supervisor! I enjoyed working with Enterprise Car Rental customers. Once transferred to another department I felt pressured to be perfect and witnessed unethical treatment of several employees. However, my trainer for that department was very motivating and always encouraged her class to succeed!"

Aprendi a compartir mas a fondo con gente mas joven que yo. En realidad no existio o no pude captar en ese corto tiempo alguna deficiencia extrema en la dificultad de el trabajo...buen lugar para elaborar, me gusto mucho el ambiente de camaradismo y liviano de la compañia."
good,"this compnay isvery stressful to work for, however it is a great job if you just need something. it is very confusing working here, the supervisors don't even know the correct answer and the answers always change without notice"
good,"I feel like the training and all that we do is very insightful, nevertheless, the compensation that is given to the advisers is truly unacceptable. One cannot live and further themselves truthfully with that low stage of compensation. To receive 10 an hour for all that we do and to base it upon the response of some random customers is truly ridiculous. You cannot punish someone for what another interprets to be true. Many cases it is true but some times it's just unfair. The job itself is nice to work at. I have learned how to troubleshoot and handle many matters within the company."
good,"Local típico e dinâmico no período da manha efetuava o recebimento de veículos no atendimentos na parte de expedir material e recebimento do mesmo."
good,"I had a difficult time sitting for long periods. Overtime was really tough on me physically. But the management was really great, coworkers were super. I would not hesitate to work there again, except for the sitting that I detested. Most jobs require you to be very fast with typing because they pay according to that. If you can sit for 8-10 hrs.and sometimes on Saturdays, you will be fine."
good,"• Gather information, research inquiries and log detailed notes of customer interaction,                                   "
good,xerox work culture is good. work life balance is great. There are opportunities to learn new technologies and apply the same to the business.
good,"I enjoy working at Xerox. The work place is constantly changing each and everyday as the company take on new ventures.  The opportunities are good for new employees.  Because the growth is so rapid and things change so fast, mass hiring creates good opportunities for promotions. As a quality assurance analyst, our expertise in work instructions and policy make us a resource in high demand.  My position enable me to come in contact with many employees.  The hardest part of my job is trying to interpret policies that are sometimes very vague in nature. The most enjoyable part of the job is playing a role in the growth and development of employees. Management  is very flexible and creates an environment full  fun and incentives."
good,You will never know until you work for them. Great entry-level occupation to pay for the bills & for those looking to start work with a company with some benefits.
good,"In the time worked at Xerox I learned how a company works globally and how to deliver services at a high level and quality. I started in Learning - operations and I have been promoted as a Trainer and Quality Assurance analyst due to my good results and proper skills."
good,"nice size cubicles, and management was very nice and informative. the company at the time were switching a lot of their contracts, so permanent employees did not like that too much. I was assigned there for 3-6 months and did a total of 4. the hours were flexible but they were not 24 hours at the time, not too sure if some contracts are now. it was a very mixed race of people and for the most part it was a nice place to work. the work was repetitive. I was on the Kentucky account. daily job was to register customers for Obamacare during open enrollment and provide basic HMO information. notate the accounts and thats its. a pretty ice call center environment. not filled with drama as most are, but theres always something juicy to know or talk about; just as any other job."

good,"Hinduja Global Solution has the good work environment. All the employees in HGS will love to work in it."
good,"Employees are empowered.  However, senior management may bases their decision making on personal opinions and not skill-set.  However, a few bad seeds don't set the tone for the organization.  Overall, Xerox is a good company to work for."
good,"Actually there's no such thing as easy work because we should start from hardest to easy until we know what kind of work we have. I have learned that when your inside the office premises we should follow rules and regulations so that we could be a better employee. The management to be honestly its average because sometimes we don't understand the leaders there with there behavior. My workmates are fun and enjoy but sometimes we could not force them to like us so we should accept the fact people are not all the same whether they like us or not but of course we will just enjoy our stay. The hardest part of job i think its only from the start because sooner or later we will know what we are doing. The most enjoyable is that having special days, weekends or months such us Christmas party and other holidays, also having friends inside the office."
good,"A typical day at Xerox is very calm and easy. Management is always there when needed, even on a busy day full of meetings. I enjoy my coworkers. There's always some laughter to lighten the atmosphere."

good,"While Xerox can be strict and yes I wont dent cliques run the show in Xerox SJ. I was blessed with a high rate of pay coming in the door. Now this was only due to a new program being launched. I began at 14.50 where normally it would only be 11.00. "

good,"so far is a very stable company that offers an stable job and takes care of the employees."
good,A typical day at work would be me handling over 130 calls throughout the day assisting customers with their banking needs and answer any questions that the customer just might have. I've learned how to take control of the call and build a strong report with customer. The management team is such a strong and influential aspect of the job they don't let your hard work go unnoticed my co-workers are the coolest if you need help or assistance with anything they are always there to help. The hardest part of my job is assisting a customer's account that has already been closed and the branch refuses to reopen customer's account. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to assist the customer in what they need.
good,"Wds is nice place to work where you will be able to learn a great deal of things. Every day you have a new challenge to face which is enjoyable because your time run away. Your colleague are going to help you and make easier you welcome to the company, to be honest there is a friendly atmosphere between the staff. The managers are really good professional and focus on performance."
good,Eu conseguir boa adpatação no ambiente de trabalho em todos os aspéctos.
good,"I've learned a lot from Xerox, and I appreciate all the opportunities that have been given. The most enjoyable part about being part of Xerox's management team is coming in twork on a daily basis seeing all the smiling faces. My co-workers are of all different races and we mesh very well. We make a great team."
good,"the job is okay, they need an more strict environment for supervisors.  The workplace has to be something we look forward to everyday so that we can work at our best."
good,"Take calls from customers, fix their problems (I personally hate the phrase ""resolve their issues""), attempt to sell and this place will treat you right. Sales bonuses can be substantial but you have to work for it. Opportunities to advance within the company are plentiful. Hardest part of the job is not the job but finding parking. Best part is the people."
good,"Managers are supportive,work life balance,compensation needs to be improved.Cutting edge technology,you get good work to do which gives you good learning curve."
good,"atencion al cliente, desarrollar buen trato con clientes y el mismo equipo de trabajo."
good,I learned after working for this company for about 6 years - that a person should attempt at all costs to further their education. Or at least everyday concentrate on some type of training. You do not want to find yourself going in circles on jobs that simply may not pay you what you need. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you are able to sit down and perhaps drink coffee while you work. The hardest thing about the job is not being able to help a customer to get what they really want.
good,"Work hrs flexible "
good,Taking inbound calls for medicaid. Answering questions about services and history for providers and clients as well. Taking more then 100 calls a day

good,"I have been in the customer service industry for more than 10 years and the things I learned over the years made a who I am today. I have learned and lived my the saying ""It is not what you say but how you say it."" At first, it was hard to transform or deliver a negative result by having it say in a positive way."
good,I have great co-workers and supervisors. Everyone works together very well.
good,"Work hours were 8-5 but there were few nights that didn't require me taking work home with me. "

good,"c'est un travail qui es intéressant , on apprend beaucoup de choses , de la polyvalence ."
good,Company was very different on how the did there daily functions. Had to adapt to changes very quickly or get left behind. Job taught me to adapt to many different personalities to make sure that we were all on the same page to get the job done.
good,"Working for Xerox was not a bad experience. I worked for Sprint doing troubleshooting, billing, and dealing with various phone plans. Sprint has a large database, so learning their system is not hard but time consuming. Once I learned the system it was easier for me to resolve customer issues. Management was excellent,  great at diffusing situations and  knowledgeable of the product. Breaks were decent 30 min to 1hr, break room was nice the building serves breakfast and lunch with plenty of snack and coffee machines to keep you energized through out your shift."
good,A typical day at work involves helping others while also being introduced to new information. There is always room to grow and learn in this work enviroment. Being open to change could take you to great places!

good,"Selling Apple brand products the company taught us all about the products.  We were the 1-800-APPLE source for phone sales, tech support and information.  We learned sales techniques and used them to enhance the buying experience for Apple customers.  They used computer programs to determine our pay and advancement opportunities based on our tone of voice and enthusiasm on each call.  Mid-level management was supportive of our efforts to sell,  acknowledging the flaws in the computers used to compensate us.  Constant phone calls provided a non-stop work experience each day requiring a high level of energy."
good,It decent as long as you do ur work.The more positions you get I believe they should increase ur pay.
good,"Working at Xerox has its ups and downs. Most days work was fun others not so much. Working at Xerox and Sunshine Liquors help me to be a calm person. Talking to rude customers, with a smile on my face not thinking about answering them but helping each customer solve their problems the quickest way possible. I learn that you have to take each day at a time, learn to smile now and then. Management could have been better, there is a communication issue. There are ways to correct a person without shouting. Co-workers were fun, but sometimes there is more talking than work being done. The hardest part of the job was not get enough time to eat, everything was done in a hassle.  The most enjoyable part about work was hearing a customer say thank you for a job well done and the relationship we had has a team. Once we solve a problem we celebrate as a team."
good,I'd work here again. I liked talking with strangers all day.
good,"Customer was angry concerning her bill, customer stated, that she was leaving cell service and going to another service.

good,Work is always challenging and that I can learn something new every day which is always a challenge. It provides the ability to see all aspects of a job function even if it isn't a part of your job. If you want to learn all you have to do is ask.
good,"A typical day at work consists of reviewing medical records, making phone calls, and handling any provider inquiries and escalation calls.  I have learned the Medicaid guidelines for the state of Florida and about HIPAA violations.  My manager is one of the best managers that I've had.  My co-workers and I get along great and the work atmosphere is great.  The hardest part of my job is the fact that I'm the only one in my department that knows how to do majority of the role so therefore a lot of my day is interrupted.  So, it leaves me feeling that I'm doing the majority of the work and am underpaid.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with people and knowing that at the end of each day I've given my all to each provider that I've spoken to."
good,Good company to work for if you get the right manager.  The product line is extensive which works well when finding a solution for a customer.  Flexible financing available for clients.  Excellent product traiing and demo facilities.

good,"I am not going to provide a review of Xerox Corp."
good,A typical day as a Sr. Customer Service Representative at the office would be taking inbound calls and making outbound calls. I assisted many students as to what  financial aid documents where needed in order to process their financial aid because of the nature of this job I was required to be very detailed and oriented when speaking and assisting the student. In addition to this as a Transaction Processor I learned mapping skills adjusting financial aid awards. For this job I performed numerous tasks that required micro-soft word and excel spread sheet and many other numerous functions with data entry.  My performance had to be 100% at all times. I really enjoyed assisting and problem solving some of the issues and concerns the students had I was happy to help them to their satisfaction.

good,I have enjoyed my tenure at Xerox although it is sometimes difficult to be promoted. It is a big company and there is a lot of quality competition for open spots.
good,"I sat at my work station and entered data into fields for auto insurance medical claims. I learned to type faster and to keep my accuracy at a great level. My manager was a really good guy and a very fair boss. The hardest part of my job was the stress of making sure you kept your accuracy up and your speed up because that's how you were paid. I also liked that part of it though, you were paid based on the work that you completed."
good,"My activities were the followings"
good,Typical day at work is me sitting in a cubicle entering in numerous amounts of data. Includes me answering phones and helping customers.
good,"Good place to work, people are friendly and will help you navigate the hectic environment."
good,"I start my day with signing on my computer, stacking boxes of documents for review. Through out the day I use multiple systems to search for information related to documents I am auditing. Once the information is compared paper vs. imaged documents I pass or fail the documents and place the information onto a spreadsheet and upload to client for final review. My quota is 8-10 boxes per day to meet monthly standards. I work with a team of auditors to complete the audit on a daily schedule. My coworkers are great to work it but we have our disagreements and work through them. Communications from the management team and involvement could be better, that's the hardest part of the job."
good,"A typical day in a contracted securities companies work environment is no typical day at all. The approach to a day in this type of environment is rather to approach it as a new experience every day. The position of Fleet Analyst was more of a managerial and liason between the University of Missouri Hospitals environments, management, and staff. As well as an I.T. Team Leader, Trainer, Optimization Specialist, Programmer, and I could go on for days boring you with details. Just know that it was an important building block for the Xerox Corparation and U.M.H.C. and it's vast networking and data infrastructure. I am Proud to have the experience and will take it into my next carrer choice."
good,"Before we start our duty we have a meeting lets say about 30 mins., we talk about sales target.the most exciting part of these job if we reach the target for that month we recieve commission.Christmas season they are giving our 13th month pay and bonus"
good,"On a typical day at work I was responsible for overseeing about 15+ employees. I was responsible for making sure our workflow production was flowing correctly. I was responsible for taking mandatory classes quite often. We had to take ethics training on a yearly basis. I was also required to take management courses. There  was one manager over me. I mainly managed the employees, ordered supplies, overseen the workflow, and lastly dealt with the customer one on one. I overseen 15 employees. Some could be difficult while others were a pleasure to work with. For the most part they were a great bunch of people. The hardest part of my job would be managing employees that were once your friends. The most enjoyable part was you didn't work under a lot of pressure. It was a fun place to work."
good,This is great place to work if you can work independently and navigate through bureaucracy. Salaries are not that great but not bad either. Work Culture is very flexible.
good,"Outside sales for Xerox is very straight forward. Cold calling throughout the day, meeting and networking with new people and organizations to build a relationship and make sales."
good,"Taking about 50 calls a day, I've learned alot about insurance and manage care organizations, the management has a open door policy, a very pleasant management staff, My co-workers are all very polite, the hardest part has yet to come...I think the transition to new location and learning systems will be the hardest part....My location where i am now is the best part of the job"

good,Learned how to resolve customer issues for cell phone devices and products. Loved being friendly to customers and building rapport. Had a wonderful environment.
good,"This is a small group of a larger, global company. Unfortunately, they support Sprint, which is a tenuous position at best. The management basically checked out, the people who were supposed to oversee the work of those who did the work didn't know what they were doing. The group may have a chance now, as the person they've put in charge of the team is FABULOUS, unfortunately, I got laid off before he had a chance to start working."
good,"A typical day at work is taken calls , building rapport, making customer comfortable. i learn to make the customer happy and you will have a good rep resolve score. Management is there with support as much as you need it.  My co-workers are helpful when there is no management around the team steps up.   The hardest part of my job is when im not able to come up with an solution for the issue. My most enjoyable part of the job is to hear how excited they are, by how much i helped then resolve their issues."
good,"I worked for Xerox for a very short time. I originally started with the Company when it was known as AFSA. In the 17 years that I was employed, the company changed a few different times. All in all, I enjoyed working there and I enjoyed my co-workers."
good,This job was okay at the beginning but after a few years there was no advancement at all.
good,"I make, change and cancel airline reservations. I sign guests up for our frequent flyer program. Assist in locating missing reservations and applying them to the frequent flyer account. I learned to be an active listener. My co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is getting cursed at by a total stranger. I feel that people take advantage of you being on the phone and then just use poor manners. I do find this as a BIG challenge. Let me put on a big smile on my face and in my voice. Just turn it all around. One call resolution is my motto."
good,"Answering phones for the CVS/pharmacy ExtraCare program was satisfying in many ways.  Helping people find savings, or retrieve helpful information about the program, ultimately left me smiling at the end of every day.  I learned a lot about the ExtraCare program, of course, but also about customer interaction and the importance of communication.  I didn't interact with my co-workers as much as I would have liked, but I enjoyed what time I did have.  The hardest part of the job was knowing what was and wasn't consumer-ready information, as there was a lack of clarity in communication."
good,"Planned activities. "
good,Everyday was fill with different experiences. I learned alot from my co-workers. Management was very flexiable when it came down to completing a task that you were assigned to. I felt like my co-workers were just like my family. When a another co-worker and I worked alone because of a very bad snow storm. Laughter all of the time.
good,"Typical day at work:"

good,"I was a customer service rep for an insurance company. I would overlook accounts making sure their claims were processed correctly, if not i would issue out a ticket; explaining the process and their insurance coverage also. There was also transportation we provided and i enrolled/ removed these benefits when asked while providing professional customer service. My co-workers and managers helped the day go by when it was slow."
good,Major Basis transition project was a great chance to update and improve my skills.
good,A typical work day it is taking calls a day it was required fifty calls have the best attitude. I have learned that not all people  are the same but its great way to learn from them. My co workers they are pretty nice and vey help full. one of the things i hated at work it was the points when we missed.
good,Analyzing accounts to help customer understand the billing and placing customers on valuable plans depending on the usage and income
good,"Each day at Xerox I would go in and log onto a computer, put my headset on and wait for customer calls to come in.  I learned a great deal about the PAIR process to be ble to help customers with troubleshooting issues with their devices. The management at Xerox was great, my direct supervisor made me feel that coming to him with any questions or concerns would never be a problem. My direct supervisor was always easy to find and knowledgeable about the products we were troubleshooting. The hardest part of the job was helping to troubleshoot when our systems were down. I feel that as I learned the products better it would have been easier to troubleshoot without our systems. The most enjoyable part of the job is simply being able to help customers. I mean from the angry ones that don't know a thing about technology. It was very satisfying to be able to get an issue resolved. A lot of times it takes fixing the customer then fixing the issue. Overall it was a wonderful position. I just need something home based that I am able to control my working environment. Using headsets that other people used caused me to get a tremendious amount of ear infections"
good,"1. A typical day at Xerox for me was to review previous performance to target (e.g. daily, monthly, and annual), set daily targets  and make and receive sales and customer service calls.   Monthly and quarterly bonuses and  vendor spiffs offers as incentive were offered to met and exceed goals.  Also, top performers meeting revenue goal were invited President's club with a chance to a  trip an exotic place for employee and a partner. "
good,On a typical day I would arrive to work and take attendance by walking around to my agents work stations to get a visual count of who was absent or present. I would then check for any voicemails that I received. I would check my email to see if their were any things needed from my boss and take care of it. I would then began listening to calls and provide coaching feedback to my agents and to close the day I would do payroll.
good,"Working at xerox has given me more of an opportunity to further my knowledge of customer satisfaction. With the skills I've learned, I was able to bring those skills to the customers on a daily basis. Each day to me was a challenge, but working with my co-workers as well as the customers, it made my day easier & enjoyable.Though management was somehow lapsed, the customers was pleased with my performance."
good,"Fuji Xerox Phils. is a one good company to work with,it provided basically the needs and career growth as well where basic knowledge were sharpened and honed as time went by.it provided constant trainings and seminars about new products and other work related things such as logistics,leadership seminars etc.it had a somewhat large workforce in the entire country and i had no problem interrelating with co workers for they had been supportive in work related situations and the ease in approaching them had been a pleasant way to solve a work related porblem.these are the factors that anyone could be satisfied and enjoy while working and i believe it made me happy during my stay at this company for 11 years."
good,"The best part about this company is the people. World class professionals working together learning from each other. It is a very large team. You have the opportunity to network with people from all over the world and the opportunity for advancement is only limited by your own ambition. Every day is a learning experience. There is great support for advancing your learning as well in the form of elearning courses and even supplemented university if applicable to your position. The managers are a part of the leadership team. They do not work above you, they work beside you. Everyone is always willing to listen to a new perspective or idea. The hardest part of working for this company in my position is simply bandwidth. As with most companies Xerox tends to stretch its resources thin, but this also is a developmental opportunity. The best part of this job is the developmental opportunity. You can literally go anywhere you want working for Xerox and the people you work with will be amazing. Xerox hires great people and its an honor to be part of their team."
good,"A typical day is filled with consulting with executive level customers and business development manager to assist in crystallizing the use of a new or an existing advanced business technology solution bundled in a managed services offering as well as managing on-going development, pilot-testing, and live implementation of advanced solutions. I learned a lot about project management, technology integration and just working with different vendors in creating new viable business solutions for the marketplace. The hardest part of the job is balancing finding an off-the-shelf solution that somewhat fits a critical customer requirement against the time to create a custom fit solution. I enjoyed working with great people with open minds to innovation and focused on the big-picture - customer satisfaction."
good,"Great place, good people, but a bit iffy when it comes to management."
good,I like the working environment. I get alone with everyone. I've learned so much from working with all kinds of people
good,The day usually starts with unloading and unpackaging machine parts and components for mounting on a palette.

The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers, and the most enjoyable part of the job are the people that I work with."
good,"Xerox is a strong company that is caught in the throes of redefining itself. Historically a technology company, Xerox is moving toward becoming a service business, selling its services to other well established companies. When working in the training and publications groups, I was working with the crem-de-la-creme; they were at the tops of their individual and group casts. We were well managed and treated as professionals at every level.With a total of 35 years at Tektronix/Xerox, it was fun and challenging to watch both companies deal with the continuous change needed to adapt to the ever-changing markets."
good,Nice company when I joined them; found that this varied by the people who ran the department.
good,its okay... But I am looking for something more personal for me.

good,"I learned quite a bit from this job. How to drive a fork truck,using power tools, learned about the importance of recycling to make money. I enjoyed making new friends.The one thing I hated was just the toner from the machines that would get on you from the copying machines. The managers were just doing their jobs.I had perfect attendance for 10 plus years. Every day was different. Sometimes I would have to do someone else's job because if an employee didn't show up and the work had to get done.Start work at6, every two hours we have a break ,with a half hour lunch,and get off at 3:00. As far as co-workers, I had great ones,however,everybody you meet is not going to be your friend.I enjoyed learning different parts of the job."
good,A typical day at Xerox consist of answering inbound calls from customer with problems with their cellular devices. My co-workers were very friendly and willing to help me with any questions I had. The hardest part about the job was taking the test after every training week.

good,"Fast paced environment, rewarding and satisfying. A fun environment to work in and learn."
good,"It was very easy to get on with the company but because it is a higher paying call center, it's a call center all the same and therefore, no matter how well you do your job, if you make a few mistakes or have too many absences for medical reasons, you will be fired. Not to mention the fact that when their funding is low, they reduce and lay off workers"
good,Take inbound calls and troubleshoot wireless devices. Make changes to customer's accounts and throughly documents actions taken on customer's accounts.
good,"My typical work day isn't very challenging, and doesn't use my skill set to its fullest.

good,*Deliver printed products to clients
good,The company ACS (prior to Xerox) had good benefits. Like most organizations have different line organizations and if down in an area outside of the managment areas (Washington D.C) not a lot of room for advancement or movement.

They have the best sales training in the industry, and working for them in a mid sized market as an agent is provides a wealth of experience. As an early developmental step it was critical. We as agents were involved in putting together financing, prospecting, selling, implementing and training. There was a real sense of ownership of your patch and your clients. Xerox also has one of the more carnivorous sales cultures and teaches many survival lessons by necessity. You can't count on anyone at any level to do anything that isn't in their own interest. It is a real sharktank. But that is eye opening and these are valuable lessons even if some of them are things I know to avoid."

Sadly, Xerox abruptly lost its contract with Capital One which caused many employees to have to seek employment elsewhere with little to no warning."

good,I did enjoy  working for Xerox. If I have choice I would go back. I typical day would be busy helping customers answering there calls and fixing there issues with the phones. The hardest part is not being able to help them.
good,Love the workplace but salary increase (promotion) is goven once a year so if you are promoted you have to wait for the salary increase season to get it.
good,Its a good company to work for. They have excellent benefits. They work with your schedule if you have kids. They accommodate you by letting you eat at your desk when you have to work through your lunch.
good,"A typical work day is working in a fast past environment handling cash transaction, attention to detail and accuracy through out my 8.5 shift. Multitask, communication and customer service plays an important role on my job. Critical thinking, leadership, organizational and Management skills is very much needed.

I gained valuable experience working with databases, web and mobile applications, and Oracle. I think the way knowledge is passed around the company should improve. It was always frustrating reading about the next big product in the news before it had even reached the rest of the Xerox company."
good,Dealing with the issues of customers and their equipment along with other employees to reach the company goals and keep satisfied customers. Great place to work with good people to work with.

good,This job is great for someone looking for full time work. It is a lot hours that go into this job. The work atmosphere is good on the campaign I worked on.

good,"Xerox/Conduent is an awesome place to work. The Company itself is awesome. Everyone there is very helpful and friendly and you get all the training you need. Working at a call center can be difficult, and it is not for anyone, but the company itself is awesome."
good,"Management in my office is awesome! Always work with you regarding sick time, days off and are cognizant of family emergencies and functions.  Laid back and non-stressful."
good,Xerox is a great place to make good money and get great benefits. But it takes most of your day most shifts are 11am to 8pm and that the whole day. you do get 2 days off . dealing with customers you have to be patient with them and pretty much take what they say with a grain of salt.
good,I enjoy working and servicing the clients. answer hones and determine eligibility. assist with what other need and also perform odd task for supervisors
good,A typical hardworking day with plenty of opportunity for overtime hours if your desired them.  Wish there was more flexibility of when you could take your lunch break.
good,very customer friendly people to work with.  Employees had positive attitudes towards their jobs and were eager to get the job done and management was there to offer any assistance needed
good,"công ty có chế độ tốt , thời gian làm việc khoa học , lương tăng chậm và thấp"
good,Working at xerox was like any other call center: fast paced and poorly managed. The company has a lack of communication with its employs. The most enjoyable part of the job was it being so diverse.
good,"Great company that allowed me to have great opportunities working in 2 different contries."
good,"no consistency, lots of favoritism. They really do not give raises. Having to have your calls reviewed and QA'd is hard enough but they have gotten so much stricter on making 100%"
good,provides an friendly work environment and helps me to know my strengths through the rewards offered to me.securities provided were good and i enjoyed working there as a part timer

good,Process Oriented and good place to learn - started as a secretary and worked upto work controller where I used to manage the top accounts for dispatching parts and assigning field engineers.

good,Excellent place to grown as a young adult if you are continuously learning as a life long learner. Excellent in this regard as long as you adapt to change. Benefits and competitive pressures will keep adding to the dynamics.
good,Enjoyed working for the Company but did not agree with the downsize.  Forcing out employees with tenure and bridging on retirement. Learned many of the new printing and graphic applications. Hardest part was making sure the customer was happy with the end result.  Always enjoyed working with the people and just waiting to see what challenge the next day would bring.
good,The best part of my job was working with new customers and helping them identify and achieve goals to allow them to focus on core business. Xerox has great products and services so highlighting capabilities to customers through assessments and examples is easy to demonstrate why they are top in the market. They maintain ethical practices and governance's. Xerox also encourages and provides quarterly e-learning for all it's employees from frontline to upper management.
good,"well maintained office close to restaurants and malls.  Training usually provided and on the job training.  Hire both full time and "
good,The consistent name changes can make one feel a little in-nerved about stability.  Pay increases were stopped for employees which made it a challenge to keep employees motivated.
good,on a daily basis I would answer in bound calls related to sensitive cases about child support alimony and spousal support. two days out the week I would assist on escalated calls. Hardest part of the job was listening to stories and clients very emotional when their funds was in their accounts and knowing there was a family that may not eat for a few days. most enjoyable part of the job was the people I work with its like a family.
good,"Leuke collega's prettige werksfeer en goed salaris."

good,"Empresa acorde a lo que uno espera como trabajador, buen sueldo y excelentes cursos para mayor conocimiento."
good,"I told myself I would never work in a call center but this is not bad. We provide Health/Wealth fare; 401k, Pension and other benefits. Its quite a rewarding job to know that you are able to explain benefits to clients. A lot to learn in this company."
good,"A typical day at Xerox was pretty simple, you come to work on time, and fix customers problems. One thing I've learned is to always stay professional even when you feel like you can't. You may not always be able to fix every single problem but it is possible to make every customer happy by the end of speaking with them. It is very stressful and not for everyone."
good,I like the job overall good place to work dress code required learn new skills providing elders with there medicine and insurance
good,"A typical day consists of taking customer service calls from an inbound queue. Depending on daily call volumes and call types between 35-60 calls are taken per day per agent. Workload consisted heavily upon over the phone customer interaction, in turn teaching agents customer relation skills, escalated handling tactics, and advanced problem solving. The value of employees to the company was measured mainly by performance related stats and customer submitted surveys, thus leading to a culture based on a customer first experience. These requirements made the greatest challenge satisfying the customer fully, all the while maintaining all expected metrics for performance. However this also made solving a customer's concern all the more rewarding, especially with the help and support of fellow employees."
good,"I have been working at Xerox full-time (More than a year)"

good,Thoroughly enjoyed my 22 years at Xerox where I had a varied and rewarding career that taught me the inner workings of a large multi-national organisation. Excellent sales training programme
good,"Paid training, where you are literally taught everything you need to know. Your advancement depends on your progress and your initiative."

O dia a dia é bastante dinâmico com a execução de diversas atividades que uma multinacional exige de um colaborador, desde um profissional da recepção até um da diretoria."
good,"Xerox is a really a great company, but is challenged by the changes in the world due to the rapid pace of digitization and globalization. Difficulty with transforming to a service focused business have also caused many missteps in approach to the market. I have learned a great deal at Xerox and have worked with many large and small customers, locally, nationally and globally. I've received tremendous training in sales, consulting and management techniques that I will always use. I've met great people and have made lifelong interesting friends with amazing skills. Although I love Xerox, I feel that to continue my personal growth I should look to use my skills with companies with new offerings that leverage the needs of a changing world. A company that needs my skills to help them gain, retain and grow large customers, by delivering an excellent customer experience and real value. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with customers and exceeding them. The most difficult part has been dealing with silos of responsibility, internally at Xerox to deliver that positive experience. Because I'm so good at what I do and because Xerox is not growing, I've not been allowed to move up in an organization that has too much leadership for an ever declining market."
good,It is a fun work enviroment. Sometime it is hostile. Pays the bill and i get to talk to peopleYouwork woth 5 to 6 different systems and we had to track brakes. Overall a decent company to work with.

good,"It pays the bills, however, not a job for major growth. The way I see it, I'm there for this moment because I need to be but I will make a career out of as it is not that type of job."
good,"Good place to work if you want hours and starting pay was great, training program was great. You just need to realize that this job isn't for every one."
good,"At one time, this was a great company to work for.  It was still an honor to support and work with great people.  Our group was mostly virtual and we were able to show how our staff was still able to support 400+ sales representatives along with 40 + managers and Senior Vice Presidents."
good,Xerox offered opportunities for growth and development.  I was part of a solid Leadership team that truly cared about the success of the business and maintained high performance month after month.
good,a typical day at work is very fast paced. I have learned how to better my communication skills. There is a lot of micro management. My coworkers are very friendly concerning and helpful. The hardest part of the job is the time frames for calls and taking notes for the call in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the member's out and the early work hours.
good,"The workplace gives me challenges and it is fun to deal with everyone in the workplace. Works are done on a timely manner, efficiently and effectively. Management always make monthly meeting with staffs about the status of the entire work and future improvements."

Team work is the successes of the company and the group. I always try to keep an effective work relationship and encourage the participation and involvement. There are various occasions I got tremendous help from other departments and persons, and also, I am willing to assist anyone in their need for the success of the team."

Expectations are set to allow employees to work toward specific goals and objectives. Performance issues are dealt with in a way that allow a struggling employee the change to correct the problem and management offers assistance. Pay is fair, employees are rewarded if the expectations are met or exceeded. Benefits are very good. A very professional and fair work environment."
good,The leaders at Xerox really have an agent first mentality and truly strive to push your boundaries so that you can gain skills you may once thought unattainable. The support from your peers is unlike any other job as we consider each other like family. Xerox goes beyond and offers a food pantry for employees who need assistance and during the holiday season we donate to some local charities!
good,"An excellent work place with an ocean of opportunities. "
good,i have already accomplished a review for this company i just happen to work for them multiple times so thats all as an agent management is not the best they say they have your back but ultimately do not

good,"During my tenure with Xerox, I had a great working relationship with my boss and assistant manager. We complimented each other in every facet."
good,This was an excellent place to start off a call center career and overall career in customer service. Learned that you really need thick skin to help get through the day. I enjoyed the freedom of being myself when speaking to customers.
good,"Bij Xerox werken is goed kunnen luisteren en snel kunnen analyseren. Je werkt op computer systemen die zijn voorzien met kennisbanken en het is de bedoeling om de klant door het proces te helpen. Je krijgt te maken met diverse situaties aan de telefoon. Je leert hiermee om te gaan en weet daarna hoe je klanten op de juiste spoor kunt brengen door vragen te analyseren."
good,Good people to work with. Work life balance acceptable. Advancement was limited. Overall I had a memorable experience during my time with Xerox.
good,"This job is great for a call center type of position however the management is not very good a communicating between themselves or the employees. They have absolutely great benefits and are very good at making sure you understand your position the rules and how to do your job fluently. However they could definitely work on productivity and drugs in the work place. Even though you are required a drug test upon hire there was still a lot of drug talk, and selling happening between the employees that management was absolutely clueless about."
good,"de vrijheid met je werk."
good,"Honestly I can say that Xerox tries to make lemonade out of lemons.    Most of the time customers are wonderful and just need help, but the pure number of calls and dread of that one customer create a job place of apprehension and nervousness.  Xerox combats this with great incentives, fun games, and all around trying for the employee whenever they can.  The pay is decent but the bonus's are awesome, I only wish it wasn't so nerve racking."
good,el ambiente laboral en realidad es lo que hace excepcional a esta empresa
good,"Very friendly/family oriented."
good,The training was very good and prepared me fairly well for the position requirements.  The Apple iTune customers were very pleasant to work with.
good,I enjoyed the time I did spend at Xerox. I just wish the schedule would have been a little more flexible. other then that I have no real qualms with the job.
good,"Xerox has been fun to work for, but on the contracts I've had with them, its been hard to try to find a way to move up."
good,"Working through Xerox as a temp at Spectrum Health print department was a decent to good time. Every morning I would come into work and start my day with reading emails and organizing my daily task. Once that was done I would start making corrections, changes, or creating whole new documents for the hospital to use. I would make sure documents were set to go online for employee use once approved. Once online and approved I would file all documents away. This included anything that the 2 other employees who worked on the same things as me did along with anything that had been pulled to be printed. If anyone on the floor needed help with printing I would assist. Most days around 2pm I would work on the floor. "
good,"Excellent company for constant training and excellent  field support"
good,Enjoyably work environment with great co workers. Environment makes employees want to be there and work. The system was nice to work with as well.
good,There is always enough work and opportunities to improve my problem solving skills. It is a wonderful learning experience.
good,"Growing company--opportunity for growth in several departments.  Vendor site--embrace change.  "
good,"While working with Xerox, I had a wide range of duties and responsibilities. I helped Verizon Wireless customers with anything they had questions, comments, or problems with. This included going over monthly bills, adding/removing certain features, faulty device troubleshooting, and other concerns regarding their wireless cellphone plan. The hardest part of this job was deescalating customer frustration and getting to the core of their issue. The work environment was very positive and upbeat. I really loved hearing the relief from customers when I was able to fix whatever they were frustrated, concerned, or stressed out about."
good,"i liked working at Xerox, great enviorment and great employees."
good,Working with Xerox has been a very enlightening and rewarding experience. I have been able to continue to grow in my field while learning much more in other business aspects.
good,"A typical day when I joined this company. Great working inviornent."
good,"the people were nice and the customers were always a blast, family dollar helped me out with everything. It helped me build the skills, i have today"
good,"Empresa agradável de ser trabalhar , os benefícios são ótimos , mas as chances de crescimento são pequenas."
good,"While the atmosphere in the workplace is fantastic, the goals set are quite high. It isn't for the timid, or simple minded person looking for a quick buck. You have to stay on point with your skills, tone, and the ability to defuse situations with frustrated customers experiencing issues. This job was very rewarding, in that I finally got to experience life in the tech world. The fellow employees are the best part of the job. Ended up meeting so many like minded people that I had a blast working with. On the upper end, it was difficult to work with management and supervisors. They come off as your buddy, but then wont hesitate to throw you under the bus for no wrong doings. Write ups are common in this work place for people who don't meet the high metric standards. This is understandable except, when your being coached your told that you are doing everything right, and have nothing to be coached on. Yet, despite that you are still written up because they have to. Thankfully I didn't fall victim to this kind of treatment, but I witnessed it time and time again. I really believe that management should be written up when they fail to offer the support that is needed to meet such metrics. Most supervisors and managers did not come into the job from the ground up so they have no idea how difficult it is to meet these standards. They just want you to do it, or hit the road. Despite this, I saw it as a great challenge to succeed during my contract here, and I did a great job. I would work there again."
good,its a world of new things always come up. we have to work like a team and to be very flexible with schedule. nice team and management.
good,"I did Roadside Assistance for Alamo. I took anywhere between 15-50 calls a day. I learned effective communication when customers are in distress, empathy, and basic call center techniques. The management was usually reasonable, but when they were under stress, you could almost guarantee you were going to be, as well. I worked very closely with my Supervisor, and with the quality team. They did a pretty okay job with letting me know on a regular basis how I was doing. My co-workers were fun to work with and didn't bring a lot of ""drama"" to the workplace. The hardest part of this job was staying positive to customers, especially when sometimes you didn't know how their financial situation was going to end up [If a customer did not have coverage, the rental counter could basically charge them anything for a tow, there were times I did not have an answer for the customer other than ""Talk to your rental counter"", which as I'm sure you'd know, is highly ineffective.]. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I knew what to do and did it quickly, resulting in a happy customer and usually compliments from leadership."
good,"Support and troubleshooting of Xerox Copiers at the County of Los Angeles CA."
good,"I love my job and what I do. I love the people that I work with. Very friendly, professional, and fun environment. I love that I was able to help people and the get promoted to quality agent, so that now I am able to help the Customer Care advocates."
good,"the company was an indirect call center for verizon wireless when i first begin it was great the schedule, pay, and bonuses and then the changes start to happen they pay kept changing and the bonuses went away came back and the made it where it was harder to get it. i had great co workers and supervisors but i got tired of the pay changing and the different changes with the charges with verizon which would upset the customers. with supervisors one will tell you one thing and another would tell you something different. when the pay changed to surveys i thought that was very unfair because someone would fail you on an survey based on something verizon changed which it should be based on customer service from the rep, but over all it wasn't an bad job and it was easy."
good,I enjoy problem solving and I get to do it every day at this job.  The people I work with are very kind and supportive.  The management team is dedicated to our success and are extremely competent and dependable.  The hardest part of the job is the way things are constantly changing and the need to keep abreast of the changes.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of helping others.
good,"I liked the job because it was busy"
good,loved working there and was blessed for the extra training that was given to me. this is a great company to wok for. you will gain a lot of experience and knowledge.
good,I believe that Xerox is a great place to work. This is definitely a great company to gain some office experience and or skills. The turn around rate is pretty high. It becomes a little scary in terms of having permanent employment because you never know when you may be laid off. Xerox has great incentive programs and offers a lot of overtime during their open enrollment period.
good,This job required much travel for the City of Houston Account. Houston is a big city so this is understandable. People of the city of Houston account are very nice. This account is very hard to service due to the shortage of people but the teams all help to make sure that the account is serviced in a timely manner.
good,A great company to be a part of! Advancing is prominently expressed and is emphasized thouroughly in advancing in the company. Opportunity awaits those who pursue this company!!!

good,Xerox provides a fast paced work environment. Co-workers could possibly be a hassle. Management could be better but the effort is seen. The best part of the job is helping our members get the assistance that they need.

good,"Worked from home for Xerox since Jan 2015, and found the working conditions and support excellent. Remote access to the systems and applications have been smooth and seamless. Helpdesk support is timely, professional and effective, when required. "
good,"Xerox is a wonderful place to work. The work is very fulfilling and detailed. I really enjoy working here. Coming in on a day to day basis and knowing what you have to do, having the work load ready and consistant is one of the best things anout the position. Im a person thats likes to keep busy and Xerox understands that."
good,"I find the people i worked with there are very outgoing, it made you feel like part of a family. but the way the customers treat you is total garbage and i find that my time is better spent somewhere else. Nobody deserves to be talked to the way the customers talk to the reps there. On top of that, i felt as if i was neglected by my supervisor when i was out of training. I was put on a team where my supervisor left 3 hours before i did. Not only did i have nobody to help me out for 3 hours of my day. Almost the whole day she wasnt at her station, when i had questions nobody was there to help. When i had an angry customer wanting a supervisor she would tell me to wait a minuet and next thing i know, Every foul name in the book is being thrown at me 20min later because the customer thinks im not trying to help her because my supervisor is gone."
good,"vary productive and learning environment, you deal with many different call each and everyday which help you to learn a lot"
good,"this job was very simple, management is terrible at my location but the overall job was great. i am happy to come to work each day."

good,I learned to process healthcare claims from US clients and have a very good working relationship with my colleagues as well as supervisors. I learned to put balance quality and quantity of my work.
good,"Purely policy and process based with ITIL, lovely environment no micro-management and telecommute allowed. Support hours based on client mostly IST hours in India as we've office in other locations."
good,I loved working there at Xerox and I was really good at my job I am very fast with my hands for we got paid piece rate and not hourly I sorted mail and had to also type at times. Most of the coworkers were woman. The most I enjoyed about my job was my hours I got to come into work as early as I wonted and could leave when my 10 hours was up but of the time I stayed longer if there was things that needed to be done.
good,"Good place to work, you can grow within the company, pays good, nice environment to work in, as long as you remain focus on exceeding daily goals your fine"

good,Work life is balance in Xerox. I learnt a lot in Xerox. Safety for women is very important. Co - Workers are very helpful. I am a part of Testing Team there. I enjoy working there.
good,"A typical day at work is never ""typical"". I average about 40-60 req's at a time and they vary from senior level executives to entry level call center employees. I am responsible for the full recruiting cycle. I source, screen, interview, schedule follow up interviews with managers, create offers, and move the candidate through the entire hiring process (drug and background and onboarding). "
good,They value the people that work for them. Very flexible and open minded.  I also had wonderful work hours. Compensation was above par.
good,"nice people and place to work for, hours of work was good,hour for lunch i loved that..and management was nice to all people there, I learned alot"
good,Managed New and Existing business on an ongoing basis.  Worked with field reps and clients to ensure all aspects of services were customized per the customers specifications.  Delighting customers was and is the number #1 goal. The most satisfaction to the experience was in fact when you deliver a solution of services that meets or exceeds the clients expectation. The hardest part of the job is when you don't quite meet the expectation the first time.  The team consistently pulls together to make it right for the customer and the learning never stops that is what makes it exciting always.
good,"On a typical day an agent would receive 20-30 calls and he/she will always have support, the employees supported one and other. Great place to work although by the time i moved to alaska they were having some management problems."
good,"I feel I am dedicated to the task of assisting my fellow man in any positive capacity. As a youngster growing into adulthood I seem to gravitate towards helping those who could not or would not help themselves. I do this with pride respect and dignity, the keys that I feel are necessary to be a good decent and positive person in this life.

good,"The work experience was good but the thing that I didn't like was that, as a CSR, I didn't have much power to assist our members. There was not much I could do as far as replacing orders or getting members refunds on the spot for incorrect online orders. I felt like I wasn't doing my job but that came from management."

good,"a typical work day, was very busy, there was never a moment where I had nothing to do. which I loved. walking in to my computer and knowing what I had to do was great."
good,"While there were good benefits to the job, Xerox does not pay it's CSC's exactly what is deserved for the job. Also there is little to no room for upward mobility at all. They tend to hire managers from other projects, rather than giving agents the chance to move up the corporate latter."
good,A typical day at work would be to come in and evaluate calls from agents. Review processes and help others with their work.
good,"Empresa que da la oportunidad de crecimiento personal"

good,my work is cool all the days. my co-workers are very hard working. there is no hardest part in my job. The most enjoyable part of the job is auditing claim.
good,I have learned quite a deal about printing while working with xerox.  I have acquired new skills while at the UAH account that I am currently working at.  My co-workers and I all make a great team together and get along well.  The hardest part of the job is managing to complete jobs with very short turn around times.  The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting new people and the challenges of completing jobs that are different than others and finding that I can find solutions or a work around to complete those jobs on time and to the customers satisfaction
good,I have gained lots of knowledge in customer service and developed skills in order to handle various complaints.
good,I take phone calls all day long from customers and members for insurance. I helped them get there medication.
good,"A typical day at work for me entailed managing Critical Incidents and I worked Sunday through Thursday 20:00 until 05:00.  Management was initially great as I had a manager that believed in maintaining a work/ life balance, but eventually my manager changed and the new manager was detached and unwilling to address issues.  My work schedule was quite hectic and this left little time for continuing education or a personal life.  My co-workers were great, but I had limited interaction with my team mates based on the fact that I was the only Incident Manager for my shift.  The most daunting part of my job was being the only night shift Incident Manager on the shift with the highest volume of work.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working from home."
good,Great job that i love.  Sadly part of the compensation program is that when your customers go out of business they can reverse your commissions already earn and impact your income by tens of thousands of dollars.  The company then take s the equipment that they remove from the bankrupt customer and resell for nearly the same price they sold to the original customer.  Since they are suing that customer for payment they get paid on the same equipment twice while still reversing your commission.
good,"Log on the phones when you get there. Respond to telephone inquiries an complaints. Gather info, researches\resolve inquiries and logs customer calls. "
good,"Great company, lots of growth and opportunities to move anywhere with advancement potential."
good,"The Xerox location I work at is a call center for Verizon Wireless. I work in the Customer Care  department and have to assist customers with things like their bills and devices. A difficult part of the job is tying to assist and advise our customers of all of their options as well as making they understand why it is the best choice for them even if they may not know it. Yet, that is also the most  rewarding aspect of the job as well. I really enjoying talking with different  people and helping them resolve the reason why they called."
good,Working for Xerox is easy money if you are willing to BS your  way through phone calls and are not worried about customers angry with being screwed over. the atmosphere is full of happy and upbeat trainers but once on the calling floor it depends on your individual supervisors overall attitude. You are not likely to get a shift that you want without perfect attendance and they will only let you choose from preset schedules. As long as you show up and do your job it is easy money and fairly good benefits. Communication is lacking everywhere and within every department. The entire time I was there they never gave me the pay that they promised. The only reason I was let go was due to attendance and they gave me the choice to quit first so I could remain re-hireable because they liked how I did my job. It took three weeks on the calling floor to go through 3 different supervisors. Last supervisor was relaxed and amazing and was very good with feedback. Overall easy job but has a high turn over rate due to stress. Overtime is mandatory as per company decision. All other overtime is highly promoted to make up attendance and add money to your check.
good,"A Xerox com certeza é uma boa empresa para se trabalhar. Bom ambiente de trabalho, principalmente entre colegas da mesma hierarquia, boa gama de benefícios, assistência médica, odontológica, seguro de vida, PLR e previdência privada.

good,"Working at Xerox is very charming.  The management staff whom I work with we bond like we are family.  We help one another when we see each other struggling, it's real fun to be around the people I work with and manage.  The hardest part of the job is that being we are in a call center it can get a bit chaotic at times when the call volume gets high.  We try to make sure the associates are kept level headed in situations like that so that no one gets frustrated.  I love the people I work with!"

good,"Boa de se trabalhar com problemas de salários e promoções."
good,"I have worked for Xerox for a few years now and they are excellent to me most of the time. My hours there are 4am-4pm for seven straight days a week. I don't get a day off, unless we get very lucky we are given one Sunday off every two weeks. It's great money and I have learned a lot from the company. However, after their busiest three weeks maximum finally slows down, they don't offer me many more hours. I have a great work ethic and I love to work as much as I can, weekends included. My co-workers are such great people and they have helped me learn to appreciate the long days and the benefits that come with them. I have been taught responsibility, respect and how to handle and make the best of a job that can be very stressful and fast paced at times."

good,"I've worked here for about 7 years now, and its been a good company to work for, the managers and supervisors have been accomodating and work with you base on the client you are servicing. The problem is that the work load isn't consistent enough to get a full day or even week worth of hours, and since its commission based pay that you end up on, the lack of work can be devastating to your life style."
good,"inbound call center, on the phone helping customers with their concerns about their accounts."
good,"In Xerox ho sviluppato e perfezionato le mie capacità, un ottimo ambiente di lavoro formativo dove ho dato tanto e ho ricevuto altrettanto. Il problema è che, in una fase della crisi così problematica, non siamo riusciti a rimanere competitivi sul mercato con la conseguente perdita di importanti clienti. Da ciò è conseguita la cessione del nostro ramo di azienda (hybrid mail) a Selecta spa."
good,"We received calls when our clients vehicles were not in proper working order. At that point, we would locate the proper service in that area, assign them to the case, inform the driver or the company coming to do the repairs with an acceptable estimated time of arrival all within 10 minutes. Every hour we would call and check on the process of the repairs and the driver just to make sure things were going accordingly. "
good,I loved working for Sprint Tech Support Campaign at Xerox simply because it was the most challenging campaign being that you dealt with angry customers on a daily basis. The job really taught me how to empathize and understand other points of view as if they were my own. It also taught me how to de-escalate customers and fully explain a situation in a way that the customer understands what exactly is going on and that i am providing the best resolution with the systems available. It also has taught me how to maximize my finances when the pay is based on your performance and i also loved the structure of the metrics we were measured to.

Call in for service on a machine. Re-order supplies as needed. Get meter readings for end of the month billing. Punch into a electronic job ticket, information for jobs I have run. Talk to Denise, manager if I have any problems. Hardest part of my job has to be the phyical side to it, but it keeps me in shape. Most enjoyable is to be able to finish the job on time to make the teachers lives easier."
good,"In this company there was a lot to learn and employees were given the oppertunity to do so.

Each morning, I would review my MTD numbers and determine a sales goal for the day. the hardest piece of my job was trying to sell a premium product in a down economy. The relationships I built with my customers made this a bit easier. This was also the most enjoyable part of my job."

good,"Introdução do mercado de trabalho, tive oportunidade de conhecer varias áreas de trabalho."
good,"My schedule was 8-4:30 which fit perfect with my other responsibilities.This position was contractural with no benefits and there was little to no room for advancement. A typical day consists of checking emails and returning phone calls making sure to turn around print jobs by customers requested due date.I learned how to to operate various printing and bindery equipment. My coworkers were very smart dedicated employees, easy to communicate daily responsibilities to. The most enjoyable part of my job was the overall expierience. Because my responsibilities on the job shifted from day to day it made my job interesting and allowed me to learn many things."
good,This was a very fun and energetic environment everyone was willing to help and got along the flexible just wasn't in sync with my school schedule

Its call after call and the customers are very friendly and patient. The co-workers there are very understandable and nice and always liking to meet new people. I like that its so close for me and my family. The hardest part of working for Xerox, and CVS is that the calls that we get the members don't understand an we repeatedly have to repeat ourselves, but that's okay, the members are just curious and want to understand. Overall Xerox its a very good company to work for, and it pays very well."
good,This is a good stable job. I enjoy the diversity of people that works at Xerox. Laid back yet professional. Great training. The only unfortunate thing about Xerox is that payroll messes up employees paychecks more than not.

Liaising with customers and reviewing any concerns or additional tasks we could provide our customers to assist their needs. Management meetings to review progress or issues raised to a resolution.

Rewarding, time spent with my teams reviewing progression, supporting their needs and positive feedback from clients."
good,The best part about this company is that it generally allows its employees great freedom in pursuing personal projects and interests.

good,"Pretty good company!  You can look around and find plenty of complaints but come on... Things change, companies change, people get laid off, some people don’t... There is no such thing as working for a company for 30 years until retirement anymore. These are different times. Most of the complainers still believe in the old fashioned ways and can’t adjust or grow with the times.  Companies do not owe you a thing.  Show up, do the best you can, and when it’s time to go, either move on or get ticked off and turn to the internet to complain about how awful they are, blah blah blah. "
good,"Xerox was a pleasant place to work.  There were different programs an employee could be cross-trained fo  Each employee was a member of a certain team.

good,"quand on rentre chez Xerox, vous avez un contrat d'un an qui peut être renouveler 4 fois avant d'avoir un contrat permanent. ce système vous donne l'avantage de pouvoir faire vos preuves sur 1 an"
good,"Raise starting rate. The webinar based training should be at the Specialists discretion because when working alone, some people may finish quicker than others and have to sit idly by, forced to be unproductive because they have already finished their lesson. Being in a training session for 24 weeks is crucial for making every minute productive and being able to keep busy."
good,"The hardest part of this job requires you to have thick skin. You often take calls from clients that are not happy about changes in their benefits. With that being said, there is a ""teamwork"" type of environment and there are some incentives that make it worth the while."
good,"I would say working directly for the company has its benefits."
good,"El trabajo te mantiene ocupado, no hay constantes interrupciones de los superiores, pero se le paga al trabajador con un sistema de Piece Rate que no siempre es favorable por lo que algunas semanas se gana bien y otras no."

good,I was a very busy person while working for xerox. management always made sure i was taking the right courses within xerox to gain more knowledge and be able to do my job more efficiently.

good,"Fun place for work, the coordinator are very nice and helpfully"
good,"I worked in a call center. Where we processed applications for public assistance. I was there for over 6 years. I quit due to moving to another state. I found the job to be pretty easy and not overly stressful. There were some times of more stress but, mostly it was a decent place to work."

good,"Great opportunities to advance in this company."
good,Good work culture with nice management. It was always fun as well as productive working at Xerox. Allow exchanging knowledge across teams and providing opportunities to grow within the organization.
good,"It's a great place to learn.  There's always training to do.  Some training is off-limits to contract workers but if you're hired then there is lots of room for advancement.  The only real barrier, in my opinion, is becoming a full-time employee."
good,I enjoyed this job.  I managed anywhere from 50 to 73 employees.  I mentored several employess to fill my role upon my departure and to this day they are Managers.
good,It was a start up site and it had growing pains. We did have management who cared for the most part. I enjoyed working there as it was never the same issue. You could give ideas and they listened.

Working there , I have learned how to have patience and speak with people over the phone, about issues that are very upsetting to them . Also have learned ways to clam members down and handle the call as needed. The culture in the work place is very interesting , and is a fun vibe. The hardest part of the job is when you cant resolve the issue over the phone and have to call the member back. I enjoy the job the most when I am able to assist members and help them with all the issues they have ."
good,"This is a call center that takes inbound calls for the most part. People only call when they have an issue so they are already upset by the time they get to you. it's nice when you can turn it around to a positive outcome, but that doesn't happen often."

The only problem for me was my work schedule and travel."
good,"Working at Xerox was a mixed bag in that the work was incentive based, so the more productive, the more efficient you were, the better you got paid.  Coworkers were pleasant, supportive & fun, but the prospects for further advancement were not really there."

good,"It's not necessary to be a computer wizard to work this job by any means. They train their employees on all the equipment and programs needed and offer additional training if those employees don't feel comfortable at the end of it but coming in with some knowledge of how to fix computer issues really helps. Most of the problems the client has with their computers are similar, so after a few times working on those, the employee might find the job more enjoyable. The employees create a fun environment and are more than willing to help out the new people."

good,"Your average day at Xerox would include talking to people, solving problems, helping people who can't help themselves, and people who just want money. I learned so much at Xerox, I can tolerate alot of people in the real world that I couldn't before. Management is okay, Supervisors are mainly there to earn their paychecks, I've had a few good ones who actually acted like a team, but overall, my two years of being there, a lot are bad apples. You don't get much time to make friends outside of your team, you have barely any time for breaks (10 minutes), and unless you plan an event afterward, you're pretty much alone. The hardest part of my job is having to tell a customer no when I really feel they deserve something, it's all about the policy. The most enjoyable part of working at Xerox is the variety of people I get to deal with."

The management is practically left you alone if everything is running smoothly.  Maybe once in a while, they have to do their routine check up on accounts.  The hardest part of the job is customer satisfaction.  As a part of human beings, we have a diversity customers with different cultures, emotions, behaviors, and more to deal with.  They are all have to be at least satisfy if not very satisfy.  The goal is to get a very satisfy out of every customer.  The most enjoyable is knowing that your contribution help customers feel good and trusting you to do work for them.

good,My job was ever changing and developing with the company and the
good,lots of fun people to work with. very easy to get hired on. Extremely easy to move up within the company you can get promoted after as little as 1 month. once you get promoted you get really good benefits and pay. If you do not move up you get the chance to earn incentives. I know people there who have missed over 20 days in a three month period and are still employed. you do have to be nice to customers who are sometimes not very nice to you though so if you have problems with people yelling at you this is definitely not the right job. but if you do well with stress and want a laid back environment you would probably do well here

The management team at the Xerox Corporation was well suited for their individual position's. Very professional in keeping up the moral of their employees with various uplifting programs to advance, enlighten and motivate.
