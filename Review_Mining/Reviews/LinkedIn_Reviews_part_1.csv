rating,review
bad,"The company has a lot to learn from other cultures, unfortunately, for an international professional social media company, they hire only in 2 directions, there's no real diversity."
bad,"The company is a great one, management could use better training. "
bad,"My worst week was ~90 hours.  I continually put in 60-80 hours weeks and had coworkers arriving late and leaving early.  Would not recommend. The food is good but the culture is boring, like eating cardboard."
bad,Too many competing priorities. Management does not enforce any discipline. Need to develop some top - down prioritization and create standards for the work that is done across the teams.
bad,"LinkedIn has the potential to continue living up to their mission, leading with compassion, but the continuously high quarterly quotas and lack of good upper management, make it a place where you are not confident from one day to the next where you stand. "
bad,"The company was filled with ex-contractors from Apple and they treat as if you are an unwelcome entity. My manager was Asian guy who has zero respect for senior consultants like me. Your suggestions and ideas do not matter as you should do what an FTE employee tells you, even if your suggestions/ideas were to improve the quality of the product. Day in and out you were treated with disrespect. I worked in other companies like Facebook, HP etc and I was treated with respect. My manager was micro-managing me and criticizing is the only thing he excels in doing. Zero appreciation from any quarters. Good that it ended soon and I am back to where I loved to work"
bad,"Working here as sales manager. Role involves, "
bad,"Co-workers are nice, opportunities to learn new skills. Testing org overall is most hardworking set of folks in the org always meeting the demands of the business"
bad,"People used to work very hard to get things done, and collaboration was smooth. "
bad,"Culture wise Linkedin keeps its people engaged. "
bad,"Everything is fun and games until the company culture is in question. Food everyday, most are friendly however billing dept is very questionable. Not what a person would expect of this company. I was harassed badly on a daily basis. Everything from having my belongings gone through, my business and personal email watched, my car keys were copied. It was reported and nothing was done about it. They like to make fun of peoples situation (health, whether you own a home or not etc). Basically if youre not on their clique, you will be pushed out of the door."
good,"Management sucks. Good food and place to work and perks! Parking is a nightmare at some buildings. Its easy to get around if you bike or walk, and sometimes even faster."
good,"Though its known for great work/life balance and you get great benefits,great food and interact with friendly, smart co-workers, the work/life balance part does not really hold true if you have a bad manager. There is a side to this company that really needs to improve - it has really inexperienced middle level management and almost no accountability for the manager - they can pretty much do what they want and no one holds them accountable. Unfortunately, your life can be difficult at LinkedIn if you have a bad supervisor. Upper management is great though. Investigate prospective manager and team thoroughly before accepting an offer."
good,"I never felt save or stable at work, bad environment and inconsistent."
good,"Typical day starts at 6:30am where I respond and read emails. "
good,"La cohésion d'équipe, le contact clientèle, ticket resto"
good,"The culture and people you work along side really makes any task or the job at hand easier to do. There are also lots of perks like the benefits package (Health Insurance, Pension, free meals)"
good,"•	Received daily incoming packages from UPS, USPS, FedEx via scanning each item into computer to generate a log of when items came in and for who."
good,Wish I could have stayed were I was as a contractor. The management staff was excellent and gave me everything I needed for success. I loved my time working for LOS
good,Em Latam ruim - fora do Brasil muito boa - o que estraga uma empresa são as pessoas
good,Great company to work for but need to work on hiring contractors and keeping people that have really added a lot of value to the company in genera.
good,Lärorikt och spännande arbetsplats med massor av möjligheter och FOB
good,"Good tools used for the business"
good,"Best place as a workplace culture"
good,"al ser una asociación sin ánimo de lucro, el ambiente es bastante agradable y dinámico."
good,I never worked at Linked In. I don't know why they are including this on my application. I only use LinkedIn to apply for jobs and network. I'm sure it is a great place to work.
good,A lot of initiative to have every employee to grow while at LinkedIn. There isn't a whole lot of people that look like me or come from my socioeconomic background. So I spent a lot of time isolated because I didn't/couldn't relate to my team mates
good,Get the opportunity to work with really bright people but analytical teams tend to have much longer working hours. Otherwise the benefits are great and you will definitely learn a lot.
good,"LinkedIn has the standard tech culture that defies traditional, conservative professional culture.  No dress code. Employees skateboard, play around, etc in the middle of the work day.  There's food everywhere, etc.  I didn't have that positive of an experience because I didn't fit into the culture well.  It was too much fun (never thought I would say this).  Also it wasn't diverse.  They claim they want you to bring your full self to work; however, they more so want you to bring their interpretation of what your full self should be to work."
good,"You can be the top performer in all areas and get a rating of ""exceeds expectations"" at each review, and still get laid off.  They tout their ""culture and values"" but do not really exercise them."
good,Link takes the security of their clients very serpious. This company is also willing to train those who have no previous  experience and have a flexible schedule.
good,I developed many KPI dashboard for all product lines and worked a lot on management reporting. I also worked on many valuation cases.
good,I learnt a lot working on some cutting edge technologies! I enjoyed working there.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, comedor subsidiado, cerca paradas de buses y tren"
good,"Pros: Open culture, management is open for change. Small start type culture, hence an open door policy. Managers sit on the same floor."
good,"Worked there for almost 5 years. The stressful job and heavy travel is mostly in the account/relationship management space. The offices are great. Benefits are the best you'll find anywhere and make up for the lower salary in terms of market value. Leadership was great but that was prior to MS acquisition. CEO awesome. Work/life balance was just ok - If you need to work remote, there is not a lot of flex on this, they want you in the office for collaboration. As long as you don't mind going to office, I would recommend. I didn't care about free lunches, game room, etc. I needed more flex for family which I think is a bit of a miss here."
good,"Saw terrific opportunity early in my tenure but then it got incredibly competitive, cut throat and political as the company grew quite large. That's really the gist of it."
good,"But culture is shifting to number only business"
good,"Great people though platform is not up to date yet. Management OK, though not able to cope with the growth and need different style in helping for a growth focus"
good,LinkedIn has been a steady place to work for the past many years.  It's lost the startup culture with everyone pitching in to get things done.  Now it's more like any other publisher.  Advancement in technical roles can be somewhat stagnant as management still doesn't know how to look at value unless you're bringing in money.
good,Great culture which makes the day to day a lot of fun.  Company is going through a transition from hyper growth to stable growth and is trying to find its identity as it goes from disruptor to incumbent
good,"Pros: People super invested in the company and their jobs, transparency, unlimited time off, free food, understanding managers."
good,"A typical day at LinkedIn starts with going to office and spending time in completing various sprint tasks. Company really take good care of employees and have provided all the facilities in office like free food, gym, yoga classes etc but I never got time to utilize the benefits. I had to attend late night meetings daily after coming from office with US team and this is required if you want to get your tasks completed as there is lot of dependency on some teams based out of US. So, I hardly use to get time to spend with family and I always use to feel like I am at work doesn't matter I am at office or home."
good,"They're a good company to work for.  They tell you they'll transform you and they do. You'll certainly not be the same person that joined.  There's a lot of opportunities to grow and stretch yourself, as you'll be working in a challenging environment where the demand is high."
good,"High tech, Good place to work"
good,"I have learned a huge amount at LinkedIn from many exceptionally smart leaders and colleagues, and have had the chance to take advantage of many opportunities, including an international transfer, which is demonstrative of the emphasis the company puts on ""transformation"" as a key value. A healthy work/life balance is encouraged, but is not always realistic, especially in some smaller teams working across multiple regions."
good,A good place to work with all cooperative staff and management. staff can work according to the level of students. Only the salary pakages are very low
good,"Empresa  onde eu aprendi leadership / leverage  e onde eu ganhei muitos treinamentos."
good,"Co-workers are outstanding-folks really want to see you succeed. People work hard but do so voluntarily. Very positive environment, you feel like an owner and have the ability to make an impact."
good,"You work a lot, but they have great benefits, its a great brand,"
good,"Free meals, bikes, gyms and gym reimbursement. The wrong people get promoted time after time and poor decision making on the promotions make it hard to keep working here."
good,"I'm looking for another job in another country than Iran I prefer Deutschland, England,Canada , Norway, Denmark, Sweden,USA or Australia because these mentioned countries are more advanced and more satisfying also they have potential for improvement"
good,Buena pagina responsable y exelene ambiente con su pagina alboral
good,Gestion de la clientèle est un véritable plaisir surtout sur les réseaux sociaux. Il faut toujours innover pour toucher le plus de personnes possible.
good,"Waking up at an odd hour, maybe after not sleeping for more than 2 hours sometimes, was the most challenging aspect of my job. But the reward was that I would then meet new people, learn something new about their culture and discover a new city. The challenges sometimes were language and culture barriers as not all of us came from the same country or spoke the same language- colleagues or passengers. Being able to overcome those barriers and sometimes rude passengers, taught me patience and understanding along with humility. Having had to work odd hours taught me to take better care of my health, both mental and physical- it taught me to lead a more fit life-style. Multi tasking and a positive approach was what I gained from this adventurous experience."
good,"working in a fun environment."
good,"Mi trabajo consistió en la creación de una imagen y nombre de una nueva empresa, además de darles visibilidad en el campo exterior."
good,"Excellent benefits and some great people to work with; lack of career growth due to poor management; constant turn over results in a repetitive and uninspired culture, but the benefits (gym, free breakfast and lunch, unlimited time off) help to make up for downfalls in management"
good,LinkedIn has a great culture and benefits. A lot of smart people work here and I have enjoyed my time here. I would definitely recommend LinkedIn to my colleagues.
good,"The company was a great place to work for. Unfortunately, the division I was in (Sales Systems) was not a good fit."
good,Company as whole is great to be apart of. The culture is one that is considerate and nurturing to their employees. They are a company that really focuses on their employees and their ability to maintain that is incredible.
good,"Great place to work. Although some managers are not as good as others depends what team you're in."
good,Meeting metric gets onto you. Over a period work becomes monotonous. Frequent management changes makes it difficult to adapt & keep up your pace & mental attitude.
good,"I do not wish to publicly review Linkedin.  This is not my style, if anyone has questions about the org or my time there please reach out to me directly."
good,"I was a part of incredible change in the recruitment and advertising landscape, really appreciated the opportunity to do so for almost 6 years. I feel like the sr executive leadership has a fantastic vision and mission."
good,Very good company with nice culture and tons of cool benefits. Lot of career opportunities and very competitive. Leadership exactly knows what they are doing.
good,"Great place to work and highly collaborative."
good,"LinkedIn offers high pay and state of the art tools, but the culture is competitive.  I would recommend for people who are polished, but not for people who are insecure."
good,It is very busy office but a relaxing environment helps to maintain a good balance. We have  friendly team members who all help each other when needed.
good,"good perks, decent salary, good work life balance. The brand has a lot of value and its nice being a part of a large tech silicon valley based org."
good,Linkedin culture is very positive and cordial. Everyone is very helpful in creating a stress free enviroment. It is a joy to come to work
good,Thoroughly enjoyed learning the internet industry. The company works hard to attract top talent.
good,Led a community of student group and motivated them to become active on LinkedIn. It was an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. I learned a great about leading and delegating tasks and getting students to become active on the platform.
good,I work as a Data Engineer consultant at LinkedIn. It is a good place with work life balance. The food at linkedin is great. The location is quite good
good,"Its true what they say about tech companies. You work hard, play hard, and burn out at the end after a few short years as everything you do there is geared to get the maximum out of you any way the company can. Most people are under 30, and green around the gills. Management can be very immature, and does not readily practice what it champions - diversity, inclusion, and belonging. The culture is a bit cultish and elitist. But if you an work with that and see past it, there are great perks and benefits to working here. Not just in terms of gym, catered meals, wellness allowances etc, but in the collaboration that is evident among colleagues. Not once was I ever spoken to in a way I didn't deem appropriate or disrespected by my bosses - not in the way I have seen since. Lots of support, encouragement, and the learning resources are top-notch. Perfect if you want to use the opportunity to gain credibility in your career very quickly. Use it as a stepping stone to better things."
good,Pocas oportunidades de desarrollo o crecimiento por ser del sector público.
good,"Worked on different interesting research project. Opportunity for publishing papers and filing patents. Includes facilities like gym, cafeteria, table tennis."
good,fun and learning environment. long working hours. provides good benefits also decent pay. builds work ethic and requires devotion to the job. best thing is the travel
good,Fast passed and you learn a lot. It is the tech industry so you never know how long your department will survive. Not a very diverse work environment but a very fun environment.
good,"Great location, perks, good people! Linkedin provides an atmosphere that allows you to stay on point and be productive. They provide excellent meals, snacks, and healthy treats!"
good,"Great Job, especially for entry level people. Downfall was the outsourcing. If you do a contracted job, be there to work hard and try to have some fun while doing so."
good,A empresa tem uma boa remuneração mas tem um grande problema com reconhecer os funcionarios.

good,"LiknedIn provided a great opportunity to grow as an account manager and sales professional, as well as great clients to help grow their businesses - I would recommend the role!"
good,"Every one of the employees at LinkedIn is pulled by a healthy wave, i.e. ""Relationship matters"". They value the integrity of the organisation and strive to uphold the slogan of ""customer comes first"". It was a great learning time at LinkedIn. Employees are compensated and complimented well. "
good,"Great company to work for. Surrounded by innovative people.  You must work hard to get where you want to go. Best food in town, wonderful barista, and great snacks."
good,"I started working for LinkedIn about 15 months ago.  My onboarding wasn't as thorough as I would have liked."
good,"Was a really fun place to work, great people, however Sydney is more of an outpost office to difficult to advance.  There was a lot of travel, however my team was like a family to me."
good,"Linkedin is a fun place to work at. It has a table tennis table, Pool, foosball table, a cricket pitch and lots more. The company really takes care of its employees."
good,"Every day was a learning experience.  That's what I loved most about my career.  I am a very good manager of people and look forward to helping each employee grow and improve every day.  I consider co-workers as family.  The hardest part of the job is letting someone go/firing someone.  The most enjoyable part of the job is completing each day safely, productively and with a short term and long term plan that the team has communicated."
good,LinkedIn embraces the culture what most tech companies in California have.  The work hard - play hard mentality.
good,"All and all LinkedIn is a very educational and fun environment to work at."

good,"Great Company but should look to hire experienced managers. Very good culture. Good job security. Good food, and great facilities all over. The only issue would be management"
good,A great work environment with a college campus feel to it. Great location in downtown San Francisco and close to transit stops. Great work place culture with opportunities to excel. hardest part of the job was being a contractor placed there via another company that I worked full time for. (HCL America Inc.)
good,Became a campus editor and got a lot of resources and support. LinkedIn seems like a place that wants to invest in early career. Can't say much else as I was not employed as a full time employee.
good,LinkedIn is going through many changes these days. Great opportunity to grow in your career and fantastic value we deliver to our customers every day.
good,"According to my experience, working in Thinc Studio Pvt. is fun, a person can learn a lot of things not according to his job but also the things that matter in daily life, But the salary package is not good, a person can't afford his own expenses."
good,It is a good company to work. the management is very cooperative and flexible towards the  employee.culture is good.learning new things is hardest part of the job.
good,"All the processes at LinkedIn were really well thought through, so I experienced zero barriers to doing the best work of my life. I think toward the end of my time there, there was concern about the lack of quickness in my work, which is a shame, because things should be more about quality than about quantity. They were pressuring me to work 10-hour days, and I had a 2-hour commute. But it is a business after all."
good,"Continuously striving to improve the products and services they provide to a changing workforce, which takes talent and courage. The drive to be at the cutting edge is apparent within the culture there."
good,"Great company, executive leadership is top notch. There is a lot of high growth marketing programs with interesting work. Past few years there's been several additional layers of management and team expansion. Company is definitely shifting into a large corporate environment."

good,"Good Hands on Experience ,Lots of Responsibilities, Varieties of Projects."
good,"I was a contract employee for LinkedIn.  Learning what a internet company and culture is like was eye-opening and I'm happy I did it.  The environment is extremely quiet, because everyone is on a computer.  The work was all email queue, so not exciting or rewarding.  But the culture was fun, young and helpful.It was truly the most beautiful and ergonomically designed place I have ever worked.  It has to be because the work is dull. Everyone seems to like it there and that alone says a lot for a company.  They are doing lots of things right!"
good,"A great place to work. Always learning something new. Long hours and well rewarded. Management is approachable, everyone is easy going and great to work with."

good,"A great place to work, with strong values, commitment to perform."
good,From the mission to the lunch everything LinkedIn I have nothing but great things to say.  It's interesting that LinkedIn holds itself accountable to the caliber of offices/benefits in an area versus holding itself to it's own LinkedIn standard and that may be my only slight criticism.
good,"Great place to work and network with colleagues/professionals. The food is amazing and they provide outstanding benefits, from: paid gym membership, paid transportation, and health coverage."

good,"Working for LI was an amazing experience. Apart from having an incredibly supportive and open-minded manager, my colleagues and the environment we worked in allowed me to grow, both as an individual and a professional. I could be myself in every scenario, without worrying on being judged. I could share ideas and brainstorm with other members of my team in complete ease."

good,Linkedin really treats its employees amazingly well.  Every possible benefit I've ever had or heard of was provided.  They work hard to keep employees happy.
good,"I was fortunate to be part of this wonderful company, whose business actually helps improve the lives of people around the world. As a Systems Engineer Intern at LinkedIn, I was part of Compute Engineering team. I had the chance to learn and understand how LinkedIn operates with its Data Centers around the world. I had a wonderful mentor who would help me understand my job well. I also had a visionary manager whose intentions actually inspired me to work more passionately. My typical day would include, writing python scripts for an application development, weekly meetings with mentor or manager or the entire team. The encouragement I received, never made me think I had a hard job and I enjoyed every part of my time as an intern here. One thing that LinkedIn taught me is that to build strong relationships."

good,"A typical day at work involved interacting with Sales team, engineering and resolving client queries over e-mail or outbound calls. The company gave us the liberty to be transparent with customers and telling them things as is. The across function co-workers were good, positive and helpful. Immediate management were good till it was being managed out of Dublin and Singapore, a wrong choice of manager for India, split the team. Overall work experience has been wonderful."
