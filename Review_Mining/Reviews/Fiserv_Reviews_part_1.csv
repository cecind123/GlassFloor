rating,review
bad,"Lots of changes had been done & lots are pending to implement yet."
bad,Fiserv/First Data is not a good place to work. Management will not a decision and no one know what is going on. No clear future or direction for the company.
bad,"I tried to get accommodations for my medical issues and was not helped, even with a doctor’s note. When asking for assistance to advance, all I received was a big run around."
bad,"Fiserv took over First Data and immediately cut down benefits, no saving sick time, no banking holidays, terrible health and dental, charging $140/month if you smoke, mandatory testing to make sure you don't lie about smoking, if you do they cut your health coverage. Also made non-smoking campus, but don't discourage obesity which drives up health costs. Website is terribly set up. Facial recognition for time clock is a pain. They don't like to answer questions but instead refer you to website, again it's terrible. This is a new transition and I already see a lot of people that want out. I don't see competitive wages or representation of departments as a priority, only big boss bonuses. If you enjoy being dumped on and treated as a faceless number you might like it."
bad,"I worked there two years and if you enjoy getting cursed at over the phone for 8 hrs a day then this is the perfect job for you, the pay was substandard too,"
bad,The only people that haven't quit are mentally challenged or thier first language wasn't English! This is a company where you will never grow. RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN!
bad,Managers don’t take calls unless they absolutely HAVE to. It really makes you wonder what their jobs are cause they kinda just dance around the office
bad,"worst place to work. Management was a joke. The supervisors did nothing all day but take 2 hour lunches and sit on their cell phones the rest of the day. Managers were the worst, did nothing at all. The only advancement was in another desk when the one you set at was being used for food storage."
bad,"too much stress, they change the rules to benefit them as leadership and as a company, you are never in the right you as a rep are always wrong, and there is nothing they will do for you to make it a great place for you to work, they wait till you are settled in to unload all the bad things about the job and they don't ask if you want to take on new roles or responsibilities, they just make you do things. unfair to everyone, turn around in the building is high because leadership lies too much to the reps."
bad,"The training is not good, this a Revolving door type of company I have been here almost a year  in they have let some many employees go. They keep having all these new hires classes but no stays."
bad,"Never work here. Between the training department and the operations department, there was no communication, both sides constantly blamed the other. There was one amazing manager, but he left for his own sanity, and I quickly followed as his replacement was a walking, talking HR disaster."
bad,People come and go at the drop of a dime. No real in-depth training. You were expected to so much with only knowing very little about the job and the clients.
bad,"For an advanced technological company, they were extremely behind in equipment. "
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone, very bad training, outdated systems and 1970’s phones being used. Everything that was promised never happened and they never gave me my last check"
bad,"After working for Fiserv as a contractor, I can personally say that they treat the contractors differently as opposed to those they hire through their own means.  Their card services supervisors have no clue how to coach up agents, opting to tell them to fix what the agent is doing wrong themselves or they can be let go."
bad,"Workplace culture - meetings routinely cancelled/rescheduled, management regularly walks out of meetings to take calls, personal and work. Team meetings everyone is to busy doing their work to actually pay attention to the topic/point of the meeting. Very little collaboration, the right hand has absolutely no clue what the left hand is doing.  Had been working for my company for over 18 years, never had a bad review in fact the theme had been ""sorry we could not give you more money"" for the last 5 years or so.  Sign in for work on the first of a month and have an email very late the night before from my boss's boss for a meeting at 11:00.  They let me go, after 18 years no warning no reasoning.  You are no longer employed here, maxed out for severance, will be in contact via mail. Get a message a week later from my boss, who was on vacation, apologizing for how that went down and how I deserved more money."
bad,Horrible place to work! wouldn't recommend anyone to work here! And they are racist. I've worked for Fiserv for two years and they treated me like cra
bad,"Don’t work here. They don’t care about you unless you’re their “favorite” I use to love working here until the end of last year. It all went down hill. The drama is absolutely AWFUL, management lies, are rude, disrespectful and half the time they don’t even help and will sit there and talk bad about their workers to each other. The customers have got so much worse. They’re very verbally abusive & they don’t want to take fault for something that they did for Bill Pay being self serve only but the bank doesn’t want to do anything about it. You get burned out after awhile. They will mess up your paychecks then blame it on you, sometimes refused to fix it. This job is very stressful. I could go on and on and on about this job. If you care about your sanity, don’t work here because it will be ruined."
bad,"Worst job environment I have ever encountered.  Temporary employees treated poorly, yelled at, ignored, and blamed for process problems that were not under their control."
bad,"management like to string you along"
bad,"Internally, Fiserv is a MESS. "
bad,don't trust this place they will lie straight to your face and fire you in a heart beat  they don't train you good. they don't support you once you get out of training. they let you fail. they love to write you up. and they never work with you even if someone like your mother or father is dying
bad,The Client Tech Department makes life unbearable at Fiserv. This whole department needs new management starting from the Portland Office. Micro management HEL*!
bad,"I have learned a lot working in this environment, however, there is poor management for the work flow. On a daily basis we are in need of help in some areas. Overall the job is not complicated just a little demanding depending on the work flow and the day of the week. The position gives me knowledge on how to handle customer/clients request, working closely with Client Services to meet the needs of the clients, also team work is very important as well. This job can help you further your experience in many areas in  the work force."
bad,Would not recommend working there.  Constant change and fire drills.  Good managers have left due to poor senior leadership.  Disorganized and poor systems to work out of.
bad,"This is a typical ""boiler room"" atmosphere, with outdated computers and monitors. The place is run down and dirty, and the trainers and managers are rude and self serving. They treat you with a condescending approach, and the trainers have a ""militia"" type mentality, and if you step out of line, they fire you! ...now, you may think I'm a disgruntled ex-employee, and you're right, i am!! ...however,  the truth is the truth, no matter how you slice it. Maybe i expected more from a company with a somewhat well-known name, but i was very wrong, they way they do business, at least through their employees, leaves MUCH to be desired!"
bad,"This job is hands down the worst job I have ever had. The stress that you have to put up with is ridiculous and management does not care. The one good thing about our job was the PTO, but recently they have even taken that away. They said that it was going to ""benefit"" us. So, we were given 18days PTO, but now instead we are given 11PTO and the rest is sick days. So, the company was TOO CHEAP to give us our 18 days and then additional sick/personal days like most jobs do. I have experience high blood pressure since working here and more headaches then ever. This place like another reviewer stated is just a revolving door. This place does not care about the quality of the calls, but the quantity. This company gives zero cares about their employees. The metrics that are incorporated are unrealistic. The surveys are just unfair. You cannot control what the client will say on the survey, when you do all that you can on the call, but you are the one that gets pointed for it. Just an awful company to work for! Consider looking else where, trust me."
bad,"*managers bend rules for there personal benefit-breaking company policy regularly "
bad,"not good didnt like it there recently "
bad,Management wasn't very personable. They allowed no time off for the first 90 days without you getting terminated. The workload was heavy with very little help.
bad,"Procedures are outdated. No training provided to staff. Pay is very low compared to what they ask you to do. They hire too many temp employees that do not care about the company and/or servicing the client an/or customers. "
bad,No Management on hand for current department not properly trained when needed to take off for medical purposes had bo one to speak with no one had an answer
bad,"My coworkers and I have literally been employed with this company for two weeks through a staffing agency. The first week was training the second week nothing was very unorganized nothing was planned out all we did was sit at our cubicles all week and socialized with one another. Fiserv had nothing to do for us concerning training yet yesterday quite a handful of us was let go with no explanation, all they could tell our recruiters was that we didn’t meet the metrics but in order to build metrics you have to be on the phones first. Everything about this company is unprofessional, unorganized, and inconsiderate. We did absolutely nothing but was taken away from our jobs literally a week and a half before Christmas. I would not recommend this place to anyone at all!"
bad,"the mangement are horrible people."
bad,I was a Fiserv for 7 years and it was fine.  After a management change my work began to suffer as well as my health.  The banking industry is a very exacting business.  I was sorry to leave but needed a change of pace.
bad,I don’t like fierv they are very different to much on the phones the communication is very off there people only think of them self’s ppl are not treated fairly
bad,unorganized and no communication with employees. No advancement and family is hired in better positions. Overtime is at a drop and no for warning to help employees
bad,When executive management doesn't meet their numbers they cut employees so they can meet their year end numbers to get their bonuses.  This is a very bad place to work.
bad,"Even when you did things right, they will never appreciated and they would come up with the different things every day to blame you for things that you didn't know you were supposed to do lack of training that a lack of communication was a major factor and they would never let you go above the career path that you deserve"
bad,"Managers do not have your back at all. "
bad,"The culture was not what they sold it to me as. I was told they value work life balance. 1 month in our VP got upset because he was there late every day, but we were not all still sitting there."
bad,"Challenging and interesting opportunity, but supervisor was very unprofessional. Constant pestering to go to lunch, hang out, etc. This behavior has apparently gone on for years, but is overlooked by management. Sad."
bad,i was treated unfairly and would not work there again. i loved my job and the people but ended up being backstabbed and didnt appreciate the way things ended there.
bad,Not a very nice place to work. I wondered why they were always hiring. Management is very poor. Equality doesn't exist. Do not apply at Fiserv. No stability.
bad,"Fiserv is fine for new associates, but if you have been there several years, the workload increases, but the pay doesn't. They do not keep up with the market in training, nor pay. Their layoffs are industry known and they are proud of them."
bad,I could go on and on but this is a horrible place to work. The ETG division is chaotic and an abusive environment. Don't do it to yourself. Your health would be at stake working here.
bad,Too many changes due to business restructuring. Workplace culture is not exciting. Sometimes expected to work longer hours. Team I worked with was great. Management is okay.
bad,You're just another number at Fiserv.  They do not care about your well-being.  Everyone is expendable and replaceable.  Fiserv is only concerned about the stock price and does NOT care about their clients or associates.
bad,"Senior Management is awful. Always have a scapegoat in place for when (expletive) hits the fan."
bad,Everyone you meet or talk to wish things would change for the better.  The management team never have a kind word as to you doing a good job.  We were just given a raise and they've taken our bonus and 12 hr days away.  For some of us we still have to work the 12 hrs in order to receive the pay!  Employees were quitting because of the pay and the 12 hours.  Not a cool place to work for unless you are made of brick.  The moral at this company is terrible because of the management team.
bad,"If you want a job where you're guaranteed to go absolutely nowhere then come here. The pay isn't good, the hours vary, the management sucks, and their machines hardly work."
bad,"This was a place that was to help seniors, instead this place lined the pockets of the management.  Too bad they didn't follow their golden rule and stick to what they set out to do.  It was a good place a long time ago."
bad,"Would never work for Fiserv again. Worse management, bad culture, no processes or procedures, everything is done on the fly. No job security, horrible place to work."
bad,"Middle management is constantly playing dirty politics to get bonuses by high employee turnover. Salaries below market and no scope for raises or bonuses for normal workers as only management is eligible for these incentives."
bad,"You can not have a life working for this company."
bad,horrible company to work for. they don't care about their employees and they don't care about anything else other than money
bad,"This company is not longer in business.  I spent time developing relationships with notaries, mortgage companies and lenders."
bad,"All employees are overworked because the company is under staffed.  no home/work life balance, you are forced to make the job your life, no organizational structure, job responsibilities are not clearly defined."
bad,"I caught a preview of a job posting that fiserv cares about it's employees and has good managers. Bunk !  Do not believe it. First off why would they have to point this out if it was already true. I assure it is ""Not"". The management I was forced to endure would say and do anything to protect their self interests and I will guarantee you it is not in the best interest of an employee. They will on purpose tear you apart and set you up to end your career. Who wants a so called good manager who's intellect consists of ""You are going to do what we tell you""."
bad,"The jobs was stressful, as they wanted all employees cross trained in several other positions and sometimes without notice you were switched to a different platform to work.  That is stressful and requires quickly changing gears.  Supervisors look the other way, and are definitely not people friendly and you must watch your back.  Read your annual reviews carefully because they will write false claims about you as an employee.  Human Resource Dept not helpful with any issues you may have, and are more than likely to back management and not the employee, so be careful there.  Long term employees who had worked 10 years or more began to leave, and management didn't seem to care nor ask why they would want to leave.  You are paid adequately, but raises are few and far between.  1-2% is normal, and some years none at all.  Fiserv constantly brings in new business and expects already overburdened employees to keep up and do more and more work each day, and pretty soon, more employees seem to be leaving faster than they can  hire new ones.  Only a good job temporarily."
bad,"Terrible hours"
bad,"Despite being a call center that is very productive, the amount of micro managing that is done with the employees makes most people want to quit."
bad,"Inbound call center in which customer call to make credit card payments, fast pace environment however when it is slow they do offer the opportunity to leave early. Management is very good always asking if you need anything and are always available when needed. As well as Co-Workers they offer an instant messenger in which you can chat with the whole floor if you have a question or with a specific co-worker. It is always a different situation and rewarding to assist your customer making there payments."
bad,"Was in charge of AS/400's and System 36 systems for Service Bureau and inhouse Credit Union Software.  Systems & Application Programmer in RPG III and IV."
bad,"Positive reviews must be that of out of touch management that micro-manage or (if you notice) ""previous"" employees. Health benefits continue to get worse. Management explanation ""that is the way the industry is going"". Resources (such as documentation to do your job) non-existent. We are told repeatedly that we won't get them, but are expected to know our job with no training. Also asked repeatedly by management (due to low moral and employee surveys) what they can do to improve and most (95%+) ideas are struck down. Oh, but we can wear jeans to work"
bad,was fired after 39.8 years absolutely ridiculous culture has gone way downhill over the last 3.5 years
bad,"This company is large, with many umbrellas. It is difficult to keep up with changes and it affects communication. Unfortunately, clients are impacted as well. "
bad,"The only positive thing that I can say about Fiserv is that their insurance benefits begin the first day of employment, however, the healthcare is really expensive. At the Indianapolis plant, there is a lot of favoritism between supervisors and employees. Employees were dating their supervisors and no one even batted an eye. Fiserv leaves no room for a home life. They had us on mandatory overtime for 4-5 months. I don't believe that Fiserv is built to have lasting employees mainly because of their point system. After 30 points, they will fire you. 30 may seem like a lot, but if you call off, you get 5 points, and if you call off during peak period, you get 6. Even if you are one minute late clocking in, you get 1 point. If you leave early from your shift for any reason that isn't covered by FMLA, you still get a point. The employee morale is extremely low and the only thing that the higher-ups do is ""treat"" us by passing out vending machine candy. Unless Fiserv makes a change, I would never recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"This place plays favorites and does not care about how much experience you have or what you have actually done for the company. It all depends on who you know and if you are willing to do as told, no questions asked. They have no benefits for tenured associates and their turn-over rate is very high. Would not recommend this place for anyone."
bad,If you want to work at a company that rewards for your work instead  of who are favored by Sr Management. Forget about this company. This is lead by a boys club mentality if you are part of it fine. If not you get targeted until you are forced out. This company has the worst unethical Management and HR supports it.
bad,Responsible for daily reports on disbursement of provider checks; prepare 1099-MISC forms and W-9 for year-end processing; manually sort void/stop checks to be returned to the customer along with month-end reports and other office related duties
bad,They will hire in people at a higher rate and treat their seasoned employees like manure. We don't work just to work.
bad,Only if you need a job. Increase communication with associates. Anyone can talk the talk but walk the walk is what is lacking. Every employee no matter where will say increase their salary but it is especially true here due to the low staffing and high amount of work.
bad,"Culture is terrible!"
bad,"Typical day @ fiserv was nothing but chaos and drama. Management ha!! there was none. I worked in the Omaha location for 5 1/2yrs, and I have seen 1 region manager,3 center managers,5supervisors come and go. There is not training, leadership, employee loyalty from this company. The center didnt print its first training manual until 2013!! to top that only 13 people got a training manual. Management is only there to cover there jobs and to fire anybody that put there job in jeopardy."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this company for anyone to work at. Bad management, no structure, no morals and values."
bad,"Fiserv as company is very lacking. I would not recomend any one to seek employment with this company. Fiserv operates as a sweet shop. When they ask if you like overtime they do not tell you that you will be working six days a week. Your pay will start at 10.50 for produciton. You will be treated as a a dollar sign for the upper managment. The staff are very negative as are the managment, due to the treatment they are given from the company. The staff endure extreme pressure at all levels. Many of the assocates are seeking employment elsewhere due the the horid work conditions."
bad,"For those that say fiserv is a good place to work for, are liars. Y'all probably making more money then most people. The pay, benefits and mangement sucks big time. The ceo find ways to save the company money by cutting staff and stop contributing to the 401k just to name a few and get a 10 million dollar bonus, while most of us are living paycheck to paycheck"
bad,There is not job advancement. Mangers will tell you to your face that the rule that they are putting into place only apply to employees and not themselves. So they do not lead by example. Executive management does not care about employee moral or giving incentives to promote the company. In 2012 the CEO received a 18.1 percent pay increase and the employees either got nothing or as little as 3%. But yet Fiserv says that they are not making budget. People are uptight always on edge. Do not work for Fiserv this is speaking as a current employee. And yes I am looking for another job.
bad,"When you first start they make everything seem great, like there is no better place in the world to work. Once you get through training you start to see all of the a** you have to kiss to even be looked at. The human resources department is a joke in itself, and the people in there should lose there jobs just for being incompetent. The management is ridiculous, there's probably the same turn over rate for management as there is agents ( which is not good.) When I first started there I used to recommend anyone needing a job to apply there because of how ""great"" it was, now there is nothing good to say. It is all fake and a show they put on. If anything take the job for the free pay in training and that's it. They use the high unemployment rate to lure people in because they know how bad people need jobs."
bad,At time it was good to work for with the clients and all. Also the most of the people were good to work with.
bad,Started at the company thinking that I would make a difference with the networking skills I have. That was a mistake. Always had supervisor getting on me for one thing or another for things being overblown. And I know I wasnt the only getting this kind of backlash in my department. They need big changes in management.
bad,"In the beginning I geniunely liked working for the company but then my niceness was taken for granted and their true colors began to show.Heavy work loads with a ridiculious amount of side projects from other departments not including special projects given by supervisiors with not enough time to complete the projects let alone your own work several employs can vouch for all details in this review. The scale for bonuses and raises are so outrageous and so hard for even the best of the best to receive even the smallest raise or bonus. Dont mention pto and sick days heaven forbid you become ill or hospitalized that is another horrible topic countless fellow employees encountered, they almost lost their jobs because there are no exceptions for people injured if you are breathing even faintly you are expected to make it in. I was with the company for several years with no raise,and seen no room for growth. This company has a lack of appreciation for those that devote their time and effort to helping improve the work load of the team . I wish that there was more nice that i could say but unfortunately this company has left me with none and has sucked countless years of my life out of me."
bad,The management was not connected with their agents needs. If you had a bad customer on the phone who did nothing but cuss you and talked bad to you they would not take the calls and blamed you for it
bad,"Fiserv is not a bad company just do not ever apply for client services debit team. The management on site gossips about employees, the culture would be better if upper management listened, if they cared about their employees like they care about the clients, your voice is not heard if you try to voice the diversity. Always short staffed because good employees are leaving."
bad,"dishonest supervisors"
bad,"Don’t work here. They lure candidates in with higher pay than others in the field, but don’t expect any substantial raises unless you’re promoted - which you have to apply for. Then, you should be grateful for whatever they give you and never ever ask for more otherwise you’re not a team player. You need to do supervisor level work, putting in extra hours without exploiting overtime,  but know that a promotion is not in the cards because “hey, that’s just the corporate game.”"
bad,You will constantly deal with angry customers with this company. 99% of the people who call are mad about their cards not working or for the long wait for someone to answer the phone. The systems are outdated and management is aware of it yet they have came up with no solution to resolve it. Management does not care about their employees everybody who works there is just a number. When you try to schedule time off months in advanced the days are already blacked out before you could even try to plan a vacation. They also do shift bids every six months so you’re schedule will never be the same.  I worked there for the check and left as soon as I found something better. This is the worst job I ever had honestly.
bad,would not suggest anyone working there as a temp.  they treat temps like they are worth nothing. they are not accommodating to personal  needs. the jobs itself was not bad
bad,"retention and development are biggest areas that need help at Fiserv, lots of contracted employees with little to no ambition management does not train leaders for position they are in."
bad,"Industry is shrinking and not managing it well.  Management is a joke, company meetings consist of the executive team patting each other on the back, with a slide or two about missing goals but gloss over that.  Great job ""sales guy"" but in reality we haven't hit a goal in 36 months.  Middle management is no better, they are all smart people, don't get me wrong, but because you excel in a position does not mean you can manage a team of people, but that is how the promoting works.  Anyone that has left has not been replaced unless the position is absolutely critical."
bad,"Just don't work here.  You're considered property.  Pure and simple.  If you don't have the degrees you won't advance.  Also if you use tuition assistance, and quit, they have the right to take it from your bank account, which can put you in the negative.  I've seen it happen."
bad,"First of all the 2nd shift work hours that they say are 330p-12a, I can’t tell you the last time we worked those hours. I’ve been there almost 10 years and our schedule most of the time is 330p-4a Monday-Friday and we DO WORK EVERY SATURDAY 130p-10p. Raises every year have only been 2%, if you even get one. Lack of communication between management is completely ridiculous and favoritism is out of control. Horrible place to work. BUT as far as the job it is super easy and I enjoy it it’s just management and wages and the hours that are common complaints and issues."
bad,Projects are not managed well. Management needs to develop better form of communication for employees can better manage their tasks. Management had expectations that were not communicated until after the task comes due.
bad,A typical day at work was a miserable grind of what seemed to be unending monotony where you are constantly stressed because a single bad phone could jeopardize your career while also dealing with irate and often angry cardholders because their cards are not working. The day I left was perhaps the most stress relieving moment of my 3-year tenure there. Unless you are absolutely desperate for work do not work for this company because the turnover rate is insane there for a reason.
bad,The trainer and management team were horrible and completely clueless. Basic questions asked were unanswered. The training was unorganized.  I was a victim of bait and switch..meaning I applied and interviewed for one position however the company had me training for a totally different department.
bad,"Though it is fun to work here, managers and leads are big time dumb(as* h**rs).  You may get a bunch of food people as your team mates, but internal politics is too much. Salary wise all they will never keep their promise."
bad,"I do not recommend Fiserv if you are expecting job security. The direction from immediate managers and team members are ambiguous and subjective. Senior employees hoard information and do not give necessary information to breed success of the team. It is a competitive environment where people are afraid or do not desire to share historical knowledge that would potentially help current project and newer coworkers. It is hard to work in that type of environment, unless you like any of the above."
bad,"This is not the Fiserv financial company--it is output solutions, the print shop."
bad,"Extremely lacking on written procedures and guidelines. Co-workers are great but management expects miracles and holds you responsible downstream if you don't produce them. Unrealistic goals relative to financial planning. Sales department reports unrealistic financial expectations for future revenue, sometimes by a factor of 3 or 4, and then you must explain why production doesn't realize their projections. Management over commits production's abilities and then must pick and choose whose turnaround will not make contractual requirements and you must explain that to the unlucky clients."
bad,"Avoid working here."
bad,"Miserable place to work.  Co-workers were great, management and HR were a joke.  No chance for advancement what so ever unless you did some massive kissing"
bad,"Difficult Management to work for as they didn't understand the concept of ""truth'"
bad,"The leadership team created a hostile work environment for valued associates who were meeting the expectations and following through with the departments Mission Statement.  The VP's failed to communicate their vision to the greater team for which the AOM's were assigned."
bad,"A typical day at work is dealing with people that have been promoted out of incompetence, or through cronyism. There is absolutely no advancement opportunities for anyone unless you know someone. And, no opportunity to further your own technical skills. So, if you aren't interested in learning anything and like working in a chaotic and disorganized environment, and love working with people that have no regards for their employees this is the place for you!"
bad,"There is absolutlely no room for career advancement, especially for minority employees. There are a handful of minority employees who have been with the company, some for close to, and over 20 years, who are constantly overlooked for promotions, while outside hires are brought in, with virtually no experience. The management team, especially those in the Cherry Hill office are truly incompetent, inept and bordering on the almost clueless. This starts from the VP of the site and trickles downwards to its Managers and Supervisors. If you are willing to constantly be a yes man/woman, an I'll do anything and everything you say kind of person then you will go a long way. The management staff are solely worried about thier position within the company, and how they will benefit from it, especially now that it has been purchased from Fiserv."
bad,"The company is growing and seems to be focused more on acquiring more and more companies to place a stronghold on clients than it does on the employees well-being. Many good people have left, some of the ones remaining are abrasive and somewhat angry - making for an unpleasant work environment. The once somewhat positive benefits are now gone; like the employee reimbursement for professional education program and the expensive health plan."
bad,Not much I can say. Stay away if you do have a long term goal.
bad,You may get good $$ but the people who have work there a long time scream and yell and it is totally acceptable by management. You have to become an a _ s and yell back or you will get kicked harder everyday. Your team will throw you under the bus daily.
bad,The Division leaders are so bad and play favorites that it leads to a toxic work environment. Lots of back stabbing.  Too many chiefs and not enough Indians.
bad,"Poor communication from management, mandatory overtime, poor training. Unrealistic performance goals and very little chance for advancement. And when one is advanced, it's usually from a separate department."
bad,Worked in a filthy basement and was on call 24 7. It was the worst so happy when contract was over. Manager feudo was a witch. People weren't professional. Lied to me at interview. Said I could work from home then made me drive into the office everyday. If you could call a filthy cold basement an office. Worst experience of my life.
bad,Post merger with First Data atmosphere has become quite toxic. Communication lacks transparency. Lack of support from management. Limited flexibility.
bad,This company use to be a great company to work for. Working for 2 different locations you can see the favoritism. They like to use you for your abilities at that time and once they have no use for you they will give you an option to demote you or fire you. They do not offer proper training to anyone. They hire temporary agents and treat them just as such. The management team does not work together at all. They have to make up excuses for every problem that occurs and it’s always someone else’s fault for a mistake . The training that is offered is always offered from a outsider with no experience in set field. They don’t look for the correct staff to hire to fulfill what’s needed. The turnover rate is extremely high due to lack of training and self centered management.
bad,"Job was very stressful. very difficult to meet job matrix. management kept changing how we verify customers over the phone, which resulted in commitment failure, and write ups. changing call handle time to insure failure."
bad,"Pretty sure this job was pulled from the pits of hades.  They make you think It's great through training, but as soon as you hit the floor, it's a whole different story.  Think prison."
bad,This company will lie through there teeth just to hire people who know how to take calls. They dont care about you. They will not help you. You will work 50 hours a week and never move out of it. They will find a reason to fire you. On my way out and never looking back.
bad,"I would not advise anyone to work in the call-center even if they were in desperate need of a check, there is always somewhere better. This place does not care for their employees, if you have an emergence you're in a way guilt tripped when leaving. Oh but, if something is going on in managements lives or if they a slight sniffle, the world must stop! This company is just money hungry and it's sickening. "
bad,"This company cares about one thing, it's stock price.  Bad leadership trickles down from the top and creates a toxic culture which has driven out most of the talent.  Top that with poor pay and benefits and you're not left with much."
bad,"Management was terrible. No overtime options. Benefits were alright. Forced me to switch departments without me being okay with it, then fired me over 1 test, after being there for 20.5 years."
bad,Management was too far removed to understand what I actually did to contribute to the company. Started out on a team of 10 and was reduced to only myself to run the whole department. Didn't receive a SINGLE raise in 12 years despite winning many employee awards and accolades from all other departments.
bad,"The manager in E-payments plays favoritism.  When multiple individuals complained to HR about this, nothing was done and the company began to get worse from there.  The manager has been caught yelling and swearing at associates, lied to HR to fire multiple individuals which HR claims they have a 0 tolerance for what the manager is doing yet they are allowing it.  And the manager has been caught with having romantic relations with another member in leadership who continues to get advanced while others have been termed due to this favoritism while, again, HR has refused to do anything about this.  The company is not professional."
bad,"Management has been advanced with little or no training."
bad,"Focus 100% on clients satisfaction  and minimal on the needs of the employee satisfaction "
bad,"On average, one was expected to work into the night and on weekends....more work was constantly added and you were basically set up to fail.  Management was very unsupportive."
bad,"I had hoped to continue working at this company until retirement age, however my job was contracted out to India.  This was a huge disappointment for myself and my coworkers."
bad,Once you work your way up the more likely you will be told time has come to say goodbye.  No level above manager is safe in this company.  Watched them knife 75 people in one day!
bad,"Absolutely, NOT the company I hired in with many years ago.  Seems that with every management change (Director level and above), this company becomes more and more of a sweatshop, completely disorganized, current management style is management by intimidation, total disregard for employee well being and absolutely no work/life balance.  Manager level personnel are spineless, and always in fear of their own employment due to upper managements demands.  I would never recommend this company as a place of employment to anyone !"
bad,"There is not room to grow, they only US leads, no juniors, everything else is off shored to Indian. The quality of programming is good, but the majority of development is in India."
bad,"Work 50 plus hours a week with no recognition. Management un-supportive and own agendas. Culture is more of a sweat shop. If you speak up, you are targeted, possible demotion or termination, which is a fact for some. Poorly run location, fire drills everyday and always chasing the goal of: keep clients  happy an provide what they pay for. Senior management hides errors and lies to clients, as well as associates. People are burned out, but no one is listening. Voices in Action survey at 66%. Who wants to work at a company that only 66% of the people are ""satisfied"" with their environment? Losing clients and client trust daily. The bleeding has to stop, but needs to start at the top"
bad,Fiserv used to be a great place to work. Now they are micromanaging us to death. We have lost 7 people in last year and they have not replaced anybody. They want to do more with less and not pay us more for more workload.
bad,"Fiserv is an product based company where people are working on a same product and technology which was built 10-12 years back and there is no funds to upgrade the performance or features of the product if you give them new ideas or solutions then your career will take a hit and there will be no growth, Internal politics is at the root of the company it's like there policy."
bad,My time at Fiserv was not a good work experience at all.  Fiserv is a large company with procedures and customs that a hindrance to efficient progress and individual growth. The managers that I worked with had no clue as to how the rest of the world operates. Everyone is over worked and under paid. Moral is very low.  You are often asked to work 60 plus hours a week with no recognition or comp time.
bad,"Have a discounted cafe program for associates"
bad,"Run Machine all day until supervisor tells me to switch to a different card type .There is nothing hard at this job, when it is time to leave is the best part of the day."
bad,"not a career atmosphere, all about the quarterly bonus instead of great customer service. Hard to promote from within, they hire top positions from out of the company."
bad,"Fiserv Corrilian has no methodology foundation and its process is developed by management who has no experience or understanding of standard SDLC.  Lack of leadership in this area with their customers almost always translates into unmanagable risk and long hours to recover from poor decisions like not creating technical documentation."
bad,Needs to be restructured management and the employees there have an attitude that reeks from the door. Nobody wants to work there because of either the pay or the non stop working conditions. Over time Is great but to the point where your forced to not have a day off for months is ridiculous. My advice unless you absolutely have to please steer clear of this company.
bad,I will be brief.  One thing keeps employees at Fiserv for more than two years; Stockholm Syndrome.  It is far too late when you realize it is just a meat-grinder and outside intervention may be required to get back your confidence and perform well for an interview elsewhere.
bad,Fiserv will continually add more work however what you are offered from start is what you will leave with. Does not reward hard work but expects the most out of you
bad,"Fiserv is a huge step down from CheckFree. Fiserv moved our department from the wonderful CheckFree campus to a horrible gray low-wall cubicle farm, and stopped the two-days-work-from-home program."
bad,"In 2010, in my small department, Fiserv laid off/fired 5 employees, all African Americans who had complained of unequal treatment and 1 white man. The white man was quietly hired back into another division. The 2 employees who were fired (vs. laid off) were first put on PIPs that were proven to be untrue based on emails. There were also emails that showed a history of retaliation against 1 of the employees who had complained."
bad,High turn over rate company is a joke flat out benefits expensive no job security so you could be out of a job anytime oh yes and they just fired a whole customer service department glad I left before this never trusted this company
bad,"Average wages, legacy mentality, bad culture, frequent layoffs, chasing short term profit.  They recently took away our ability to work from home.  Most of us have been here for too long and I am not sure why we keep sticking around.  Our executives are clueless and shortsighted.  We lay off our best people and many fear for our jobs."
bad,Very frustrating and near impossible to succeed in this company’s culture if you are a female and/or person of color. Company is moving to eliminate flexible work schedules. Low pay in most markets.
bad,"I worked for this company for 15 years before making a decent wage. Then even after having worked that many years with no problems, there was a misunderstanding regarding a policy and I was fired without warning."
bad,"This company is one of the worst I have ever seen. The management is a joke. Any concerns or ideas to innovate out dated systems falls on deaf ears. Nobody cares at all about your goals or aspirations. Best advice, buddy up! The communication there is like communicating with an infant. The management seems to get off on being completely oblivious and down right deceptive. The Supervisors are cold and incompetent. This company loves to sweat the small stuff. I was there a year and my first evaluation, given I had not had one single professional interaction with my supervisor, was nothing more than them saying “I have nothing, you?” Don’t waste your time unless you are desperate for work!!!"
bad,Used to be a great company before new company leadership. No longer dedicated to company values. Upper management seems intent on not upgrading equipment that is twenty plus years old. Finally gave raises because we weren’t able to recruit workers. A shadow of what they once were
bad,"great money, and amazing time off, until they take it from you with mandatory over time, it can be very difficult for certain people. management can also seem as if you are back in high school."
bad,"Fiserv is so focused on market share that they put themselves into billions in debt to get their name out there rather than focus on their employees. They buy all of their technology because they can't get their act together to create their own. When they do try, they spend millions in consulting fees and still can't launch a product. There are so many levels of approval you can't get anything done and more time is spent in meetings to discuss progress than actual work toward the project. They let people go without ever replacing them and expect the others to pick up the work load,  creating a shortage of resources and doubling or tripling the work of those left behind.  They constantly change the structure of the organization so that no one knows who they report to anymore or what their job function is. If you balk at the change, they tell you ""you don't have to work here."" The morale is at an all time low and loyalty and length of service mean nothing."
bad,"I logged into the computer system and took incoming calls from customers. Government debit cards and unlimited fees when they are used and there are sometimes multiple payments that are accessed when used. Management was not very helpful.  Highly stressful work environment.   The hardest part of this job was dealing with very angry customers. The most enjoyaable part of this job is when I was able to get a customers money refunded right away,."
bad,Unsympathetic leadership.  My director was a pin-head and an a-hole.  Bad place to work.  Very quick to lay people off or fire them.  I would not recommend Fiserv to anyone.
bad,Very unorganized. Management is terrible . They do not help employees reach their potential or assist in the understanding the duties of the job. They kind of just throw you in the mix and sink or swim! Very cutthroat dishonest place to work
bad,Fiserv is a large company who has a lot of potential. However the poor management team and lack of care for customers creates an environment absolutely everyone hates going to. If you do not care to move up in life and are happy with low pay and lots of work this company is for you.
bad,"Great co-workers."
bad,"This place is a joke and a TERRIBLE place to work. LOW pay. Chase pays more for what we do. Benefits are ok but management SUCKS! Don't ever ask for help because they will look at you like you're an idiot. You're promised a raise after 6 months but do you get it? Nope. Never any overtime, always undertime and sending employees home. You have to use you PTO when you're sent home early if you want a full check. If not, look at your paycheck being 6 or more hours short. You use all your pto trying to get a full check to make ends meet. High turnover rate at this place. Most people leaving after 3-4 months. My training class had 15 people in it and now we're down to 2 people. Management being friends with associates gossiping about other associates. Expensive meals as well. Just bad vibes. Steer clear of this place"
bad,"Poor work culture and salaries"
bad,It was the worst work environment I've  ever seen.  Low morale among the employees.  Treated the contractors like second class citizens. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
bad,"The company was new to the Hickory, NC area."
bad,"Not a good place if you are looking for a fair work environment. Especially the Managers are very self centered, they do not have any concern for your career growth. Lots of politics."
bad,"This company might be good initially when you enter, but lot of lot of disorganization, or the middle management is belonging to south Asians in few departments and are not hiring or encouraging other language people. Or it seems they are discouraging to trained other casts..Its real, you can check. Might be top management is not aware of this. It’s very hard to learn new stuff in this discouraging environment, so the end result is more politics and lay-offs. Hardly any project completed. Mostly the particular cast/oriented south Asian Indian origin people hired in more sensitive operational and dev areas and they never involved you in your trainings or cannot share their knowledge. They do not respect your MS, Phds, or USA graduated employees at all. They few donot have good english and ultimatley it will effect the out side credit card and banking customers."
bad,"Work is not mentally challenging. No values, transparency. All in all a bad choice."
bad,Horrible Management and Supervisors. Unless you get in good and brown nose the supervisors they'll find a way to get rid of you. Stats matter but the real key to success there is being a yes man to management.
bad,"Terrible things await the innocent job hunter from Fiserv. Forget about resolving problems with HR, in my experience I found this out and was also retaliated against. So the list of good things about Fiserv doesn't exist."
bad,"As a leader, l've never experienced a more negative work environment. I'm ever the optimist and this company made me physically ill, as a result of constantly having to place my employees on disciplinary action. In some cases you placed them on multiple write ups.  I wouldn't recommend this company to my friend or enemies as a career option."
bad,Great place to work if you enjoy drama working with a bunch of idiots that only promote the messy family and or friends. Terrible micromanaging favoritism and bullying. HR is a joke and corporate well anywho. Yeah great place not to work if you have any ethics
bad,"If you want a steady pay check this will be a good place. The work overall is easy, however you do have to put some effort into your overall work. The work floor is toxic. Leadership- (Managers/Supervisors/PEL'S) are dysfunctional. Manager is more of a entry level supervisor. He constantly changes his word what he communicates to you. You have to watch out for him because h.r is on his side. The supervisors don't care and are lazy and very unprofessional. The pel's are really the only people that help. A couple of them you have to watch out for because they always go to hr or leadership for stupid stuff. Supervisors always off the floor along with manager. Oh the supervisors are worst than the agents with gossip and unprofessionalism. None of the leaders lead by example. New supervisors internally pretty much gets away with anything since they aren't ramped up properly. Very clicky, if you are not a yes man you will get advance. The only thing i enjoy about Fiserv is i got a check. thankfully i was able to get out. You do have some people who care or probably used to care but the people that are supposed to support you aren't supportive. It a cya type of mindset."
bad,There is a clear lack of leadership. Be prepared to be thrown under the bus. Managers blow off meetings or fail to schedule them. They create moving targets for bonuses. When an error is made leadership does not own the error. Its put on on another team or used to coach the person who brought the error to light.  Communication doesn't exist. Its literally constant fires being put out by managers only to be undercut by leadership.
bad,Not a place that I would recommend anybody to work at. Poor management and not fair the there employees at all. No work balance. Work on most holidays.
bad,"I have to say my experience there was not great, reviews were negative going in - I should have read them more thoroughly............................."
bad,This job would be good for a single person fresh out of high school or college. But not for a single parent or family person. The do not honor any dr notes. If your child is sick or even has surgery and you have to be out you will get wrote up.
bad,Fiserv has declined over the years in the caring of the employees and communication. Training is non existed. Employees are wonderful to work with. But the employers do not applicate hard work.  A lot of favoritism in the work place
bad,"Took this position and held for 8 months (as this is all I could take). Never had I needed anti-anxiety medication until this job (and I found out literally our whole team was on it). There is absolutely no training. The ""knowledge solution"" database for answers to client questions has been abandoned YEARS ago. Constant consolidation of departments and products so you cannot keep up. You are in the dark. Your clients’ work in banks and need answers to very complex questions NOW. You have to remote into their computer and act like you know what you are doing. You open a ticket, say you will contact them back, and then pray you can ask a coworker for the answer (even though you are capable of finding answers to questions at previous jobs). It is literally horrible. The only positive thing was the beautiful office space and the wonderful benefits. I would never recommend this job to a friend and I would pray that I never end up in a position like this again. Feeling hopeless to do your job leaves you feeling helpless, and this is never a good feeling.  I WISH it had been different. I wanted a long time career with Fiserv when I applied (having used some of their other products while at other Financial Firms for 15 years)."
bad,This place left a bad taste in my mouth. The trainer was more interested in numbers than training. People I worked with were okay.
bad,I was a BA and it is the worst place I have ever worked. Technology is completely outdated and the management team is incompetent.
bad,The company will not adjust your salary even when the cost of living increases. Expected to work to the bone with no incentives.
bad,"There is absolutlely no room for career advancement, especially for minority employees. There are a handful of minority employees who have been with the company, some for close to, and over 20 years, who are constantly overlooked for promotions, while outside hires are brought in, with virtually no experience. The management team, especially those in the Cherry Hill office are truly incompetent, inept and bordering on the almost clueless. This starts from the VP of the site and trickles downwards to its Managers and Supervisors. If you are willing to constantly be a yes man/woman, an I'll do anything and everything you say kind of person then you will go a long way. The management staff are solely worried about thier position within the company, and how they will benefit from it, especially now that it has been purchased from Fiserv."
bad,work started at 10:45 pm . Very busy. I used to work with three to four other people. I barely took a break sometime. Some of my co-workers were really great to work with. The best part of the job were my coworker. The hardest part was staying up.
bad,"The management talks about the company as if it is a great place to work at. No it’s not it’s a lot of favoritism, stress, if you try your best you get put down for it, if you ask questions they make you feel dumb, and they make you change your schedule every 6 months. Benefits are good just they need to change management"
bad,Fiserv comes first. Upper management will say family first but it’s all about the Fiserv way.  You will be expected to work 40-60 hours per week as well as weekends (just to keep up)
bad,Depending on the division the support and system documentation can be very poor relying on experienced workers to provide system operational support.  If there is no one with the experience it comes down to trying to figure it out which can be very frustrating if you don't know the detail complexities that make the specific product work.
bad,"Was originally hired for one line of business after a couple of months they forced us to learn 3 other lines of business which actually can be broken up to like 10 other types.  You must give correct greeting and closure or risk poor quality, you must authenticate each call correctly which is different on each call and then once you finally get it they go and change the authentication and you start all over again, once again leading to poor quality scores.  Since they are paid by call you are expected to keep all calls within a call time, or get a ding which again gives poor score, you are timed for calls and after call work.  Everything is so much more about keeping times down and getting more calls and not about customer card.  The call card care but its more like card lack of care get off  the phone so I can take another call.  They get you so stressed out about all these scores and times you must be within. They beat you up if you are taking breaks or lunch late cause your out of adherence yet another score does not matter that it was cause you were on a call. The beat you up if you take too long working a case cause your not taking calls... honestly its very stressful.  Every move you make there is scored and makes you feel like you are walking on eggshells all the time... is this the day I will be fired.... I sit and watch my co workers freak up when scorecard is bad wondering is this a write up or a walk you out.  It just should not feel like everyday could be your last"
bad,"Fiserv pays well. That is it. Everything else from Management to HR & the job culture is a complete sham! This job REALLY taught me not all money is good money, and I left after almost two years. I had to save what was left of myself & my mental health."
bad,I spent most of my time on paper work and not developing. Development process is complete waterfall. The culture is so far from agile it's scary. Management culture is totally autocratic.
bad,Good luck. It's a mess and they will get rid of you if you aren't a chosen few. But ew sups are terrible except for a few I know well. Others are climbing the ladder.
bad,"Their pay is extremely low, at least in some areas.  Management had a bad habit of telling you one thing for months then do something totally different without warning. Poor communication and some management played favorites."
bad,"Company has a lot of management and executive layers."
bad,"Enjoy my co-workers. They try to give you an enjoyable time. Overrall the place is nice if you aren't working in the call center. If you are of color you seem to be let go alot more often than others. Reasons for being fired are pushed upon "
bad,"I honestly wouldn't really recommend this job to anyone, the management was uncoordinated and all over the place. Their systems are completely outdated and to take one call you had to use upwards of 12 separate programs on one computer screen, the whole company was very disorganized."
bad,I actually really liked the work and most of my co workers. But this place created its own hostile work environment and hr and mgmt seemed to pick and choose what harassment or other issues that they wanted to address and ignored others! They did raise they pay which a great thing but for the type of work we were doing it still was below scale.
bad,"My Manager was so busy with her other jobs, she was hands off on our department and let my co-worker become a dictator. She had no knowledge of Workforce Management."
bad,Fiserv Trust Services went out of business several years ago. They did not keep up with their competitors and were blind to their own irrelevancy and incompetence.
bad,Most co-workers were friendly and helpful. Frequency of new or change in procedures overwhelming.  Lack of adequate/usable training provided but still expected to assist clients.
bad,Managers do not support an employee with any advancements. You are loaded with work and expected to work weekends. Director of IS was horrible and a bully. Not given enough time to train and expected to deliver without a simple typo mistake.
bad,You would come into work and start your day.  I was supposed to have weekly meetings with the VP I supported since he worked out of North Carolina.  Working with a remote manager was very difficult at times.  Poor communication between me and my manager.  I had no co-workers since I was working for a remote manager for a department outside of King of Prussia.
bad,"Working at Fiserv for nine years, I actually realized that this company is really unprofessional because we do not have any supportive management teams. However, this company is all about the numbers, but not how I personally grow and develop my working expertise. From what I am perceiving, all the employees are treated unfairly by the managers, supervisors, and coordinators. No one seems to care or do anything about many problems or issues cause by all employees. All employees also have to work extra hard for the company with less pays and with no showing appreciations. The only one thing I like about this company is that the job duties or tasks I am doing or serving in my position is very easy, and I am very enjoy working with my coworkers. To me, all my coworkers seem to be very polite, helpful, and fun people to work with. Therefore, this is  what I am expected more of a big company with great workers or employees."
bad,A typical day at work varies greatly depending on what shift you get hired for. A typical first/second shift day is answering 100+ phone calls while 3rd shift is mostly clerical with the entire group taking less than 200 calls collectively. They start playing trivia in the early AM and read books until their shifts end.
bad,The pay is the only thing good about this job. The higher ups are money hungry and do not really care about their employees and they have no problem proving it to you.
bad,"There are many good people at this company. it's huge and getting bigger. There are also leaders who have no connection to or understanding of the work being done on the ground. When questions about resources and personnel needs to match the quantity of work come up, that will be ignored. You can work your tail off, and show good results and meet or exceed your goals, but it won't matter if the wrong person has a different idea of your worth. The culture is so-so. Depends on your business unit. They are unorganized when it comes to different units working together, and random, arbitrary org changes that make no sense seem to be the way of life. They're kind of a google wanna-be because they are a tech company, but the culture hardly matches up with modern tech organizations. "
bad,It was a real productive working environment. Can be fast paced or slow depending on the amount of work that day. I didnt really enjoy it because of my supervisor .
bad,Job was outsourced did work of a mailroom and was on feet all day moving to facepaced machine with operator loading mail trays to keep pace with quota
bad,"This job was by far the easiest I've had, they gave free lunch on mandatory OT days, had bunch of prizes and fun things to do, easy going coworkers. The only real issue was harassment and discrimination of their non-Caucasian employees."
bad,I like the work that they provide but as far as the company I would like to part ways from.  I stand on my feet for 12 hours a day and produce their credit cards and a lot of the times they don't like to pay all of my differential and overtime that I put in.  Management shows a lot of favoritism even from the higher ups as far as overhead of HR.
bad,This company has potential. But only if they take action on what the employee needs are as well as consumer demands. To travel daily to an work environment unsure of job security is scary.
bad,Managers need more training .  No advantage of getting promoted or transferring to other jobs.  Vacation time is taken away and made into sick time.   Not a good company to work for.
bad,The training I received was awful. They did not have proper experienced trainers. I had co workets who trained me  had no experience on how to trained
bad,"Horrible organization.  24 Months of misery.  The ineptitude was mind-boggling.  The culture was horrendous.  No one co-operated with anyone and nothing got done.  Workers working at home hoarded information in attempt to remain irreplace-able, and thus be able to still work at home."
bad,They will replace you in 2 seconds non job security they never shut down for bad weather you can be hospitalized and they will still harass you to come back to work.
bad,"I have been employed there for 6 years and the pay is awful. Can't make a living with the cost of living going up. Never get a bonus since they haven't changed our new bonus policy. The points system is awful and heaven forbid if you have to be out of work for being sick, they will not even accept a Doctors note. Trying to get off for Vacation days is a joke. I haven't never worked for a place that is so strict. They hire new employees that are making more then me and something isn't right with that. I would not refer anyone to work there."
bad,"Fiserv, Was a great experience. It's great work enviroment"
bad,"during the 20 years working at Fiserv I had several managers, some were good, others were not."
bad,High employee turn over. Low employee moral. Low hourly compensation compared to other financial institutes who provide the same services.
bad,Worked with this company for 3 months before the company announced it was closing. Not sure why the company continued to hire new employees when management knew the company was going under.
bad,"Fiserv / formerly Checkfree is a poorly run organization. Leadership is aware of the issues yet they continue to turn a blind eye. There are salary inequities all over the organization that remain unresolved. The longer one works for Fiserv, the further they fall behind the average pay band while you're expected to train newly hired team members making more than you. There is also a culture of bullying and intimidation that starts at the leadership level. If you complain, or stand up for yourself, you end up with a target on your back and you'll be fired or placed on the ""lay-off"" list, which happens almost every quarter. "
bad,"I worked for this company for almost a year, when I started I loved my job, slowly it became a nightmare. The managers are heartless and cold, the pay is way less than it should be for what you do. Its a call center for Bank of Americas Bill Pay on their website. A typical day was getting cussed out by customers who have no clue how to use the website or its features. You would get 2 breaks and a lunch but if you were a minute late you either got written up or coached about time management. The hardest part was how no team lead or manager would help you with anything but they could tell you in a heart beat what you did wrong. Just a negative place all around. Bofa made a lot of changes to the way we worked which in turn made it hard to want to be there. I loved my co workers they were some of the best people I have ever met, I have made some lasting friendships. The most enjoyable part of the day was when we got to leave and go home."
bad,Hours were good. To get advancement was difficult. Some supervisors/teamleads did not know the job. You could ask questions of Manager and only got the answers they wanted to give.
bad,"Was only Mgr to my department that had no meetings, reviews, etc. with my manager.  2 others had regularly scheduled daily training. "
bad,"Current mid-management are all 20 year old individuals. A few are actually interested in the work, but most seem to be taking a free ride once they get promoted. Those individuals are NOT interested in helping a hard working person advance. Just the opposite, because they are not held accountable for retention of staff. At the Phoenix AZ. location the building is in neglected condition, the bathrooms are awful, and the computers, and software are outdated."
bad,"Work expectations are not equivalent with pay level. Maturity level is inadequate for the the type of sensitive data that is exchanged through the day to day procedures. Management is not based on skill level, but by who you know."
bad,They were racist and there was blatant favoritism! You only got promoted if you knew somebody or if you were kissing the boss's butt. Working hard only got you the 40 hours a week on a paycheck. Advancement was for brown nosers! Two thumbs down
bad,I'm a easygoing person who likes to work and enjoy working with others. I enjoy playing basketball and football and working in the yard. I like to visit family and friends. I just bought a Hummer h3 and enjoy driving around town.
bad,"Would not recommend anyone staying there long term. You're stuck on the phone at all times, expected to meet unattainable goals."
bad,"Very good company to start, but with each change of middle and senior management the ""Do the right thing"" culture as continued to  take a nose dive, forcing moral downward.  Along with higher demands on time and effort, spur of the moment overtime with no firm end, and now no breaks and only 30 minutes for lunch after working 4 straight hours....Horrible place to become employed."
bad,"Corporate atmosphone, overbearing performance management, unreasonable expectations. There is nothing more to say at this time"
bad,"Middle and upper management haven't a clue what they are doing."
bad,This was not a very good company to work for. The management are very degrading to their employees.
bad,average 80-120 calls per 8 hr shift
bad,"trained by someone who just got promoted off the phones- needless to say I got to hear a lot of bashing of my new team / company. Person supposed to train me worked remote (10 mins from the office) but refused to come in. "
bad,"When I first started, I was brought in under a manager who left not long after I started. She was great to work with and had a firm grasp of the code and business. However, after she left, the other manager who took over was very clueless and did not have good management skills. She rarely spoke with me and ended the contract without explanation."
bad,I worked there 5.5 years..had a number of years under my belt already.They would hire people w/no experience train them & then promote them quickly. Mainly because they where white males and they liked them... female promotion I didn’t see much at this location.
bad,"I worked for the company for a few years. Management was soemetimes around. HR was pretty decent. You could always go to talk to at least one of them. Then they got rid of HR last Christmas. Big Mistake. Now you can never find anyone. The guy from corporate comes around and acts like he knows everything. Managers talk to us crazy. RUN! Do not come here. Management does not care about long hours, mandatory OT and there is no one to speak to."
bad,If you're not kissing the managers butt and actually speak up on their wrong doings they will find any reason to fire you their attendance policy is dumb and confusing you have no life working here everybody acts like children not a career job no room for advancement unless you're white
bad,Fiserv moved into hickory as the textile industry moved out.  They came down from Aurora IL with the intention to save money by providing former textile workers scraps.  The pay is extremely low.  In 2015 I was offering my new hires 9.50 an hour when my peers in OH were offering almost $15 yet the cost of living was about the same.  The leadership staff is poorly educated and stagnant.  This office operates like a middle school.  I was fortunate enough to report to an amazing manager who was able to develop me and we have both chosen to seek other opportunities outside of the company.
bad,It is a great place to work if you do not mind a lot of stress and lack of any supervising or management presence. You are expected to make decisions on your own and if they’re wrong you will face consequences. Management does not care about you or what you have going on they only care about service levels and making them look good. Even if the weather is extremely bad or you are deathly sick you are expected to be at work or are punished attendance wise. No exceptions!
bad,"At Fiserv, you are belittled and talked down to by upper management. the supervisors and managers are very unprofessional. This place can bring the strongest person to tears. No matter how hard you work it is overlooked and people has actually fell out and went to hospitals because of the stress and pressure they are under."
bad,"by the time i had decided to quit in 2016 I had no work to do. we sat around waiting for work to come over from the few banks we had left in the Omaha building. "
bad,"Good job when you have to go somewhere to work and be held accountable for what your responsibility is, best thing is to know what you are doing."
bad,"Facility of building is nice BUT.........."
bad,not a good fit for me.  I don't want to be on the phones all day  Too strict and they expect perfection.  I do not want to spend my career here.
bad,"This is where you want to work if you enjoy being more intelligent and creative than upper management. I was hired and told to challenge the status quo. I knew there were issues when there were two open positions for operations managers and the site ""leader"" hired two of his pals from his last job rather than look for the most talented and motivated candidates. Definitely the most blatant cronyism I have ever witnessed. As a mid-level manager I presented several innovative ideas it was clear they could not come close to embracing any kind of change. It's one thing to be told no or not now but to be looked at like you're an alien was disrespectful. This happened multiple times."
bad,"Fiserv is a company that does not respect its employees' advancement needs. I worked here almost 2 years and have no received a single raise. During this time, they hired new employees at a base pay rate that was higher than mine though i had acquired seniority. My brother, who worked in a different department, was laid off because the company decided to move his particular position to another company site located in Hickory, NC. They had the tenured associates (including my brother) train those new hires in Hickory for their job. Essentially, the tenured associates trained their new hire replacements. In turn, the tenured associates were laid off without notice and were given severance packages. I disagree with this business practice. It was under-handed and they left their tenured associates high and dry."
bad,"Overall, serious morale problems in most areas, especially core area of IT operations.  Leadership lacking and self-serving.  Maintaining shareholder value, but that cannot last based on very large turnover.  Salaries extremely low, as much as 25-30% below market and more. "
bad,Fiserv comes off to be a great place to work but as you get through training you learn that the only way to move up in the company is to kiss a**! They do not respect their agents and when you sit with human resources to discuss any issues she blows you off and completely disregards anything you say! I would not recommend this job for anyone!
bad,"The people are great, but the company has the mentality that everyone is replaceable. The current CEO has no idea what he's doing and it shows."
bad,"Very immature and unprofessional atmosphere at times. Other times, reasonably flexible. I'm not going to say too much other than despite downfalls within the company, I enjoyed networking with many diverse cultures."
bad,Suffers from bad leadership .  Cio was off base and vp levels were scared to support teams.  They do not honor down time and think they own the enployees.
bad,"First the good things: The floor was clean and well organized with good lighting. The company provided food once every two months, for some type of party."
bad,Anything you have is never guaranteed. They will change things on you in a heart beat and not care about what it may do to you because you are REPLACEABLE.
bad,"Fiserv is a very stressful job, not only do you have to put up with a lot of verbal abuse from customers but Fiserv also has poor management. Management can at times be rude, mean, disrespectful, etc... Also Human Resources doesn't care about the employees."
bad,"Demands of employees is high and pay is not competitive.  Cross training is available but once you are trained in more than one area, management determines which department you work in on any given day even though they promise to never remove you from your primary role once you are cross trained."
bad,"The culture in IT is toxic and abusive: high turnover, high pressure, no work life balance.  The work from home policy creates the expectation that you are always at work.  It drains the employees and lowers the morale."
bad,"Very fast paced, upper management id not open to change and they mirco manage there staff. No career advancement and that makes for heavy turnover. Overall nice staff,"
bad,if you are not part of a clique your chances of moving up are slim to none. the job isnt that bad it's the management that makes the company terrible.
bad,"Unless you are directly generating $$$ for this company, expect to be treated as if you don't exist. No matter how loyal & hard working you are; they will not care about you. Managers play favorites & will lie outright on your performance reviews to ensure you get the worst raise possible. They will dump the work of 3 employees on you then criticize you for not getting the work done. HR & inept managers will actively encourage you to go to them with problems, etc. & then use it as a weapon against you."
bad,"It was good when I started and after the last 3 months has gone down hill. You have a lot of responsibility to deal with along with new rules they throw at you every day. Communication not good, manager has no idea about running a machine and if you give your 2 weeks they fire you the next day. So much for professionalism.  For a fortune company pay is horrible for the amount of work you do. Not a place you can advance. Your pto vanishes when they send you home because there's no work. Just a band aid job till you can find something better"
bad,"Bad benefits, worse pay, and garbage management. They want to promote an atmosphere as though they care and they are second to none but they have no direction or consistency."
bad,"You will work long hours. Pay is not competitive for the market, which results in high turnover. Travel is the one bright spot, however, you will generally work 12+ hour days while on site."
bad,"Working at Fiserv was a frustrating experience due to lack of capital investments in systems and processes. Though the company invests heavily in product innovation, there is little/no investment in retaining or promoting the talent that drives the innovation."
bad,Co workers said you learn the hard way around here....No support from management team.
bad,"The company lacks Diversity, in cutlures and generations."
bad,"It took three weeks to get a phone. Another month to get a computer only to have the project manager go on a week's vacation. This was in the Stafford,  TX office. Most of the staff felt underpaid and unappreciated  my project manager I suspect was racist."
bad,"It's a very competitive environment for the employees there.  Moving up the chain seems like ""survival of the fittest"", oppose to being based off performance.   That is counter productive."
bad,"Fiserv has amazing benefits and great pay, but their operations are not the best. Management and supervisors are not involved in the normal working environment, high stress positions, obvious favoritism and advancing is near impossible unless you are favored. Hours inconsistent"
bad,I loved the culture at Fiserv. I was just unfortunate to work for a department manager that had it out for me from day one. They were supposed to interview me and never did. Then they literally never said a word to me when I started which was 2 weeks after the original date I was set to start. The team was great and others were nice from different departments. The office is state of the art and has many nice perks working for the company. I was just never given the proper opportunity to feel fully welcomed and valued. The Manager of AR was not the most professional and made bad decisions that didn't seem to affect them. They showed favoritism and treated certain employees liek they weren't truly apart of the team.
bad,"Fiserv is the only job I’ve ever had where, despite how hard I worked, I still felt like I could be fired any moment for any reason (even for no fault of my own). Training is minimal, security is extreme. Overtime is common, often mandatory, and carries a heavier punishment if missed. Attendance policy is harsh. Access to your check stub is only possible IN THE BUILDING. HR is nonexistent/not helpful/foreign outsourced. Communication between departments is basically non existent."
bad,"This Fortune 500 company decided they were too cheap to pay the Hickory Returns team to do the job they were doing and instead aend the dept. to India AND make the Returns team train our replacements."
bad,Work here for a short time after I was laid off from another position and left because there was no opportunity to advance.  Pay and benefits were not very good.
bad,My time at Fiserv wasn't a bad one per say. The management was just always talking and didn't seem to be doing work. The job was extremely lonely especially being on a phone all day answering 100+ phone calls.
bad,It was an ok company to work for. Resistance to making changes regarding process improvements as many folks had difficulty understanding why it's necessary to improve things.
bad,"The company was not rewarding for the good work you do , they expect people to work 50-60 hour weeks , not even allowing people to take their earned vacations."
bad,"It's a good place to work if you just need a check.  The health insurance is overpriced and they are strict with meeting metrics that have nothing to do with the actual job. They offer no sick time regardless of life happenings and getting time off results in a point system that will have you jobless, quickly. So, don't get sick, need health insurance, have life issues, or need to call off, for any reason."
bad,"Very high paced; high stress company. There are several different expectations for one role; none are clearly defined and vary constantly. "
bad,"A typical day involves helping a number of internal customers on short notice for production problems."
bad,Company is going through a big re-org. Let a lot of people go without trying to find another place for them. Now I see they appear to be hiring. Good luck to them.
bad,"This location is great for workers with a small amount of office experience to gain knowledge.  The location has very little upward movement, limited career development for advanced employees, and still uses a nepotistic values for promoting employees into management positions.  "
bad,This is the place where I gained experience with my leadership skills.  Became a youngset coordinator of the company. I supervise evening and overnight shifts.  12 hour days five days a week.
bad,When the Corporate office took over all centers in the USA the employees had no voice and management slowly took away benefits and compensations.
bad,"no, not what you think, for family its certainly stressful.  I had not work life balance.  A day off was like pulling teeth."
bad,Fiserv EFT has a great group of staff.  Salaries and benefits are very competetive.  Company growth while I was there was significant which seemed to impact management's ability to structure support in an effective manner.
bad,"I would not recommend Fisev as a place to go to grow in your career. Management is focused on appearance of progress rather than dealing with the issues. There is not a unified strategy, Fiserv is several business with duplicate projects and services;"
bad,"This is an okay place to work. Free fountain drinks! Lots of changes going on, some for the best others not so much. They try to have things going on for their employees but you can only participate during your breaks which is sometimes really hard to do. Management is a joke, don't look for one if you are in need of one for an escalated call, they all run and hide and don't help. When one gives you an answer don't expect it to be the same response once you question them about it, they change what they say and tell you they never said what they actually did. They are one of the lowest in matching 401K."
bad,"Very poorly run office. Management is unresponsive, unwilling, uncooperative and lazy. Coworkers are really nasty in Cash Management and the management allows this, even listening to some employees about who can sit where. They take on large projects that they are not prepared for and expect employees to work the extra hours to make up for this. "
bad,"Worst Mangement, boring culture, no planning, managers have to learn how to talk to the sub-ordinates. they have very less project management skills."
bad,"* Culture is very sterile (not social, lots of sihlos but changing)"
bad,"many good individuals there, but definitely NOT a ""people"" company; very short-term focus."
bad,"Ideas are ignored...Don't have a solution. Unless it is corporate speak, forget about it."
bad,"Operate inserting machines to get mail sent in a timely manner, second shift doesn't leave much time for family and rest working 6 nights a week."
bad,Corporation Security Policies are making my work extreamly difficult
bad,"I didn't work here long, but the hours were unfriendly and the management did not care about their employees."
bad,"I worked for Fiserv, came in as a temp and was trained to do a job i was great at, then they outsourced my job and tried me to do another that required way more time that was not allowed I was there seven months and should have been offered a job within the first 30-90 days and they did not, then they fired all of the Temps without notice and mailed my belongings to me. I tried numerous times to get back in the door but in another department and always had issues with website. They best thing about the company is the Pay. I would have stayed. The training is all you get, supervisors were way too busy to coach you so unless your a quick learner and extremely bright dont  bother for the call center, csr postions."
bad,They have a lot of overtime if you are not looking to do so much don't apply. They have different scheduling for everyone you can be Sunday- Thursday or Monday- Friday.
bad,"Management lacks vision"
bad,Fiserv is a great company to work. there is a lot of energy and momentum. Company has a beautiful office and great teams. agile implementation was supported whole heartedly from the top management to the individual associate.
bad,It is difficult to take any time off due to the work load.  Many people have left the organization as a result of  poor management and lack of career development and progression.  Many colleagues have been in the same role for over 10 years with no opportunity to move up in the organization.
bad,Stay away from this company ! They will rid of you quickly if you do not qualify for their fake smiles and personalities. Sneaky and conniving individuals
bad,"The company is not bad but management within the Debit Client Services Team. There is little to no work/iife balance, and management does not value your time."
bad,It started out as enjoyable. But over the years it became more difficult. Constant changes (which is  expected in the corporate world) and short times to learn them. But they didn't compensate for the new job roles. Did not feel valued as a employee or person.
bad,"Fiserv back in the 2009 was a great place to work because you worked hard but you learned so much and your work had meaning and quality.  Returning back to the organization in 2019 has shown me how much it has lost that sparkle.  Now, it is like working at a old school factory where you do your work and go home. People talk a good talk but that is all that remains.  The enthusiasm and the empowerment to go the extra mile to build in quality is lost. Now everyone must stay in their own lane and suggestions or innovation are not encouraged."
bad,"They claim to be a finacial center, but they deal with closing the leases for GM. There is no financial transactions taking place. All I was there for was to fill a seat during their busy time"
bad,"Fiserv has helped me to live and pay my bills for over the past 10 years, so there will be no Fiserv bashing.  At times it has been a really good company to work for, affording me solid work experience.  What I will say is this:  If continuing my employment there had a positive future outlook for me, we wouldn't be having this conversation.  I am very grateful  for many opportunities that I have been given by Fiserv.  I have worked with some pretty awesome people.  The hardest part of the job for me has been not advancing like I felt I should have, and difficult management scenarios in part.  The most enjoyable part of the job - getting to use my Graphic Design skills, the paycheck, the company events.... and the friends I've made."
bad,"I've applied to Fiserv twice and have had the same experience both times.  The company will ""hire"" people several weeks before a training class and then call applicants a week ahead of the  start date to say that they have over hired and that anyone who was ""over hired"" can be in the next training class a month later, usually a less desirable position and schedule.  Also, what is not told to the applicant at the time of hire is that if you are not ""certified"" for your position you will be terminated prior to completing training.  DO NOT quit a job to go to Fiserv.  They play too many games."
bad,As a BA you are able to assist retirees in making health plan decisions. We also handled their Spending Accounts. Many time calls are forwarded to another department to resolve spending account issues which were not in line with other departments.
bad,The people there are pretty great but management only looks out for management.  Managers do not always know what's going on and some have long outdated visions of technology they cannot go beyond.
bad,Work consists of meetings about meetings allowing teams to not complete projects. Cylos are being built causing poor communication from the top down. Upper management struggles to understand what the Nashville facility truly does.
bad,"Employees are treated as liabilities.  The longer you work for Fiserv, the less you are valued.  They look for reasons to remove long-term talent and replace them with lower-paid overseas workers."
bad,"Nice folk. Large office - lots of cubicles.  Good lunchroom"
bad,"unrealistic goals"
bad,Again I don't really remember to much of working there.  There were mice than ran over my foot every evening.  The travel to and from work was very long and stressful as well.
bad,"A typical day on the job was book keeping training and help in"
bad,"The Company has no room for advancement and the people that are advanced are only done so because they are friends with the higher ups, not because of their work performance."
bad,"The department I worked in was stressful, no room for advancement, the position I accepted ended up to be working for the Executive Assistant and not the Dept Mgr like I was led to believe, employees, co-workers were not friendly or helpful, company wasn't all it's cracked up to be."
bad,I did not enjoy my stint at Fiserv to say the least. The lack of balance between work life and school life didn't help either. A lot of political games were played and the lack of communication made things worse. The biggest problem for me was that I as well as my co-workers dealt with micromanagement. It was not a healthy work environment to say the least.
bad,"It's an OK place to work. They like to pay the people running the machines more because that's who makes them money. The ones that work behind the scenes get paid unfairly, especially in shipping and receiving."
bad,"I did not enjoy working for Fiserv. I left due to poor management, no training, the people there were not very nice, and I was just unhappy"
bad,Call Center growth is limited and pay rates are marketably low. Benefits however are good and available on first day. Easy interview process and hiring is quick.
bad,"Initially the company was a fun place to be, everyone cannot wait to get to work, coworkers were sociable, even with a ton of work workers did not mind spending overtime without additional pay, however upper management decided that our department will be transfered out of state, and then the layoffs started giving rise to a sad environment and a low morale decended on the remaining employees"
bad,"It was a basic starting point into the industry, not much more than that! Initially this firm seemed like a professional environment however after 11 months of training and daily full time employment I have come to the conclusion that there are much more stable and well run professional firms out there for me to engage and formulate me a much better career future then what Fiserv offers."
bad,"Lack in management initiative to create a cordial relationship with current and new clients. Multiple departments within the company don't work towards ""One company, One goal"" to achieve the growth potential available in online/mobile banking industry."
bad,I have worked here for many years and have had barely any raises. Not a great place to work.
bad,"Whoever wrote that this job was like working in a production line but in an office setting is right!"
bad,"The numerous acquisitions have left their departments unorganized and unreliable. It is difficult to know who to reach out to for assistance, and there is little, if any, support from management. New employees are enticed by competitive salaries but left to navigate on their own once in the door. There is no official onboarding, and their intranet is confusing and not at all user friendly. I would not advise anyone to accept employment at Fiserv."
bad,"No direction on how to handle irate clients - developers were not well versed with mobile technologies. Upper management liked to play the ""blame game"" instead of finding solutions."
bad,"The company is fairly simple to get in, however once you are in things get complicated. I have worked there for almost 2 years and they have rolled out or changed every single thing about every system multiple times. Changing many of the requirements for over the phone assistance in my department. Giving us more required phrases and taking time away from call lengths. We are supposed to see our supervisor at least once a month to discuss my numbers. im lucky to do it once a quarter. As for interpersonal relations with co workers is difficult since you are always on the phone. The hardest part of the job is the rudeness of people that you are helping. It makes me sad to even think that people with the attitudes they have treat a total stranger the way im treated. So if you are thick skinned and can take the abuse go for it. if not then take the job for the experience on the resume."
bad,You cant support yourself on the low pay. After years you will not even make $11a hour. The supervisors are bad. Dont expect to ever make more than $11 a hour. The health insurance is not worth paying.
bad,"I spent every day helping customers complete online payments for over 200 companies, In my short time there, I learned, through coworkers, how to maintain a postitive attitude, and how to control emotions when people are screaming at you. Tenured coworkers can help a lot if they grow fond of you. Management is the most difficult part of the job. You cannot teach, or expect, an employee to learn how to treat people with professionalism if you are constantly letting them know they are not important, and they do not matter. They have no regard for employee moral, and they do not show their appreciation for anything you do. They will, however, hold meetings when things are not going well, to let you know how bad you are doing. There was no motiviation to dedicate myself to this postion. They show favoritism, enforcing rules only on the people they are not fond of, and they choose to discipline, and get the last word in, rather than help employees understand. The entire department does nothing but stroke their egos all day. I would not work there again, nor would I recommend that job to anyone. The most enjoyabl part of the job are the customers. Sure, I came across rude, ridiculous people, but when you are frustrated about leadership, and you feel like the company has no regard for you as a human being, a polite, reasonable, understanding customer can change your mood, and motivate you to do your job."
bad,"Worked with great people, some of which I worked with at JPMorgan because JP was their most significant customer."
bad,"Employees are overworked, underpaid, unappreciated and lack clear career path, Employees are not compensated based on performance, rather an formulaic approach going across bands. There is no clear direction or plan for structuring and job security was a yearly concern."
bad,"It's a decent job to have, great benefits and raises. Your ability to go far in the company is mostly based on your personal relationship with management and social life. There is a lot of drama and if you aren't close with the team leaders they are quick to kick you to the curb regardless of your success, and achievements. Overall, the job itself is wonderful."
bad,"Has gone consistently downhill in the 6 years I have worked there. Benefits have shrank, wages that do not keep up with the cost of living and poor work/life balance."
bad,As long as you stay busy and away from people you’ll be fine. Be sure to pay close attention to everything you are working on and less attention to people around you.
bad,Everyone I know that works there knows that a job at Fiserv is very very very stressful and unorganized. It's what you get in a corporate call center I guess and they do have good benefits and pay for someone with no education or experience.
bad,"Great facility with lots of perks. Work from home flexibility which was really great.   Great potential, but the ETG PMO could use a complete leadership transformation. The ETG PMO was completely unorganized and focused on things that were not productive.  PMs were the fall guy for everything and the PMO management  was not supportive.  Engineers were completely overworked and PMs blamed when they made mistakes.  Managers were in cliques and targeted team members who were under Managers they didn't lkme."
bad,The environment at Fiserv is extremely unorganized. The sales are down which in turn limits the number of implementations.  The management team is very disengaged and the there is minimal chance of advancement.
bad,"I enjoyed working there at first, then it became people treating me different, because i was not a full time hire on, so therefore i had to find something else. Job balancing there was difficult at first but then got the hang of it, but the bosses are not very helpful"
bad,"This company is no longer in business. When I was working there, roughly 85% of their work was transferred overseas to India to save money. They realized that plan didn't work and sold it to another document recording agency a few years later. But it was not a bad environment to work in at all. The people were pleasant and everyone seemed to get along."
bad,"I worked at a different call center prior to working at Fiserv and I must say that Fiserv training is crummy. There was too much information to learn in such little time, and associates were put on the floor when( in my opinion) most of them were not ready. Associates are not well compensated with the job. This position’s starting salary should not be less than $16-$17 per hr."
bad,"When I came on board, the manager that interviewed me had quit.  12 people from the teams quit, while I was there 6 people were out on ""medical leave"".   The stress of constant calls and trying to assist customers to a high level was beyond belief.   Terrible call center 47% dropped calls daily,  no new managers hired. 10+ minute hold times for customers."
bad,The people I worked with are great but the overall vibe was really bad. There is a lot of negativity going on and the management are not an exception to this.
bad,"Sad an employee can be loyal to this company for 10 plus years and you can be out with a tap of your shoulder,  granted there may not be a better way."
bad,The company has good intentions but a very cold culture and in general an unpleasant place to work. The leadership really must change from the CEO down to make a real impact in the industry.
bad,"The culture has negatively evolved over the years. It seems to be in a downward spiral."
bad,"Loved it, but it was about who you know and you have to be extremely flexible with your work hours.  ***************************************************"
bad,A new management train rolls through every few years.  Some have been great.  Most haven't.  Fiserv will typically buy a new company and mandate integration to that company's products without really understanding them.  You'll burn a few years and then a new purchase.
bad,"HR policies are not implemented fairly"
bad,"Lack of clear direction and oversight of other influences with regard to initiatives and team interactions."
bad,"Company utilizes same resources for multiple product lines resulting in limited bandwidth and focus per project. "
bad,"Not a very stable job, management makes random decisions. you will be told the next day to join a different team and work on any random skill. No development or learning in Fiserv, the onshore team develops while offshore just maintains.Too much groupism and management has its favourites. no onsite opportunities at all (atleast for 5 yrs)"
bad,"The point system is terrible. Communication is terrible. Management is poor. Pay is not great. Burn out happens. You apply for other positions and they don't seem to higher from within very much. After a while, I was just done. There was no where else to go. Morale was getting worse and worse. Some co workers are great. Others can be rude. Its a place to work. Its a paycheck.. I guess."
bad,Since the time that I've been here people  come and go.. I feel that if they really LISTEN to the employees suggestions about some of the complaints from the cardholders.timeand time you hear the same thing. Looong wait times ....yet the company takes no action into listening  to the suggestions from cardholders and employees ... you just get people quitting and leaving.. the type of work that they demand can be very overwhelming.. and the bonus  system is getting  ridiculous .. they expect you to follow the scripting on some article that says how to do your job.. you do.. but you still get scored lower for saying it the way it's being scored  o .. and that is a qualifier  for the bonus... sooo somethings not right.  They just need to pay people more for the type of work that is expected.
bad,Resolve research Issue via email.  Work on projects as assigned and write procedures.  Within the group I work there is no advancement opportunities.
bad,Work along with my team to ensure we are working towards the same common goal.  Plunge in and give it all I got.
bad,"Inbound/outbound call center in card services dept.  I block customer’s cards that are lost and stolen.  I also assist in the Fraud prevention dept.  I calm customers down and make customers feel like they are well taken care of, and protected.  In this career I was also trained to take care of our ""High Profile"" clients, this job also consists of the following: placing travel settings on cardholders credit/debit cards, and filling out non-fraud dispute forms, along with fraud disputes, and affadivit forms to dispute charges on client's accounts."
bad,"The campus was over crowded, I had to share a conference room with others, and that was my work space.  Employees at companies acquired by FiServ unhappy to be there and contribute to any processes."
bad,Work here until you can find other employment. Not a good place to stay at.
bad,"Long hours, high expectations, no work-life balance - very political"
bad,"There is not much pressure of work, nothing as such to learn for a fresher."
bad,"Typical day at work is quite busy , i learnt a lot from my managers and colleagues , the growth opportunities are very few ,its v hard to progress , most enjoyable part of the job is cant think of anything 🧐"
bad,"There are many opportunities to learn, but the workload and pressure are overwhelming. Cooperation between departments varies widely and management does not address the workload and silo attitudes."
bad,"Management is either connected or short tenure, and HR will work to smother problems without double checking for responsibility. Feedback to agents on the floor is luck of the draw, hope your supervisor is articulate. Good money, weird incentives, and if your attendance is good you can stick for a while. Just be careful."
bad,"The benefits were the highlight of the job. When i was first hired at Fiserv it was a great place to work. Low stress, easy to be successful at the job and was a great pleasure doing the job. However with in the past year, new policies and procedure changes were made that made the position i had much more difficult to be able to reach and maintain the required service levels and goals asked of the employees. The environment became toxic and everyone in the department i worked in felt trapped, and set up for failure no matter what we did."
bad,Fiserv is a great company to use as a platform for personal development. It is important to focus on yourself because at the end of the day they will make decisions without considering their employees.
bad,"Jobs in development are not secure, due to outsourcing (India).  The pay is good, but your future is uncertain.  Customer-focused company, despite the culture and low morale."
bad,Company not bad but the senior workers and group lead talk to new workers like they are dumb and with no respect and management said nothing about it.
bad,"The pay is great and above average for the area. However, your work/life balance will be mostly work. If you state you are busy for a given time, even if you provided notice months in advance, management will pry into your personal schedule to see what extra hours they can squeeze out of you. This applies even after you have already put in 60 hours for the week.While you do receive PTO, do not expect to be able to take any."
bad,This company needs to do better in regards to management function and communication. This company prefers to conduct business in a dated manner inhibiting job performance.
bad,"Poor management and unrealistic sales goals will keep this company for achieving success.  New management does not understand banking, and impedes sales"
bad,"The benefits are nice including stock plan, 401k, supplemental life insurance, medical/vision/dental insurance. Monthly bonuses are no longer something you can cash in on, but starting pay increased to balance that. Sedgwick, the Leave of Absence company is absolutely garbage. You or a family member basically has to be terminally ill or completely bedridden for a claim to be approved. Mental health is not held with the same esteem that physical, provable ailments are. There are a lot of grey areas in procedures and rather than give leeway or wait to make a specific procedure go live until the grey is ironed out and fixed, they hold associates accountable for any misses accrued. Environment is fast paced and they would rather you meet AHT than focus on customer experience. At the same time, they have surveys that callers opt into, and if you don't provide that stellar service to get the max score of 5 (or even if you literally can't help with the callers problem), it's a coaching for you, eventually a performance plan. They start external hires out with more money than the people promoted from within and would rather hire externally for supervisor and up unless there is someone from internal that has played the game correctly in regards to the company politics or is in the favored list. The management team can't be trusted. If you don't have it in writing, pretend it wasn't promised, and even then, it might not be worth the server space or paper that's storing it. Perception holds more water than skill and ability."
bad,The everyday work presented nice challenges and opportunities for skills improvements and growth.  Most of the people were truly helpful and supportive.
bad,"The customer service part of the job is pretty easy and definitely rewarding to help a customer. What makes the work so tedious is the repetitiveness and constant mandatory overtime. There may be 3 months out of the year mandatory overtime is not required but during that time, management will harass the workers to take the offered overtime."
bad,Company focuses on stats and sees you as easily replaceable. No bonuses awarded for going above and beyond. No room for growth in the company. Constantly changing and making things worse.
bad,"Fiserv used to be a really fun place to work but not anymore.  Sub par leadership that get recycled from division to division, lack luster managers that have no clue on what it means to manage, lead or cultivate their employees and the high cost of benefits, this is no longer the place to work.  Being well liked vs. being able to do the job means being passed over for advancement opportunities.  High turnover rate with employees exist throughout the entire organization plus layoffs have impacted employee moral.  Do your research on this organization and their leadership before making a decision to work there."
bad,"Overall an ok-ok company, too much management driven , policies and hrs do not have significant role, work life balance is bit difficult,                                          very limited GPTW activities"
bad,"It is frustrating at times to work here. Generally, it is a good thing for departments to change. However, Fiserv needs to pick a direction and go. They are a vast company with so many different products I often wonder how they have competition at all. That said they try to be all things to everyone, which in the end hurts them as they don't develop features for specific markets deeply enough."
bad,Management does not relate with their direct reports.  There is no real opportunity to move up in the company.  The compensation is above average.  Flexible work arrangements was a plus.
bad,Many moving parts with poor internal communications. Survives from penetration in the financial market with few original products.
bad,"Sitting or Standing for 6-7 hours."
bad,"not very busy and a lot of just sitting. I got very bored at this job."
bad,"Good people work here but are really underpaid. The management makes and flaunts their high pay with expensive cars, lavish handbags, and boasting of indulgences; when associates struggle with being able to keep their heads above water."
bad,"The pay wasn't the best, co- workers were hard to get along with, management was stressed."
bad,No opportunity. No training program. No breaks. Frequent layoffs due to outsourcing to India. Aged and dying product line. Many employees lack basic social and customer service skills. Most enjoyable part of the job is 1 min before I leave for the day.
bad,"As a Technical Account Manager, the job consisted of providing Production Support to numerous FI's using Online Banking Software, requiring a 24/7/365 support plan. The job was extremely stressful when it came to managing and dealing with the large volume of high severity incidents, i.e. web site outages, feature malfunctions etc. Training was excellent, peers were fantastic, and management was spotty at best. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work itself, challenging, fun, and exciting cutting edge technology exposure. The hardest part was the thanklessness that was exhibited by some of the management. During my tenure, there was not one pay increase, whilst my responsibilities increased tenfold."
bad,-Complex org
bad,"There are some wonderful local managers, however many of the decisions are still made by off-site department managers that know nothing about the on-site work or processes involved. It is very frustrating."
bad,It could be a good place to work but Management does not give clear direction and the more you get promoted the less they teach you. The benefits are not worth it.
bad,The company is great thus far haven't explore  it much due to the recent changes with my previous company first data but as the new changes approaches everything seems adjustable
bad,"Fiserv has great benefits and competitive salary. "
bad,Opportunity to learn new skills but not many perks and poor leadership. Does not value employees as humans and people but as a number or a position that can filled if your life doesn’t revolve around them or if you are available at all times to drain yourself for the company. Same as most companies.
bad,"Before I started there, it seemed like they were very strict in their hurting process. Now, it's like if you can talk and type, you're hired. So in the years that I've been there, it's went down. No one abides by company policies at all. Hopefully it will get better. But if you don't mind these things, it'll be great for you. 😊"
bad,"Fiserv has amazing benefits and great pay, but their operations are not the best. Management and supervisors are not involved in the normal working environment, high stress, blatant favoritism and advancing is near impossible unless you are favored."
bad,Only good if want to work for one year. No growth opportunity role wise or hike wise. Onshore opportunity limited to existing people and Managers garbbing those first giving no room for a new employee to grow.
bad,I would not work for Fiserv again. They do not promote from within and their compensation is below average. They will lay off a full division without letting anyone know why or a transition period and taking some of the staff on for the transition. Despicable company to work for.
bad,"I HIGHLY recommend NOT to work here !! Pay is HORRIBLE and they just got bought by another company. The lending division. This is yr end review time, I WILL update after we have our 1 on 1's. Now it's time to see if your paid what you're worth. Will update after annual review."
bad,"My job was part of a purchase of assets by Fiserv, and at first things were fine.  As time moved on, though, it became obvious that they did not intend to move forward with those assets, and started letting people go as they were no longer needed.  That sort of behavior does not engender good feelings toward a company."
bad,"I worked for this company for 17 years and was let go. My group and our jobs where given to another Fiserv in Hickory, NC. I enjoyed the job while it was still CheckFree Corporation."
bad,"They are more focused on appearances than fixing the issues.  Their change schedules do not permit them to fix past mistakes or keep current with critical technologies.  Mid management seems to be looking up instead of down.  The place has more of a police state culture than one of enablement.  ""You will be fired"" seems to be a vocabulary staple there."
bad,"Did inventory ordered product wrote schedules for other associates. Did customer service, fitting room, cashiering."
bad,The company expects employees to know other jobs offered in the company without reasonable training in these other areas.
bad,"Good benefits and pay. "
bad,- poor management
bad,"Big company with many different businesses. The core business is strong, other outlying businesses dont get much attention. There is no formal on-boarding process which makes joining such a large organization very difficult."
bad,Good company to work for and a lot of growth potential. Dynamic people and culture. Compensation and benefits are fair across the different businesses
bad,Fiserv bangalore (bommanhalli office) is a good place to work if you are not career oriented & want to enjoy a government lifestyle & work. Managers & directors are highly incapable. Dont expect career growth or salary hike.
bad,"It seems that everything at FISERV is in need of improvement. From the basics of the technology and software at use to the people who use it. Many people there are as unreliable as the outdated software. Upper-management seemingly does not care about its workers. I've seen multiple FTE quit and get no exit interview or question why they are leaving except from co-workers and friends. In the building I work in most the people are good people, but in the main building it feels as if people look down their nose at you. Which makes people uncomfortable, which makes it hard to work at. As well the upper-management seems to not care about the happiness of its temporary associates and feigns empathy. At least, that is my perception. "
bad,"Work life balance was great, but no much direction from management. Hardly interacted with upper management. Was told training would be available and was not."
bad,"They are a big company with a high turn over rate of employees. Management could learn a thing or 2 about how to treat employees well. "
bad,"Working in a call center takes a special and certain type of person. I am not one of those. Also, being a call center that deals with people's money is even harder! Threats are made on your company and your own life. You are insulted, cussed at and yelled at every day by customers. Things are out of your control and is not your fault, but the customer makes you feel like it all is. It was the most challenging job I had."
bad,"Having experience as a data entry rep, this job was GREAT for me when it came to earning potential. "
bad,"Its a decent place to work. The most enjoyable part of the position would have to be my coworkers, there is a wide array of people and personality types."
bad,Contracted for conversion of Trust Accounting system from one platform to another after merger of multiple trust companies. Left after conversion was complete.
bad,nice people great benefits easy to access parking and location is close to amenities.  hiring more temporary employees and lost onsite human resources for employee support services less accessible than in the past
bad,Fiserv is one the fastest growing IT company which has been making profit in double figures since last 14 years. Since a long time it has taken over a lot of entities which used to be it's competitor.
bad,"The manager was knowledgeable but sometimes couldn't let go of their work. At times was unprofessional. The job was was dull and not very motivating."
bad,"•	Take inbound calls as the Consultant from those claimants who had submitted claims on any number of class action suits handled by Global City Group. "
bad,"Makes adjusting to change easier, which is always taking place. Supervisors are willing to help when needed to help along the way. Free drinks and good lobby."
bad,"dealing with mail on a day to day bases. Making sure the mail is ran and loaded onto the truck, so that the mails can be at the post office and out to the people ."
bad,Fiserv is a good place to work. Ive leard a lot working at fiserv. I've worked in different departments learning new things everyday
bad,"Not a good place to work so stay away. Bad Management, no growth opportunities. less pay, bad increments, a lot of office politics so stay away."
bad,not recommended at all money was is very bad and management bad as well there is no work shudlle what so ever it is a wast of time.
bad,"i'm a very industrious, dependable, flexible and dedicated team player who works well in groups or alone. i handle a great deal of duties from clerical to maintenance."
bad,Don't expect a pay raise or promotional opportunities unless you have been there for about 5 years
bad,"would be a great fit for someone who likes being tied to their desk and micro managaed. If I took a two minute run to the restroom my manager knew what time, how long and aksed where was I."
bad,Managing multiple projects from the business unit and provising production support of multiple platforms.
bad,"At the time that I worked at Fiserv they were running old mainframes that were grossly outdated to handle financial transactions.  They required constant manual maintenance in order to function properly as well as literally piles of backup tapes to be run every evening.  I worked second shift at the time and when I wasn't in training I was the only person there.  There wasn't a ton of room for advancement or growth nor was there a way to better learn and understand the technology they had in place.  The pay was ok for what it was, but the job was far too routine for my tastes."
bad,It was depressing working there but my co-workers were great. The division I worked for is not longer there.
bad,"very slow paced office, I need more action than I was having at this office, co-workers were very nice."
bad,The people within the organization are great to work with. I've learned a lot during my years at Fiserv.
bad,generate ETL scripts; use SSIS to do data transfer and use SSRS to create reports
bad,I've felt that the corporate level doesn't hold this branch in high regard.
bad,"The job isn't hard but the expectations for some departments to meet AHT and Adherence goals are ridiculous. Therefore, it is impossible to ever bonus."
bad,"I would come to work at 7 and work until 3:30. I got two breaks everyday, maybe three if I worked longer shifts. I would take at least 100 calls a day. So my average day could get quite exhausting."
bad,"Executive management runs everything without consideration as to what the local division needs. Stock price more important than product quality. Keep clients happy but don't fix the products. Moving more and more off shore, upper management got rid of the Enterprise Architecture Group saying ""Fiserv isn't mature enough to have architects"". Capability Maturity Model level zero fighting fires and trying to make up for automation flaws by using Service Now. Great talent in many of the people not being used."
good,"I learned a lot about IT Development and the payment processing landscape.  The new Alpharetta office was a great environment to work in, it was very high tech."
good,"The best way to describe a day at Fiserv would be it was a lot of ups and downs, laughing, crying, disappointments, and happy times at the same time"
good,really dont see yourself moving to a different or higher position poor management poor leads job slow always problems with machines that always mess up. they dont care about their workers pay is bad lunch is very short no breaks in between work time
good,"Started out as a good place to work, now its falling apart, they don't treat employees fairly, they expect the agents to ""do the right thing"" but yet they don't do right by the agents at times."
good,"its nice to work part time. the pay isn't great but it does pay the bills. the staff is super cool to work with.if you're good at ten key, this is the place for you."
good,Typical work day was very challenging and fast-paced. I learned many applications and received a stronger understanding of Infrastructure Documentation. Management began changing in organization (for better management strategies). Co-workers were varied and it was a challenge to be accepted by the group which consisted of 13 different backgrounds and personalities but I felt I accomplished this.  I enjoyed being able to assist in providing necessary documentation for turnover to IT Operations.
good,The company has been a productive and good place to work but we are merging with a larger company soon and our location may be downsized.
good,I did get the opportunity to learn and train on the IBM marketing cloud software. The culture was not friendly. my experience with management was not the best. But other managers seemed to be more engaged with their teams.
good,the seiners under estimate the new employees.They have very poor working culture and no job security. other than that; it is good size company with easy and clean environment
good,"Its a good place to work.But as for the girls concerned ,its nt much suitable as it takes time in resolving the user isssue.We have day by day target to complete the work."
good,"Using a slow computer program to verify leased vechicle documents and make sure 5 points on the contract were correct, if not had to change information using 'Tracs 2000' program.  The high of the day was opening mail for pay out and compiling them in a stack. Management was very close to rude each day, the co-workers made you feel unwelcome.  Most enjoyable part of the day was breaks and going home."
good,"I did outgoing returns, witch are checks being return to the first bank that had the item.I also ran a machine the encoded and seperated the various types of items in a batch.Then i would balance and find the outages, and post, and write up debits or credit if i wast out."
good,Management does not know what the staff is doing. Their sole focus is to squash the competition and that is shown in everything that they do. There are better places  to work.
good,Fiserv is known as a great company however that's what your trained to say instead of believing it.  Outsourcing jobs over seas and has only recently started to have competitive wages
good,"Although I have enjoyed working for Fiserv,  management seems to have tunnel vision and employees are pigeon holed so it becomes difficult to transfer into other divisions.  Management doesnt even seem to know what their teams qualifications or education they have ."
good,At first it was a great place to work but now it’s not. The managers don’t know what is going on half the time and they will write you up for anything
good,"Very stressful place to work, Upper Management had no clue on how to help the culture and make the Job better.   enjoyed my coworkers and my direct managers.  Its said that all of my direct managers quit due to upper management lack of respect for their skills and employee engagement"
good,"very little respect for the job and the quality brought to the job, poor and lacking management skills of the dept manager"
good,"Solid stable company, can work from home a couple of days a week. Compensation was fine for fresh out of college, but yearly you get 1 to 2% raises, which after 4 years, I don't make enough to pay student loans and even afford my own apartment. I should be making 10-20K more, easily by this point."
good,"Fiserv est une entreorise dirigée par des financiers, des contraintes draconiennes sont mises en place concernant les coûts y compris les coûts concernant la formation de ces employés."
good,"If Fiserv leadership teams avoided preferential treatment when promoting internal talent and focused on promotion based on talent and performance, vendors, partners and external clients would experience a more productive and collaborate project | program delivery experience."
good,"Great work/life balance and benefits"
good,Don't expect to be paid a fair salary for your experience or credentials. They also have too many layoffs so morale is low and employees only work hard enough to not get fired.
good,"The people I work with are amazing however management wants you to fit in a specific mould. "
good,"I have mix feeling about this company Robert half located in Omaha, NE I absolutely loved I was with them for 2 Years I kept a steady position and if there were a problem they would do their best to resolve it in the most professional way and still find me another position if I was not happy at the current position now as far as Robert Half located in Des Moines, IA is a terrible company by all aspects."
good,Each day we would come in and wait for a batch of checks and deposits from different banks and key in certain numbers on a 10-key machine. I learned how to use a 10-key machine. My co-workers are good people. I only got to know some of them. The hardest part of the job was waiting a batch of work to be delivered to complete. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing our batches of work at a timely matter.
good,Dedicated team.
good,"Fiserv lacks a clear vision and direction from upper management, which shows up at the employee elevel with unclear goals, lack of direction and no attention to employee development or advancement"
good,"When i first started i was very much into improvement, but as i started along the way i find myself very stressed. Overworked and underpayed for what i do. Management tend to take sides and my job title is nothing like what i am doing. I have a stern tongue and tend to say what's on my mind. In saying that i tend to clash w/certain people because i say what i believe in and there is an employee that i do not work well with. I am never like that because i believe in teamwork. I don't believe that most people believe in that. Although they do help in times of need but somedays is way too relaxed where i find unfair to me. Too much gossiping and people are always talking about other people's issue, not keeping things private enough."
good,"Days are filled with meetings leaving little time for actual work. As such, to accomplish the work tasks in your pipeline you are up all night doing real work. There is an occasional comp day here and there, but be prepared to get very little sleep for your first few years there."
good,The workplace was full of drama managers had less experience than the workers. Lots of love triangles and unprofessional relationships. You could work there for over two years and someone new would make buddy with a manager and they'd get a raise before you.
good,"For any contest or fun activity, managers enjoyed because employees were on a strict schedule. Some employees hnew how to manipulate the system. Different departments should have different pay structure, especially those most stressful and dealing direct with customer. Salary example below is a joke for the average worker ."
good,Good pay but stressful environment due to management. No time for family. Co-workers are a pleasure to work with. They have a cafeteria on site that is pretty expensive not really worth buying the food.
good,This would be a great place to work if they knew what they were doing. Managers hardly know anything. Unfortunately they laid off all the managers and employees for the contact center.
good,"Bad management, not organized. Not many opportunities for minorities to grow. Lost too many big clients due to disorganization. Managers are lost and dont even know their work."
good,"*Management needs training in the ability to relate to others better"
good,contractor for a short time.  Training manuals not updated to reflect new system.  Manager had favorites. Did not like new office setup.  Some of the older employees have been with the company for 20+ years.  Culture was decent for regular full time employees.
good,"They are beginning to allow a culture of violent speech and ""mock"" or ""play"" violence among employees and supervisors. This is a very slippery slope between allowing horse play and allowing a culture of violence to take root. I became very uncomfortable there and left as a result of this blossoming culture."
good,Nice place to work but no there is no room for advancement in Chicago.  If you are willing to relocate to advance your career Fiserv is a good company to work for.
good,"Job is not difficult to learn.  Must be patient with irate customers."
good,"Management is extremely inconsistent in both processes and department standards which creates an unstable working environment!  Would not recommend my current department to a friend, not sure about the company overall as I do not interact with too many other groups."
good,There is no room to grow. Minimal management support. Pay increase was stingy. No real culture. Excellent place to work if you don't mind expanding your work without compensation with no training. There is also no job security with constant centralization and work reduction along with jobs being sent overseas.
good,"Overall Fiserv is a good company, however a few of the divisions are very bottom line oriented and thus treat their employees like nothing more then minions. Several layoffs to hit numbers."
good,"Was happy working for the company and I had planned to retire with the company. But after 15 loyal years of service, I lost my job because company moving software development to India"
good,"Excellent opportunities to learn and practice skills that could better utilized elsewhere."
good,"work never ends, and no breaks at all.. can't take long week break, month leave. bad. management puts too much pressure."
good,"Learn how to operate machine, focus on details and quality of the output."
good,"A typical day at Fiserv for me includes answering phone calls, directing couriers, customer service, Microsoft outlook, data entry using Excel, operating machinery, filing, faxing, Sending out mail, maintaining a clean and tidy work area."
good,"After the buy out, my job responsibilities remained the same.  Working on the phone with several banks and the online banking systems."
good,Took inbound calls from customers who needed assistance with on-line bill pay and collected funds.
good,longer hours.
good,"Friendly environment, call center setting. Management of files with the different banks that we help key and balance. I learned alot about the different rules with dealin with banks and customer service. The enjoyable is larning the different concepts of the banking rules."
good,"I can work up to 60 hours a week.  I do not even feel like I have time to take a shower. I am a corporate level employee, but the office I am at is ALL call center. There are no other corporate level employees located here."
good,"Pros: They pay good, great benefits, good people (kind of), good atmosphere, great coffee and break area. "
good,Fiserv recently completed the government process for merging with First Data. Things are currently extremely unstable as jobs are compared and merged.
good,"Fairly typical call center position.  The work it self is not the problem nor is the amount being payed as it is fair however the management is not great.  They make it clear in every way that they do not care about you as a person, you are property not a person."
good,"Loved the job. My goals were hit 100% for metrics. A polar vortex storm hit, in my area we got 4 feet of snow, location of my job got a dusting. I couldnt leave my house for 3 days, was in constant contact with my manager, took pictures etc. Came back to work on that Friday, worked my entire shift and was let go. Another shoddy company with cliques and asskissers. I prefer to work to contribute to growth."
good,"The pay is not enough for the stress. Differential pay is not what they say it is. Management doesn't care and all employees are expendable unless you do whatever they say without question even if they're wrong. They have no problem in mass firing people and then hiring like 50 new people and doing it all over again. They say there's job advancement but with the impossible metrics to meet and without knowing someone on the inside, it's impossible.."
good,"I work remotely which is nice but the products that you are trying to debug and fix was coded over 10+ years ago. I am tasked to fix these issues as a UI/UX expert but the management gives unrealistic deadlines to do so and was very hesitant on giving proper training to understand the product. They also felt that the UI/UX software I was using wasn't needed, so I am to make do and rely on the client to give me proper images/files which can delay a project 2 weeks."
good,"We were working on keeping alive a legacy system, year after year they reduced staff while expecting more work and features on the system.  However, the company keeps growing due to this cuts and hard work by the employees, and this is not enjoyed by the employees.   Many employees are going for years without proper vacations, and while not on-call it is very common to not being able to enjoy holidays neither. "
good,The work was always the same balance banks  entry of checks . Management was not around so the employees some of them did what ever they wanted to do The pay was very low
good,"Good people.  The amenities are nice. Many of the associates work from home which can be a nice perk. Just like any organization, there are few doing the work of many and many that you can't tell what they do. Don't mind working there but I would not recommend to a friend."
good,"The job it self is not difficult and tolerable. The management is what ruins the location, they do not know what there doing most of the time and when changes are made to daily process they are as lost as the associates who has the questions."
good,"The staffs and culture is very diverse and everyone respects and work as team players to get the work done."
good,"The job itself was great. It's data entry processing information from either scanned or physical documents. Problem is, the company (at least at the Chicago, IL location) employs mostly annoying, ghetto super loud women. Not a good environment if you're someone who just wants to come to work and mind your own business. But if you have the right personality to fit in with this group, then it's easy money"
good,"Open concept work environment. Good work life balance. Friendly people, good location for shopping, living and straight shot to the city of Atlanta. Good place to work."
good,my imression is that they are not organized and management is not supportive to what is best for employees that are best fit for them and work hard for them.  The HR department forms bias opinions and are not fairand imparttial as well as their collaborative processes.
good,"The company doesn't care about the little people. Feels like you're always walking on glass. Management always says that there's room for advancing in the company, then says there's no funding behind it."
good,Not a bad corporation to work for. High stress and acceptable wages. At least the employees are usually sociable and work is usually left at home. That's a plus.
good,Not too bad. It was a long time ago so I am not sure I can speak to how they are now.  Didn't see much room for advancement then.  But I do know a few former coworkers who are still with them and they are doing well.
good,"Pay is average to below, health benefits are high, company policy is to give salary increases to no more than 50% of the employees any given year, average 2.7% - every *other* year...along with the health insurance increases, you can't keep up with inflation like that."
good,"1. There I am feeling good while doing product. Because there some area of BPO,"
good,"Day to day, was good.  My job as Title searcher II was repetitious.  I enjoyed my job.  The hardest part of the job, was my immediate manager."
good,The analytic team was not much valued in this company (Dublin OH office). The management was not efficient and capable.
good,"I believe I am better suited to work in an organization that has a strong commitment to mentoring and developing executives, where there is a strong sense of loyalty on both sides and a culture that fosters career development and growth"
good,"Training is horrible and management is Below average, advancement and growth not available till been there a year. Micromanaged is best described for this company"
good,Project Completed. Delivered. In Time. On Schedule. No scope Creep. Closed. Looking for next project. Domestic division is an amazing place to work for.
good,"a typical day is answering calls, working with banking information and payments. co workers constantly trying to make the best of every day"
good,"The management here was not a good thing to deal with. In Arizona, there are very few positions available to move among. The job gets to be extremely redundant, quickly, and they will not work with you easily on schedules. There is a lot of hypocrisy and misinformation."
good,Flexible hours are convenient and there is an opportunity to learn and wear many different hats. Telecommuting is a nice perk
good,Willing to learn new tasks within this office ; but was outsourced from a Termporary Agency . Would like to work full-time if given a fair chance to learn other areas within my skillset. thanks.
good,Fiserv doesn't care about anything but the bottom line.  People don't matter.
good,"Good collection of products. However, the employees are not trained on using them. They are normally thrown into the fire with no knowledge of the product they are working with. Management is poor and layoffs are ever too often."
good,I love making the clients happy with my work.
good,"They are very non compromising, all they care about is the call volume, they don't care if you are about to die they still want you to come to work and work a 55 hour week because they always have mandatory overtime"
good,The Shoreview location is like being part of family.  There are staff who have been there for 40+ years.  There is continuity because there is a lot of staff who have been there a long time and are willing to help out coworkers.
good,"Fiserv has excellent ecommerce payment processing tools. They have full support for ecommerce, including telecheck, gift cards, fraud detect, currency converters, and off course they support all major credit cards."
good,"I was with Fiserv for over 12 years.  The company sells products without full support on the back end which leads to escalations and poor client experience.  Technical and talent resource acquisitions are extremely uneven throughout various teams - the teams in critical need do not garner management attention and it is incredibly difficult to get the required resources.  Only after the situation worsens are resources allocated (if you're lucky).  Other departments are able to frequently increase their workforce proactively.  Work/life balance is non-existent, and impact to associate moral and stress levels are ignored.  Fiserv touts associate wellness as a priority, but does not acknowledge the detrimental effect their actions and workloads have on their associates health."
good,"- In addition to normal Data Center operations, a typical day included resolving hardware issues to continue custom application production processing."
good,The PMO was great to work with. Newer managers from corporate were great to work with and challenging so the PM position was never boring. Remote was a great beni.
good,Took a lot of calls and just followed directions on how Fiserv wanted me to answer. It was easy to answer questions and interact with customers.  Overall it was easy with my experience as a customer rep.
good,"As of the last couple of years there has been considerable turnover in upper management, the current team believes working in excess of 50 hours has become the norm.  The streamlining of staffing has made it difficult to provide good service to clients. Although employees are surveyed annually they do not seem to listen."
good,Starts out great but after you perform well at one task they give 3 more.  If you succeed at those tasks you will get even more & expect you to still perform all given tasks regardless of the hours that you work per week.
good,"NOV 2014 – AUG 2017"
good,"Changes in management can result in changes in previous agreements made. Realize that you can be loyal to a company, but circumstances change and in the end that loyalty may not be returned."
good,"Notorious for being stingy with raises and cost of living increases, but a decent place to work. Negotiate your pay well up front; its hard for managers to secure raises for their staff."
good,"The people I worked with great, that even includes some of the Mid-management.  But I was informed by Contract Recruiter, that I would be hired in on a permanent basis.  Then within less that a week's time, my recruiter calls me and let's me know that Fiserv decided to end my contract status.  So, it's questions of the bottom line with this company, not about helping people."
good,I did not like working their and the pay was low . Tjhey did provide lunch with a nice salad bar for a low cost cost which kept you from having to drive some where every day
good,"Relaxed environment, desks are not clean and the management needs more coordination, in addition to that there is no value for the employee's opinion. in other words if you don't like something you can leave."
good,"A typical day included working banking services for a variety of banks and credit unions for primarily inbound callers. In addition the role includes the handling and resolution of escalated calls, and providing coaching feedback to any/all associates. The workplace culture is fairly quiet and mellow to help balance the stressful nature of the calls."
good,Production coordinator ordering materials to execute jobs in a timely manner. Coordination between shifts and departments can become tricky. Improvement in communication among coordinators and management is needed. Fast-paced environment with strict time constraints and high levels of confidentiality. Transitions between shifts and coordinators needs improvement.
good,"Starting pay is low compared to other manufacturing companies in the same area and your raises, few and far between as they are, are of the nickel and dime variety. You might get a quarter if you're lucky. Also, expect very long hours and Saturdays, which is fine if you love overtime and don't value family time or have a home life. The work, however, is easy, the atmosphere is laid back, and the co-workers are some of the best I've ever had."
good,Not the worst place to work. It's a typical phone job. Management changes a lot. People come and go a lot because they do quarterly schedule changes and pit employees against each other for the better schedules.
good,"Work life here is very tight-knit and functions like a family (including the managers closest to you).  I've made plenty of friends in an area that I had little connection to in a short period of time. The environment (at least in my location) is fairly relaxed and I feel like I can easily talk to the person I directly report to.  Now my bosses bosses (ehhhh.....)"
good,constant management changes.  Losing culture as they employ outsiders to corporate positions.  Benefits have been lost over the last 8 years.  They don't like to help keep their employees trained on the latest technology.
good,"It was fun for a limited time. They gave me no notice when they let me go. I actually came in on a Saturday for them (not typical) and couldn't log in, that's how I found out ""they didn't need me anymore"""
good,politics play very important role in fiserv. senior management encourages people to be recruited from certain place from where he belongs to. Low stress at work place is most enjoyable part of the job.
good,It was a good place to work at when I first started.  As time went on it became  a not so good place to work.  This happened when management changed.  At one time it felt like  one big family
good,"It was a great company to work for lmost 23 years but they tend to lay off people at a moments notice.  No real reason except ""Corporate Restructuring"".  Instead of letting you know so you can apply for another position within the company, they lay you off and tell you that you can re-apply for positions within the company. While this happens, they maintain off shore personnel."
good,I had been working here for over three years now. Management is not cognizant of the hard work you put. There is no appreciation or recognition by the management. Poor work -life balance.
good,"good company to work for but mgmt puts a ton of pressure on you to work overtime."
good,"Lease Consultant-being yelled at by phoning in customers and expect to deflate the issue without paying to be a real counselor. If you are good on the phone, management will not let you advance. A job people end up trapped in. Uses employees in lower paying jobs to clean up messes of employees in higher paying jobs. "
good,"All work to be completed in strict time frame. I Learnt how to operate in a varying work force, a thorough understanding of work flow and the ability to manage a large team with varying needs. To work with differing business cultures and other Teams all vital to the completion of each days processing requirements. "
good,"A typical day at Fiserv would be logging into the PC sorting out your open cases to either research or following up with clients. Checking on any new cases assigned to you. "
good,"Good Employee engagement policies."
good,"This company is very top heavy with little focus on lower level employees.  With several acquisitions, each business unit/location operates like a totally different company.  There is a high turnover rate because of the culture."
good,"The company is doing its best to try and have a strong and work balance for its employees.  Company culture is evolving and changing, change can be positive and productive."
good,Friendly people if you can find time to get to know anyone. Very micromanaged and expected not to ever miss any days off. Hard to track down management when you have a question or concern and no refreshers on any training issues you may not have understood the first time around.
good,"Looking for challenging openings in System Engineering and further broadening my knowledge in accordance with the latest trends utilizing all my skills fully and contributing to the associated organization towards its progress, to satisfy both individual and organizational requirements."
good,"I guess that I should expect this from any company but I have been 3 yrs and other people are getting hired on making more than me.  Also, some rules apply to 1 person but does not necessarily apply to another person."
good,Regressive work culture.  Poorly managed from the top down.
good,"I liked working for this comapany, since I have been there they hve downsized three times. I feel that this particular facility is in need of better management for them to survive. I liked everyone I worked with and I loved my clients and had a great relationship with them. I hope that the Indianapolis facility can become stronger."
good,love the people and the job. Just no room for advancement and I would rather work in rogers. Closer to my husband
good,"I really enjoy the staff I work with and the ‘role’ I play in the company. But this company is so locked down with red tape that after a year there I feel I was only capable of completing 20% of what I would have anticipated in other settings. For me this is frustrating and a major reason many people have short stints of employment. "
good,Co- workers are very helpful
good,Not such a great place to be. Lot of politics involved. Too stingy when it comes to spending money on resources' well being.
good,Well I did learn a lot at Fiserv. How to be a team player.
good,I loved the people. Too many leaders giving vague direction. No outlined job specifics.
good,There is no technically growth in this company  people are getting excess salaries as compare to there work no Management responsibility no salary benefits no bonus
good,"Need more focus on technical and domain knowledge. The company is losing lot of senior folks with good domain knowledge, which is impacting the quality of deliverable. Associates with personal contacts are rewarded more than the deserving one's."
good,company is too large to be efficient.  they force you to do your own i.t. work.  there's no human resources person on site.  there's no clear direction from anyone on how to do anything.
good,Did not feel able to make decisions and recommendations in my role. Some leadership difficult to deal with. Feel as though my voice was not heard. Was able to work remotely.
good,Was a good place to develop and stretch....not sure about that now.  Gauge the type of work life you'll have through your interview experience.  If it feels disengaged...that may gave you insight to what lies ahead.
good,"Fiserv is a good company overall, but some parts of the company are more stressful than others.  There are many good and intelligent people at the company, but annual revenue targets are unrealistic, creating a tense work environment."
good,"If you are on the software services side of the company, there is no work-life balance. Some programmers are really good and others dont know what they're doing. So good ones end up carrying the load for the team. Salary is lower than the other companies in the metro area"
good,"Good perks at start, but slowly were ended when sold to Fiserv.  Once used training on different platforms to determine salary, the more you learn, the more you earn.  Changed to required learning multiple platforms and constantly changing which platforms were worked, which lessoned mastery of position."
good,I really enjoy working at Pfizer I made a lot of new friends it was a fun place to work we had a lot of different parties we helped each other we helped each other financially overall size or was a good place to work management was just horrible
good,"A typical day of work includes working on sprint items and prioritizing the production issues reported by customers as well as Clients. Feature Releases happen on a quarterly basis but there are other type of releases(emergency,client integration) happen between the quartely releases."
good,It was a cool job until I was always being harrassed after i was offered a new position. It made me not want to come to work. The pay was good but it wasnt worth coming to work to ruin your day.
good,"People are nice and helpful, too many meeting and not enough time to do the job. Miss managed. No monetary rewards. Salary never increases compare to market. Very few employees in US."
good,"it was very stressful "
good,"OK place to work. Mostly nice people. "
good,"As a supervisor, I have seen three of my peers leave the environment over the past year. All were due to a lack of respect and development from the manager. We have recently been expected to work additional hours, but never provided notice of when we will need the additional time. There is little to no communication from the manager, and it is almost never positive."
good,Fiserv EFT was an exciting place to work.  It was fast paced and there was never a dull moment.  Had room for career advancement.  Plenty of learning experiences along the way
good,Needed better equipment to do the job better. we had daily deadlines to meet and making sure that when the couriers came to pick up their work on time.
good,"Worked with data and morgages. "
good,"While the work was great, the lack of benefits detracted from it. Management was very much a good old boys club that prevented advancement. I did enjoy the responsibilities."
good,Work life involves long days. I can be fun with the right group. The company itself believes in the bottomline and will do anything to increase profits
good,"Fiserv has good Management . You cannot expect aggressive growth, but good job security coupled with slow paced growth option makes Fiserv a decent place to work"
good,"i do not have a comment at this time. every individual will not have the same experiences, as each person is different and treated as such. apply if you like, don't apply if you don't like"
good,"I have held many different positions at Fiserv. The company has good benefits including health, 401k match and employee stock plan. The downside is that the raises were little to non-existent."
good,"Fiserv is attempting to be ""everything to everybody"" and there's good and bad to that. They are a money-maker and the compensation is good. There's job security. However, the work-life balance is poor and it seemed to me the past year I was there management lacked focus, reactionary environment prevailed and seemed to be little or no talk of a strategy. If you are prepared for 12 hour days, six maybe seven days a week and travel then Fiserv might have an opportunity. If your plans for a work-week are not so ambitious I'd keep looking,"
good,"There was a problem estimating and selling projects without involving the appropriate people.  When I left, they were addressing the issue and may not still have the issue."
good,I worked for this company for a little over 2 years.  little opportunity for advancement based on performance. limited wage increase.  poor benefits package
good,A lot of changes but nothing new and innovative.  The company needs to catch up with present day business practices. It's not all what it's cracked up to be.
good,"Well not to be funny but their point system is a joke, management doesnt want to work with you, who ever heard of being counted against for going into surgery to have a gallbladder removed?! A point for every hour missed, its ridiculous. Im not happy with this place...."
good,"Easily laid off, but over all a good company with decent pay.Ability to work at your leisure, but make sure your work gets done. Coworkers are great. Frequent travel is difficult at times."
good,I have learned a lot in my position. I have multitasked and contributed to various project which has exposed me into different areas of business
good,"Fiserv is a global company that is constantly expanding, so there are lots of opportunities to grow and expand your career. Most of the leadership has an open door policy and welcome anyone to come in and talk to them about anything. "
good,"I was here for 6 years and they hired foreign replacements, that I had to train, to take my job.  They do not care about the employees, just the bottom line."
good,Your coworkers will be some of the best people in the business however the grapevine data center has gone to multiple ownership and is in the continual process of staff reductions and movement of all operations to other locations.
good,"This position held the responsibility of processing claims within the employer groups assigned along with taking calls from members, employers, and providers to check on claims, eligibility and benefit details."
good,"1. Learnt new technology - MVC 4"
good,"Lot of learnings at my plce, however politics is the hardest thing."
good,Theres not really room to grow with this company people have been there for 10 and 20 years and not making much more than new employees. Hardest part of the job are the long hours especially during month  end where you can work anywhere from 8-12 hours a day and up to seven days a week. And even at that time the only break you get in your 30 lunch break 
good,"Fiserv has an impressive number of products and services they offer in the Financial Services industry.  There are some frustrations with getting thing done on a daily basis, but overall there is good amount of focus on providing our clients with the best service.  I have learned an immense amount from my management team and coworkers at Fiserv.  There is a great focus on learning and improving our knowledge base.  "
good,Fiserv is a 6 Yrs old organisation at established at Noda and now at pune and bangalore also. Very good organisation to work and learn for first timer . Management is supportive most of the times. Employees enjoy working at Fiserv.
good,Pros- lots of work for a hard working person. Fair amount of starting vacation days. Several additional benefits that are optional.
good,Project Management:
good,"There's weeks when you work a lot of works and make overtime, while the following weeks you will make between 20-25 hrs and that ""fulltime"" They also promise more hours but when the time comes they either send you home early, or text you to take the day off. As if you want to take a day off, at times. Also the coordinators favorite certain workers based on there friendship so they over see a lot of workers slacking off."
good,Hard working employees and a very friendly client base. Training for workplace was very efficient.
good,Early am hours to punch the time clock on the dot normally. Handled plastic cards and ran the machines to imprint graphics on them. Learned how to work fast and run a process. Fix mistakes made by myself and learn from them as well. Management wasn't always fair with delegating hours and desired shifts or times off due to family members working there of management. Hardest part of job was standing on concrete all day running around getting the cards processed and inspected. Best part of the job was knowing I was making good money for the age I was at and knowing I was going to be able to have money to do what I wanted financially.
good,"The salary and the incentives were OK, but they did not give a full-time position for pay not the benefits."
good,I like the atmosphere within the departments I worked. I really enjoyed most of the people I worked with. Some has really good work ethic while others didn't. Compensation can always be better for this day and age and the work load we receive.
good,"There are good benefits and a fun culture but your role and work load is entirely dependent on the department you work with. Some groups never seemed to be busy while others, like my own, were constantly taking calls and had little down time. The company is way too focused on numbers and impressing their shareholders to care about employee satisfaction and stress management."
good,Great place to work with tremendous opportunity for initiative and advancement. Great people and great culture. Would recommend to a friend interested in working in FinTech.
good,"Traveled frequently, high demands from management, managers not caring about family life or if you have medical issues they do not know how to handle the situation. Management needs training on medical issues that arise with employees. When I returned to work from Ltd my manager had no concern of my health only concern was making himself look good. I feel as though I was forced into leaving a job that I truly enjoyed."
good,"good work life balance. typical services based organization even though management claims it to be a product based organization, which is not the case"
good,Excellent growth opportunity for Sourcing Managers. Company provided presentations on the technical aspects of Sourcing. There training teamwork efforts.
good,"communication is lacking"
good,Fiserv pays very well but it's resource to workload ratio is very high. A great deal of work is expected which can lead to a rapid burnout. Network Standards are very rigid and new network technology is adopted at a very slow rate.
good,"Great people around you but management is 'now you see them, now you don't' when needed.Some amazing managers that are a pleasure to work with! Wonderful attitude!"
good,"Fiserv believes in innovation. The company tries to be that way to customers but not employees.  The internal systems need a lot of work."
good,"Good experience working with the second biggest IT Service Company. Good working culture beside it is a policy centric organisation. "
good,"I got oppertunity to work remotey 100%.And able to build ,support and maintenance the system 24 hrs.we had ample time to work flexible hour and able to have workcom hours if we have family emergency.Company building new service and transition to serve the client and maintenance system makes easy and smooth in the future."
good,"Fiserve is now United Healtcare.  My typical day was taking inbound calls, from the Fiserve customer about an unpaid claim.  All types of calls , challenging but rewarding"
good,"Fiserv has a really nice office in Alpharetta GA, featuring a cafeteria, gym, covered parking, car wash service, bicycles to borrow, and lots of niches where you can escape if you need a few minutes of personal space.  If really is a beautiful facility and a nice place to work."
good,"Difficult to work across teams and departments as everything has become very silo'd."
good,Fiserv is a relaxed job to a sense where you have your own space and you take calls and keep to yourself. I was put on a team and it is my duty to do my part to make sure my team is successful. The job can get boring because it is mainly sitting all day and just taking phone calls.
good,"a typical day at work is basically sitting at an 8 hour shift taking calls the entire time. the workplace culture is really nice. the hardest part of the job is the mandatory OT we have every 1st and 3rd of the month. Even though I believe this environment isn't the best due to poor management and continuous changes, I have learned quite a few things here to improve my customer service and computer skills"
good,"A very busy day answering phone calls at Fiserv.  I've learned to configure and troubleshoot routers and firewalls.  Also, I configured switches and installed Dell servers at customer site."
good,"A high production office.  Lots of time measurements and quality controls.  Not a fun place to work and very little possibility for promotion. Every thing was fast paused"
good,"It is a very high volume call center environment. The hardest part of the job is maintaining all of the security procedures when accessing client accounts, and dealing with frustrated clientele."
good,I was Very happy with my job at Fierv but they moved my position out of state which caused me to lose my job! I believe I would have stayed there until retirement had they not moved!
good,"In my current role a typical day starts with answering emails, calls, instant messages, and assigned tickets from clients, colleagues, and various support partners."
good,"They wont people who works as slaves not putting any questions and do what ever they asked."
good,"As it appears to be the case in every big company today, outsourcing continues to grow and with that we are seeing experience and expertise go down. Restructuring seems to address not how to improve process and organization efficiency but how to reduce salary expenses regardless of what this means to the overall productivity. The most enjoyable part of the job is sharing ideas and working together with the people you've known for years and because of that, you know they have your back and you have theirs. The hardest part of the job is the growing lack of communication between levels. It appears as though management no longer follows or is not getting a full view of what's being done by the people in the front lines or even worse, how hard these people are working and the sacrifices they are having to make to keep up with the work..."
good,I always received very favorable reviews and raises. I'm not a disgruntled ex employee. Everyone there always talked about how great it use to be there. Downsizing is always difficult.
good,"It was really busy working there.  Because of the industry they are in, job security is not that great.  You kind of feel like you are walking on eggshells."
good,"A good company to work.Work life is relaxing, work life balance is also good, teams are good and friendly and you make good friends out of colleagues."
good,"we would key routing and account numbers on checks, balance them if any out of balances, send reports to the federal reserve, called the banks if there was anything missing checks or piggybacks. i learned 10 key, typing, how to use the phone, learned good customer service, how to handle a situation when one would arise. got along great with my co-worker's."
good,Fiserv has high job security but slow career growth. It is the work place where you can get good time to manage your person responsibility.
good,"Unfortunately too much office politics, that prevented and deterred performance of skilled employees in favor of favored individuals who only catered to management without preforming at the level of expectations required by protocols,"
good,"Pros"
good,"Decent work place with good benefits. Not the type  of job you want to be if you want growth and leadership with in the company. I am under appreciated ,under worked & under paid.There is a new hire each month because of the poor quality company.But there is a  decent amount of hours each each. The most enjoyable part is working alongside co workers. We really work great as a team but doesn't get noticed for hard work. But a job is a job and it gets the bills paid"
good,Health benefits not great for such a big company especially if you have a family. Good work life balance. Little advancement opportunities.
good,"This company is having cool work life, however management is bit tough to handle. HR work is not upto the mark. I did not find best leaders in this organization."
good,"A typical day at work was very stressful, although I learned quite a bit in my time there. The hardest part of my job was having so many duties & no help if/when I asked. I enjoyed my co-workers &  knowing that I made a difference in the work place daily. No work/life balance. Management use to pride their employees. Limited communication between employees & management unless it benefits management."
good,"Good work life balance but growth is limited."
good,There is a lot of processes involved in getting Technical Support items done.  Management tends to be over your head with some information and kept tight to the chest with other information.  IT Support tools are out dated and no movement from Management in getting better tools.
good,More and more responsibilities but no recognition.  Tension within the team and with other teams was apparent.
good,"Tends to be data processing oriented  with a strong focus on near term ROI.  Is in process of adopting a more strategic view towards data,  data monetization,  analytics and decesion making."
good,okay type .. i dont want to comment as the process i was working for was taken back in 10 months.
good,"Provided over the phone technical support to management personnel for banks and credit unions.  This was a new line of business for me to learn and it was quite interesting learning how credit and debit cards work behind the scenes.  Management was demanding of staff which was understandable, but often times did not show appreciation to its employees for their efforts.  The hardest part of the job was learning a new system and then being able to help clients in real time when their customers were waiting for an immediate result to any problems they may have been experiencing with their credit/debit card. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was chosen to handle the start of the credit side of the business and having to travel to different states to learn how they used the system.  It was challenging, a lot of work but overall one of the most fun projects I have worked on throughout my career."
good,This company is ok to work for. It's just not a match for me anymore.
good,"no annual raises base on performace, goals are hard to reach"
good,My typical shift was the night shift. A shift that was relaxed and offered you a chance to learn things slowly with attention to details. I worked with a great bunch of people who were like family. I enjoyed this job but as time progressed with new owners it failed to meet my needs and conflict with new shift requirements made it difficult.
good,"* Stable work environment"
good,I have learned Agile and good QTP automation in this compnay. Fiserv is overall an average company
good,"Fun, friendly, and productive workplace. I worked in the presort department dealing with mail before it was to be sent off to the USPS. A typical day a work would involve operating a NPI machine which sorts mail to a specific bin according to the zipcode. Also you could be on the machine catching mail, or in distro packaging trays of mail putting them on skids. Management was ok. I have to say though, being able to have fun and joke around but at the same time be productive is what I enjoyed most. Adapting to the constant changes shift in and shift out was the hardest part of the job but hey its a business. You could be told something one minute and 20 minutes later it could something different. Overall i gave this job a 3.5/5"
good,"It no longer was! Rules that were inplace for 25 years about how disciplinary actions was to take place, were gone? HR was no help to the employees."
good,"Alot of the manager are very nice to with and for,alot of them are very understanding and helpful."
good,"pretty good company to work for, in my position there is a lack of advancement"
good,This job is not the best but management and employees make it reasonable. Management makes sure you're trained however they have a bit of micro managing
good,I am unable to give a true opinion on what I feel of my current employer as we just recently merger with Fiserv. I rated the company a 3 because that is a fairly neutral score that reflects the little I know about this company.
good,"A typical day at work: I was assigned about 30 credit reviews in need execution of risk model, business models, analysis of financial statements, and I was the person in charge to make a decision of approving the account based on value vs. risk"
good,"Good work/life balance"
good,"I learned how to edit like a pro. Expanded my writing skills. Fiserv was a wonderful stepping stone to owning my own writing, editing and website design company."
good,"Extremely segmented network environment with a lot of red tape and inaccurate information given for most work requests/projects. A lot of good people work there, but as a network engineer a lot of time is wasted in meetings and hunting down simple/correct information that should have been provided from the beginning. "
good,"work environment is average due to facility being subpar and nothing exciting or fun for the workers. "
good,Its good if you are just starting out at a job. I enjoyed the job for a while and it is a good way to start out but wouldnt recommend for a long term career
good,"8 hours or more "
good,Multiple different departments so can only speak for where I work and it's about average. Sup is nice. Expectations are a little all over the place and not exactly set in stone or even in any kind of policy or procedure.
good,"There are options to advance, but no discussions really regarding career pathing. The job I currently am in was great and we could actually complete our job functions versus now where the volume has increased."
good,"Overall a good company with basic benefits. Depending on work area, it can be very challenging and stressful. Don't expect recognition financially or otherwise. Annual increases are minimal. Some work from home opportunites; however, don't plan on regular hours. Clients are across US. You may work with non US based team members and possibly some odd hours."
good,"Excellent experience with peers. In some areas or departments management is lacking managerial skills. Usually, company is not pretty active in fostering the development of new technical skills for their employees."
good,"It was not a good time i had with them i almost lost my personality ."
good,"The people are very, very, very, very friendly and the working environment is very, vary, very, very comfortable."
good,"Good, stable company with a generally good culture. Work life balance could be good in non busy season or month. Personal growth programs need to be in place"
good,"Fiserv is a good company to work for right out of college to gain real world experience. You meet lots of people with different personality types. The work load can get pretty heavy at times, depending on the department you work in."
good,"Due to size, overall change is slow, although constant.  "
good,"Easy job, bad people make this job hard. My first job in a warehouse and it is a great starter. Made life long friends from here but I've never had to deal with jealous bosses before who disrespectfully talk about one employee to another and blatantly show favoritism."
good,It was a short wonderful experience working in Fiserv. Their senior staff and management board are quite friendly and are always willing to help out in times of difficulties.
good,Fiserv has a great worklife balance but the advancement opportunities are lacking. Changes occur frequently which is to be expected but senior leadership is unsure which direction is best.
good,"It's was a nice company to work for but the Computer Software was outdated and Mangement seem like they didn't care to fix it,and were always making changes before we could fix the current problems at hand."
good,"Fiserv was a company I worked for as a temp.  This company specialize in the data software for the ATM machines in the banks."
good,I held several different sales roles at Fiserv.  I found that I received more support on implementations with existing clients that with new ones.  Pricing was higher than industry average and Technology implementations are slower than industry average
good,"OK to work for.  They are average in the below categories."
good,"Good industry but old technology, slow moving, lots of red tape and poor management. The Alpharetta campus is great and many business units so offer opportunities to switch within."
good,They provide wonderful benefits. Very fast-paced environment. Difficult to advance. Cafeteria meals provided. Game room. Vacation time all beginning day 1.
good,"Sorry worked form them 10 years ago, so I'm sure workplace culture changed  But when I was there it was a ok company to work for, very little advancement for your career."
good,"HR area is very progressive, team camaraderie is great"
good,"If you can stop on a dime and change directions, you'll be fine.  Be prepared to be flexible with minimal instruction or collaboration.  Constant shift of priorities and expectations."
good,This Global  organaztion is a fgood company to work for. This company has stopped its operations.Like most companies it is one of the companies that you can work for.
good,"pros: work flexibility. Working from home is a really plus. "
good,"Loved my team but management was incredibly lacking in innovation and care. Definitely a company where you can tell you're a cog rather than an actual person with discernible skills. Pay is great for what you do and how busy you are overall but the equipment looks and works as if it hasn't been updated since 1980, making the job itself a little more difficult. Also got a transfer/promotion and never received my pay bump."
good,Fiserv's card services is an ok place to work if you can handle stress and constant critiques. The average handle time is more important than how well you help the card holder.
good,Easy work place a lot to learn with computers nice coworkers great insurance good coworkers nice management nice vacations days work pretty easy to learn
good,"Good place to work"
good,"The job wasn't necessarily difficult. For me, it was more about the lack of professionalism. The workplace culture could improve, the hardest part of the job was the lack of communication, management was fair, I learned a lot about that job as I'm sure anyone does where they work, and the most enjoyable part of the job is all of the perks that comes with being an employee."
good,"Due to financial conditions at the company, there was always a fear of being laid off due to their financial situation which was stressful for all working there."
good,"Exciting place but stressful. Commitments are made to prospects and clients before product gets a chance to unearth the business problem beneath the request. "
good,"I have not worked there in years and, more importantly, I worked for an affiliate, which no longer exists.  I did enjoy my time and the people there; however, these comments may be outdated."
good,This is a nice place to work however the size of the business does not offer much room to grow. A good place to work for college students or entry level applicants.
good,"Typical Customer Service Representative. "
good,People are generally nice and would like to help each other. Corporate provides training programs for associates to grow. Good work and life balance for the division I worked.
good,High pressure work environment with no personal interaction with management unless negative work information. A lot of selective favorites for advanced training and preferential treatment.
good,"Productive-  i would challenge myself to improve my production rate each day"
good,FISERV of Cleveland back when I worked there was a small mom & pop type of IT services. Eventually it was combined with the larger FISERV corporation which I know little about.
good,The Overall experience has been positive working with Fiserv
good,"Fiserv is flexible with schedule. Awesome staff, everybody work together very well. It was a good place to work but for the last 8 years  they laid off so many good and loyal employees,"
good,Fiserv bought the start up I was working. My focus to leave large corporation was to get feel for small/startup company. This large acquisition made me look for opportunities outside and was there in the company for three months only. Too short to provide any review about the company.
good,"The company in a certain sense is good but supervisors sometimes need more training, great experience was able to learn a lot of things co-workers were fun, there were times stress full a fast pace environment needed to meet deadlines daily."
good,"If your idea of a fulfilling career is holding all responsibility, being on call 24-7-365, having management second guess your every move, delivering solid solutions and being criticized for them, than Fiserv is your place."
good,"great place to work, great benefits, a lot of opportunity to learn and grown within the company, had ability to move around to different positions and learn different aspect of company"
good,"The work was interesting and I learned how to process loan applications, and how to underwrite loan packages. If the pay was higher it would have a been a good job."
good,"Love that they are moving to a more flexible work environment - we can work all over and have fairly flexible hours, but there are a lot of work hours outside typical business days. Still working on incorporating numerous mergers and acquisitions so there are a lot of siloes. Need to focus more on rewarding top performers and defining career growth opportunities to retain top talent. Lots of turnover here at the moment."
good,"Good afternoon,"
good,The days were always busy.  Most of the time on calls with Customers making sure their all their documentation so the mortgage loan could be processed.  The other part of the day was spent looking up Titles.
good,I enjoyed working here when I was in shipping and receiving.  The employees are great and the environment is friendly. I have no qualms with my experience with management or coworkers.
good,"good environment,! I .learn to work unsupervised. Management gave great support. The company had great open door policies to assist in problem solving of all nature. never knowing quitting time, offered bonus for excel work ethic"
good,a typical day if very  busy with more than enough to do. I learned the recruiting side of the business and often back up recruiter in their function.  Management was not very supportive and the work culture left a lot to be desired.
good,"A call center company, I had never worked at a call center and appreciate the job when needed but not my type of job. They were very strict, but tried to make the best of it."
good,"I worked in the web department handling calls from people using their banks' bill pay service. The work load is pretty heavy and you don't have much downtime, but the body of work is not hard. But I left when i was put to work on Popmoney as well. I am not a fan of the system at all, and neither are many customers."
good,I do not wish to make any comments at this time. Please stop insisting I do so. Seriously stop asking. OK to work at but lacks cohesive training for job required.
good,"Good company to work. The people are very good at FISERV."
good,"Repetitive Work, Very Easy no challenge, VERY LOW STARTING SALARY. Management is very laxed. Work life balance works if you still live at home with your parents."
good,I worked in the mail room which was very busy at the beginning of the month and the end of the month. very interesting job and met lots of new people.
good,"A typical work day is busy. Working here, I have learned patience. The management here is (management). Multi culture environment. The hardest part of my job is excepting the/ a ( no raise pay). The most enjoyable part of my day is enter acting with my coworkers and the teamwork we provide to meet the deadlines."
good,It was a good place to work but it was hard to advance.  At times it felt as though those who cut corners were rewarded for a job well done while those that worked hard and provided quality results were advised they needed to improve their metrics. other than that it was a good job
good,"fiserv is trying to push productivity and quality. there is more desire for productivity. there is continuous policy changes to make things better but, good hard working people are being fired or quitting at a rapid rate."
good,Fiserv was a great place to build a career. The depth and breadth of the organization allows an individual to work in many different capacities. The organization was good at promoting from within.
good,The training was really good there. Learned a lot for my first time being in a finance institute. The workplace culture was good there and I enjoyed being there.
good,"The processes are well defined"
good,"Innovative company with lots of opportunity and the workplace culture is hard and fast. Management style is based on high expectations, but encourages 'out of box' thinking."
good,"Helping  Staff."
good,"Ok, the people I worked with were friendly & helpful.  Would answer any questions & assist with any problems."
good,"Chaos is great for learning and expanding your skillset.  The experience is priceless, just remember to keep your work life balance and if you are going to work hard, play hard too."
good,"Depending on the department, opportunities can be plentiful. Good Management and team members. Organizational environment is positive.  Lots of learning opportunities."
good,"Large company, great benefits, lots of opportunities depending on area you working in.  Great people, everyone works hard and plays hard but nice place to work."
good,Fiserv provided me the opportunity to hone my skills on all Microsoft applications. I was also able to sharpen my ability to multi task and work with customers efficiently to resolve issues.
good,Working at Fiserv gave me the opportunity to advance my skills with computer applications and skills with customers. I was also able to move into a leadership position and assist my fellow colleagues progress.
good,Enjoyed going to work for this company. I was the Lead of the fulfillment department. I learned how to be in charged of a big job and get the job done in the time allow for it. I was very skillful when it came to during a good job all the account managers liked my work skills.
good,Poor healthcare and pay.  They offered tuition reimbursement and worked around my school schedule.  Most of management is good.  The last supervisor that I had was terrible.  She was one of my main reasons for leaving.  There was also not much room for advancement.
good,"The Pittsburgh Division took care of our clients and products. It was a great place to work and wonderful Co-Workers.  However, Corporate decided to close this division in 2014."
good,"In my job, a typical day consisted of coordinating customer calls to advance active projects, arranging internal calls/meetings to address Fiserv issues on behalf of customers, and compiling data from customer responses related to new product marketing efforts.  In addition, I produced various tracking reports for distribution to executive management.  I learned how to effectively manage my time without the need for supervision and direction.  Most first-line managers were great to work with, understanding of the constant sales/quota pressure, and extremely supportive during periods of intense sales campaigns.  Every one of my co-workers put in extra effort to address upper management directives and cared deeply about customer satisfaction.  The hardest part of the job was trying to gather necessary staff for the unusually high number of meetings that took place, always on short notice.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my interaction with customers, some of whom I had known for years and with whom I had developed close working relationships."
good,the work was easy but dealing with all the paper cuts from sorting mail was not fun. My coworkers were easy enough to get along with.
good,"Worked here for only 8 months out which 3 were spent at an external facility on training. The company is fun, but hierarchical."
good,Learned a lot during my tenure there - went from an accounting to a VP of Accounting.  Basically had exposure to all aspects of accounting and purchasing.  Good experience
good,Good job for helping customers on a variety of technical issues Oracle database environment with many opportunities.
good,Opening and processing customers accounts is the typical day.  Management was on hand to ask questions. My co-workers were very helpful in showing me the right way to do the work. The hardest part was trying to get to know all the accounts. The most enjoyable part was when my boss told me I was doing such a great job.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew and it was more difficult to get to know the new people. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day, ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting."
good,"Good work life balance, manage your own workload not micro managed good people but lack of direction from the top. Better strategy needed."
good,"Training was very clear and straight to the point. Management was a bit rude but very helpful when need be. Employees were great, everyone was willing to help each other."
good,"co-workers work as a team. Not a difficult job, but one that pays attention to detail and time constraints. We do have special fun days and occasional food day."
good,"Fiserv was a very interesting place to work. A typical day at the job for me was to open the switchboard, pull messages and send or load a Facet case to that department. Get ready for the clients that came from banks for training. I would take the photos for the badge so that the client could enter the floor/s because the building was secured. Once all classes were started I would report to my station and pull reports for the managers for their daily meeting and put information on a spread sheet. I loaded Facet cases and sent to departments when the banks had a problem with their branch.I also ordered reports needed by auditors at the end of the year. I learned a great deal at Fiserv because they did the programs for banks. I worked in billing for reports needed by auditors and that was interested. My co-workers were great people and willing to help when needed. The only thing, it was just two of us that did my job and I would feel bad calling in when I didn't feel well. I made it a point to go into work so that she wouldn't have to work so hard when I didn't come in.The most enjoyable part of the job was that management would give us functions at the job like Thanksgiving Dinners, BBQ's, Mexican lunch, ice cream outings, etc. They did at times act like they cared for the employees. The hardest part of the job was I never knew where I would be doing because at times we were short handed and I would have to do several jobs and stay overtime especially if I had to cover for someone and I was salary."
good,"Would not recommend anyone to apply for employment at this company.  Team Leaders and Managers were not professional. Co-workers were not helpful when you needed assistance. The hardest part of this job, was being productive with so much chaos on the work floor."
good,Management is out of touch but company position is so strong it won't show for years.  They cut strong programmers for now apparent reason not just deadwood.
good,its a good company to work for. never know what I will be doing from day to day working in the fraud protection department.
good,in between the lines .. my cons about fiserv is the salary.. machine operators get paid less amount than the assembly workers
good,this was a great place to work. I had meany responsibilities and was challenged on a daily basis getting the prepaid solutions group up and running.
good,Downtown work environment a plus.  Multiple shifts to work.  Easy transportation to and from south and north side of Chicago.  Overall okay place to be employed.
good,"Was a huge over load or under load and a lot of pressure to get the tasks completed. No one was professional not even my managers or supervisors. Pay was not enough, we all were worked more then we made. The only benefit was my medical plan. Then I and a others were laid off in June 2014."
good,"I spend the day working on release notes, installation guides and online help files for four to five products at a time. My co-workers are very professional and know how to get the job done."
good,"Fiserv is a fortune 500 company , Condentuality , Management was good co-workers were great , Most enjojable was the company parties."
good,"I feel for the amount of commitment and the company expects they do not pay us enough. The pay would be okay if I had a spouse whom made more money and this was a secondary income but it is not a self supporting job for me. Supervisors are okay but not properly trained. For what their background is, it is impressive with how much they can maintain."
good,"every day is different and a new challenge. as a Fiserv associate i get to work with a number of clients a day and work on various issue like balancing GL's, trouleshooting problems or just being there and listin to them resolve their own problems, i love to be a part of a team that collectively works well together. we all have our individual talents and expertise but as a whole our objective is the same: to keep the customer happy and to assist them in anyway way we can"
good,good. they were a good company which wasn't that good but everything else was good.
good,"long odd hours, i learned that if you are a manager you can hire your whole family.Its an ok place to be for a transitional job if you not planning on going to upper management. Work"
good,"At FISERV, Managers were not interested in helping others. The team leaders were helpful. The managers did not care about the associates. If any question were needed to be answered the associates were given different answers for the same question."
good,Was brought on the try and sell a technology solution that had no previous enterprise sales for the past 3 years.  Currently only 3 enterprise customers on the platform.  The risk side was the possibility that the group and solution set I sold would be shut down and existing clients would go into maintenance mode.  This occurred in Oct. 2014 after only 8 months of my joining Fiserv.
good,A growing company with new management and everyone attempting to discover where they fit to be most effective and productive for the organization.
good,Company was excellent to work for when they were RSA.  Benefits and focus changed with acquisition by FIserv.  Good benefits and local staff
good,"Fiserv is process driven company. All the processes are set and yet improving. Slowly moving towards integrating ERP systems. Management is flat and quite approachable. They follow open door culture. Typical day starts with a  review with Manager, taking an update on the previous day's work and set timelines for the new day. All Managers are great task masters and also great friends. HR is a great team, we plan pot lunches, go out for movies and parties and support each other as much. All HR folks are quite dedicated towards their work and ensures that associates are well taken care off. "
good,"I was processing checks on a daily basis. Some days we had mandatory overtime, I always stayed and did more then required to help get the work caught up. I trained the new hires as they came in and crossed trained seasoned employees on new accounts that came in. The worst part of the company is inconsistency some people not meeting the guidelines and getting away with it and others can't and are held accountable for it. The people I worked mostly were great, I still keep in contact with most of them."
good,"Fiserv has many good people, but needs more project organization."
good,"Was to learn how Images for Banking Accounts was to be processed in the Field on the Computer at Fiserv Corporation. "
good,"I felt over worked for the salary the company offered, I will not go back."
good,"flexible/ Non stressful. Work is easy and comfortable, ,very respectful people, who I work with on an regular basic"
good,"Had lots of chances to interact with associates.  The team was all remote, but we all supported each other.  On a typical day I would analyze network vulnerabilities for 7 hours and spend an hour coding or verifying mitigations. Fun stuff!"
good,The day was filled with calls from investors who were on edge about their accounts due to the performance of the market at the time (2008-2009)
good,support core software issues. work with numerous different companies under the fiserv umbrella.
good,Prepared the schedule of assigned jobs for execution on various computer systems.
good,Overall it is the co-workers that makes the job exciting. Management at times are unsure about what to do. The hardest part of the job is trying to comprehend why management do the things they do.
good,"I go into work get my log in tokens, sit at my desk open all of my necessary windows and auto in. Management was alright, there was no advancing within the company. Co workers were very friendly and family oriented. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help customers the best way possible after all options were gone. The thing I enjoyed the most was being able to speak to customers all day and assist them with any concerns that they had"
good,Not at all what I expected. It's casual and not that difficult of a job. I'm for a job that keeps you constantly busy. This is not it. Would be a great place for someone who has kids that needs a job that isn't so in depth. They do have few good perks but overall its not for me.
good,It has been a great experience working with fiserv. Started as an associate and currently working as a business analyst.The company engages their employees in different activities with the effort of building high performance team.
good,"Work with different companies from all around the world."
good,they give us free lunch during employee day.  They dont like to give raise to the employees.
good,"•Established and fostered successful business relationships with nationwide financial institutions to lead software updates and implementations in a client-facing role"
good,The company overall is one that I would say is a good company contingent upon department.  The company is not one to take new technology and advisement of their employees into consideration.
good,"Overall responsibility for all associates, revenue, expense, technology, client relations and sales"
good,Worked in a small office with one other person. Was able to work independently.
good,"Project Description"

good,"Good to work with Fiserv. I got a good future growth."
good,"enjoyed working with huge amounts of data processing."
good,Always busy but moved out of state.I worked in many different departments which allowed me stay on a little bit longer after the notification that they were closing us down.
good,I worked third shift where you came in signed on to your system and the Lead Coordinator distributed your tray of work. The job was very detailed.  Had to pay close attention to the accounts due to some having similar account numbers. The team overall was great to work with.  Everyone was willing to assist when need. Had to maintain an acceptable productivity level per hour as well as quality while being expected to complete the tray before end of shift.
good,"A typical day at work basically entailed getting through as many orders as possible.  Working here I have learned how to be more efficient and become better at multitasking.  I have a great eye for quality.  "
good,Great learning and networking opportunities. Never a boring day. 
good,"It is no longer in business.  While I was there, I learned an extensive amount about the broker-dealer industry.  I wore many hats which helped me expand my knowledge in the industry."
good,"Some managers will tell you how to do something one way and another manager will tell you a different way, this happens becuase te rules change so often that everyone is unclear on what the current rules and policies are."

good,"Provided first level telecommunication troubleshooting and problem solving; Recorded and maintained incoming issues utilizing a problem management system. Monitored communication links between host and all end user points using a monitoring system. Analyzed and escalated problems toward second level technicians; generated specific reports, graphs, and statistics. Kept client informed of modifications and system difficulties."
good,I learned alot at Fiserv and worked with many great people over the years. I really enjoyed solving complex system requests.
good,Not too organized.
good,Not a bad place to work if you do not mind being miro-managed.
good,I have been with Fiserv company what will be 2 years in August 2012. I have expirence many charges in departments. I have worked for On demand which consisted of inbound calls taking payments for the southern state customers inregards th their utility payments. While in this department I have been honored 2 times running for customer service compliments. I have also assisted (mentor) with new hire training and provided quality support for peers that were not making their numbers. I have also been trained for Bank of America Online Banking Bill Pay.

good,There can be a lot of miscommunication internally between the different departments despite the fact that they're part of the same company. Not much time spent developing employees for advancement even though there are so many opportunities to move around.
good,"A typical day at work involves Meetings and Projects and Perform Daily changes and Bank Migrations"
good,the managers are cool overall a good company. Recognizes employees have great company parties with great gifts. If you dont mind working months wothout an off day this company is for you.
good,"Good Company overall, but lot's of layoffs every year to maintain their budget, they are expanding their work in India, and work going to India due to cheep labor."
good,"More work than time, and good challenges to overcome.  Very busy, but focused and agreed with leadership wholly."
good,"Part of an acquisition ,many years ago.  It takes Fiserv several years  to decide what to do with your department.  Some positions are move to different locations and some are maintain at your facility.  Fiserv loves to re-org every year to two years.  Growth is both organically and acquisitions.   I was in a great group that has now been reduced to almost nothing.  Great group of people who have sense moved on.  Fiserv is a good company to work for considering how big it is."
good,I wasn't given proper training for the job I was hired for. I was shown an example and I was expected to create an entire business model. I didn't have the qualifications for the position.
good,"Fiserv offers very good benefits along with good compensation."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of several meetings for the projects and monthly meetings for the project team. There was some travel for work, but that reduced due to budget constraints. My responsibilities slowly evolved into ones that were not within my job description and did not match my previous experience. I ended learning a new set of skills that didn't help me progress in the direction I had hoped in my career. Unfortunately, there was no effort made in using my skill set in the near future. Fiserv work culture as well as work/life balance is very dependent on the business unit in which one works and the management team for which one works."
good,"A typical day at work starts out with 3-4 meetings with our team in India to get updates on their work, answer any questions they have in preparation for their next day."
good,"Not a top tier technology company"
good,Great if you meet their standards. Very cut throat and a great place to work if you meet what they consider to be adequate. I enjoyed the challenge and would recommenced.
good,"Company needs to implement a training program that provides employees with all the tools necessary to comfortably perform in their roles, especially in the customer support roles. Friendly environment. Good benefits. Work/life balance appropriate. Work environment and position is fast-paced and can be quite chaotic when the tools needed to support the role are not clear or specific."
good,Management ignored the complaints of poor ventilation in the building which was causing some associates to become ill with headaches and or nausea. Fumes from the passing trains and manufacturing plane nearby would permeate the building.
good,"Long hours, lots of weekends, some flexibility with telecommute, silo approach to tech, no time for self improvement/study, didn't really improve my career in any measurable way,"
good,"Typical day at Fiserv was to sign on and review any e-mails in order to may become abreast of what the day may entail.  Remain Positive and smile, and give great service. Each day is different and you must be able to be flexible.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make the client happy.  The hardest part of the job is the micro management."
good,"Fiserv Investment Services is the smallest business unit of Fiserv."
good,"Fiserv is in the midst of a culminating a unified culture in the company and it is going through the growing pains of the process. Fiserv can have a huge intangible advantage should it execute this successfully. They are currently investing in lots of training to disseminate this cultural message. They start the message at the senior leadership meeting, and then to various levels of managers."
good,Good place to work. Worked 5 days a week and on weekends for no extra pay - was required to do so from management. Had to work 11:00PM Saturday night till 8::00AM Sunday morning.
good,"I worked at Fiserv for many years. It was friendly but due to the banking industry, it was quite fast paced and stressful. However, the benefits were good."
good,I learned about detailed check processing and fast paced due to deadlines regarding East Coast and West Coast Banking but also learned how teamwork and communicating works.
good,"I had big expectations from Fiserv however I was disappointed."
good,The workplace is a very friendly and diverse environment to be a part of. The only down fall is that moving up in the company is not really available. It is available based on job availability not necessarily ones work performance or ability.
good,Nice company to settle down. WFH facility is unlimited unless n until ur manager interfere.  As it is product based company yearly hike is better than service based.
good,Great work environment and learning is good some times it depends on the team lead as well. Polices are good for employees.
good,Enjoyed working in the company. Team members were helpful. managers are good. food and transportation facility is good.
good,"I received assignments and completed them as quickly and accurately as I could."
good,"Management was informative and helpful."
good,Overall it is effective. Good learning opportunities. If you are lucky you might a travel chance too very soon. good luck
good,it is a nice place to work at with great employees and management always willing to give somebody a chance to progress in his/ her career.
good,"Nice place to work , a product oriented company with learnings on Banking domain."
good,Every day is casual Friday. Many co-workers are helpful in answering questions and supportive.
good,"Reactive environment address and communicate system issues to clients and collaborate with cross function peers for speedy remediation.  "
good,"Data entry, 10-key, reconcile, and everything else to item process. We provided service to a wide range of banking institutes. It was a job that you could be proud of."
good,Solid company with an abundance of solutions to assist financial institutions. Highly competitive market but well positioned to succeed.
good,Typical day would be taking 40+ calls in one shift. Management always micro- manage associates.
good,Fiserv has giving me the experience I need to go to the next level.  
good,Fiserv is an industry leader who values creating relevant products for its clients. 
good,Overall I had a very positive 9 1/2 years working for Fiserv.
good,Fiserv is a nice company to work.
good,Typical day includes talking with clients about offered consulting services. I have learned a process management and what steps to go through to best help Fiserv's clients.
good,"A good place to work, but more improvement is possible and required."
good,"A typical day at work would look something like you see in most office scenes in the movies. A bunch of people in cubicles taking calls from customers, in this case was bank employees needing help with end of day numbers or help with an ATM issue."
good,"Fiserv is extremely stressful. I worked in the customer solutions division and other departments. The company overwhelms you with strict guidelines where if you don't follow them, you get marked off. When you don't meet the handle time (which is outrageous), or mess up on your calling scripts, you are forced to discuss why you are under performing with your supervisor twice a month. Yes, Fiserv, does have good pay for a CSR and has nice benefits but, the mandatory overtime, and the forcing of  multiple random tests (some don't even make sense) is ridiculous. Also, every week you get cussed out by wicked customers. Lastly, if you want to be tied down with corporate policies, feel undervalued at times, but, make descent money with good benefits, Fiserv, might be for you. Oh yeah, Fiserv, does shine on your resume which is fantastic when you decide to move on."
good,I enjoy the job and it is a great and productive work atmosphere but as a single parent with no support the schedules are not flexible and make it difficult for me to work and provide for my kids
good,"* Good: My manager also had been a programmer.  "
good,Company is currently merging with First Data and will experience instability for some time.  It is a company built with acquisitions and did have the pains associated with all the acquisitions.
good,I'm working here with e-Payment from last 1.6 years. I'm enjoying my work and I am always trying to make everyone happy through the fun activities. But I have to switch for other organizations bcoz they have a very slow process of promotions lower salary increment in the organization.
good,I really enjoy working from home and having the flexibility to change my hours due to doctor appointments or my children's schedule. Working evenings or weekends was never an issue for me.
good,Workload around the company was not balanced.  Some people had to work extremeley hard and long hours to get all their work finished while others had a very easy job by comparison.  Many employees had to work from home in the evenings to complete their work while some people could leave on time every day.
good,"It will vary with each position within the company, but the repetitiveness of everyday activities can be stressful and mind numbing. It's not at all a bad place to work, but if you are looking for something more challenging, then you might become wary. Otherwise, management was very friendly and professional. They were as flexible as possible. Fiserv provides great typical office experience and you are able to learn from working with a variety of clients. This has been a great resume booster."
good,"Great benefits and positive outlook over all.  Incentives or bonuses are tweaked generally twice a year.  Lots of contests for special projects that may occur. Fast paced, heavy call volume."
good,"I've worked in the Investment Services BU. Great place to work for those who value job security and work/life balance over advancement. I'd say that being nice, not making waves and maintaining a tranquil work environment are valued more than anything else. (Obviously not screwing up your work too.) Promotions are very few and far between due to the majority of people there having 10+ years in tenure. The turnover is very low and new opportunities for advancement open up very rarely. Compensation tends to be on the low end when compared to similar roles in other companies and there aren't any perks to speak of. For those who do not seek much and do not expect to receive much, this should suffice. The more ambitious-minded should keep looking."
good,"It was a fast paced call center. Theres nothing else to tell and I dont want to take your review. Ifeel like screaming , I just want to post my resume,"
good,I enjoyed my time at Fiserv. Very stable well known company. Management was rigid and had to play by the rules. Great work life balance. No overtime worked.
good,"It could be an alright place to work if you enjoy production incentives.  I do not.  I feel it takes away from the team environment, and communication is poor."
good,"Started out as a GREAT small business but got too big too fast. Sold out to corporate giants and the family atmosphere was lost. In the end, you kept your job if your manager liked you instead of doing your job well."
good,"Interesting products and colleagues to work with.  Firm is growing, pay is decent.  The only negative thing is the frequent re-organizations are distracting."
good,"Great people, One of the pioneers in their industry. Some programs/products should be either modified or combined to keep up with the demands. Overall good Job Work/Life Balance"
good,Relaxed work culture. Company is primarily an IT product company focus on analytics is still weak. Good for experienced professionals. Not good for freshers/graduates
good,"The day in Fiserv is always tiring but in the short span of time I have learned many tools and technologies with the great hands on experience in the field of live projects on data ware housing and data migration. Management is good,they just want you to perform extra ordinary always and co-workers are also skill full but as always there is always the competitive spirit in everyone which can harm you in an other way. The hardest part of the job is to work beyond limit,doing all the late stays and late night work will seriously give you a big headache and the most enjoyable part of the job is the flexible hours."
good,"Great team of few individuals focused on innovative software dev. Fun people to be with!"
good,The pay needs to be more for the work people do.  They hire coming in more than what they pay the people that are still there.
good,"Average workplace."
good,"Fiserv is a stong and leading brand in the payments space and overall banking platforms.  That said, the consumer marketing focus is not as well-tuned and has limited grwoth potential over time. Overall, Fiserv as an industry leader, with a strong and market-forward reputation, I am proud to be a part of this team."
good,"Fiserv is an old school IT company.  The business leaders want to be cutting-edge but the business struggles as it limited with specific constraints in servicing its main customers, banks.  Overall good flexibility in most departments.  3% 401k match only average."
good,"Batch Processing was fun, you learned a lot and its a nice job for college students. I wouldn't make this a career though. You have to process 20,000 batches in a months work and its feasible but if you're a slow worker, then this is not the job for you."
good,Due to following of scrum framework within this project it has been a great journey from initiate of the project to deployment it took 4 years. The most hardest part of scrum is meeting commitments and when you really meet them its win-win for every body.
good,"As a product based company, fiserv provides good work life balance for associates. Less work pressure. But, too much process oriented stuffs, sometimes causes irritation."
good,"Fiserv provided great benefits and I learned a lot about the financial industry.  Management was not located near and phone communication was a must, however, management also traveled a lot and attended a lot of meetings.  The most enjoyable part of the job was client relationships.  My clients looked forward to seeing me visit and trusted my judgment on product placement."
good,"Work duties varied from day to day which was something I liked. "
good,"When I initially began working there, we were always busy, and on average worked over 40hours a week.  When they started to lose some of their clients to advances in technology the hours began to fade and employees were being laid off."
good,"There is plenty of work to be done. There is constant growth. However, there seems to be constant turnover due to the long hours and weeks. It is a great technical environment, with many skilled people."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. I started at Fiserv 17 years ago and that was when we had many banks to process. The back operation field for banking is a industry that will close. The branches are all now scanning the work.
good,"Worked for First Data and merged with Fiserv in 2019.  There are a lot of positives about the company and the job.  Good leadership, good hours, good pay.  The issue for me is there is not a lot of great."
good,"Management is ok, they should take in consideration with their point system people have lives and unexpected situation do pop up. Training class should be more hands on instead of just note taking. They are well organized"
good,"Pros"
good,This job is really faced passed. The turn around is high and seems work never ends. The departments lack structure and something always brakes. You have to be on your toes at this job and be open minded.
good,"Fiserv was a high check processing job with large volumes.i enjoyed the fast pace of the job only draw backs was lack of work at certain times of the year. they had certain times of the year where the employees had days to play games or was provided free lunches.i thought the management team there was great ,they had meetings several times thru out the year keeping us inform on the changes made within the company"
good,"Except for the management, I don't have any complaints from the  company. There is a lot of politics going on at a senior level. If you are not in good books of the manager, no matter how good you perform, you will not be awarded appropriately."
good,A very well organized Fortune 500 company. Shares have continuously increased in value over the past decade for a reason. Profitability is up and efficiencies and organization improve each year.
good,"A typical day was operating a inserter that processed bank statements for mailing purposes and when needed i worked in the warehouse area and received products and material and organized them throughout the warehouse.  "
good,"I have only worked for this company for about a year and a half, we were brought on as part of a merger. So far a good company to work for, people in management are always there to help any issue that you may have."
good,"Good feedback from management. One-on-one bi-weekly meetings with your immediate supervisor is company policy. Very friendly work environment. Work load, for the most part is very manageable, not a sweat shop. Very flexible work environment. I had flex hours and could work from home when necessary. The health plan could use some improvement. They have high deductible health plans which don't pay until after you meet a high deductible. They do have a standard health plan but the employee contribution is so high, you're better off with the high deuctible one. When it comes to year-end performance reviews, they base it on a bell curve. In other words, someone always has to get ""does not meet expectations"" even if you are meeting expectations. This really sucks, as this is the basis for pay raises."
good,"Great place to work and learn account operations management in a mission critical environment."
good,"Good work life balance .."
good,"During my career at Fiserv, I have had a good experience with management in listening to my thoughts and taking my opinions into perspective."
good,"Worked with some great people."
good,"Being a recent college graduate I was ecstatic to have a full-time job in this economy. It became evident after the first year, however, that what I do everyday will never change. It's the same thing, 9-5, 40 hours a week, Monday-Friday...same...exact...stuff."
good,"Teams coordinate well between other teams in different departments, able to meet goals even under crisis. Difficult to advance due to competitive culture, however, job security is good here as their as a lot time given to learn, however management is strict on employee growth and what they learn."
good,FISERV is excellent to get started in working with Servers and some Mainframe configuration.   Not a clear timeframe on advancement but good group dynamics.  They are real challenged in documentation of installations.
good,"Was a cool office with good people. Learned a good deal about financial transaction, back then anyway. Some really smart management. Varied culture and peoples. Was a very busy part of town. The office space was very nice and comfortable."
good,"As I walked in my work place, it was always a pleasure to be at work. I learned many things,but what stood out most was meeting deadlines and that was very important. Everyone got along well and if there were any tension between anybody, the whole office did not know about it. I've done my job for many years and yet there were still some challenges such as when the systems were upgraded. What I enjoyed about this job was coming to work at a very positive and friendly environment."
good,Great company or work for and has a incredible work culture. I have personally grown in this position and was able to become a better technician.
good,"Fiserv is a large company that demands a high degree of time and commitment from their employees. I have been very proud to represent the company and I have learned many new skills working there. The solutions and products that I have sold are key to my clients competing in the marketplace. I have worked with a great group of people from all over the country."
good,"in this call center environment it can be stressful and there is always changes happening. i have learned so much about card security."
good,Good company to work for.  Fun working enviornment and everyone gets along well.
good,Work and Personal life balance is great in this company. Flexible office timings.
good,"Give Fiserv a chance. Anywhere you work will not be perfect but Fiserv is worth it. Fiserv is very understand, flexible and you have great vacation time. If you are ready to diligently work and get the job done then this is the place for you."
good,Change is a constant here. Competitive results based performance is expected. Pay for performance at or above market salaries great benefits . Company doing very well and beats it’s com
good,"Excellent company to be settled down. Great work life balance. Not hectic schedule, many employee engagement activity for team collaboration. Company norms strongly supports feminist thoughts"
good,Depending on your team and business unit will determine your happiness. The role I have is great however you can feel overwhelmed when it comes to the application's complexity.
good,"The job provided fun activities, snacks, and other options that gave their employees the chance to enjoy their work duties."
good,They doesn’t give you enough training to get the job down pack. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the different envelope. The workplace is very nice and quiet. The people are friendly and welcoming.
good,"Average Office culture. "
good,"My job duties as a reconciler were routine. Team work was required for all units to meet required deadlines and customer expectations. Job advancement was not shown to me to be a priority,  Communication between management and non-exempt staff was weak. I learned how to outsource my job. My co-workers were supportive until the final phase of the outsourcing.  Then some became combative. The hardest part of the job was working below my capabilities and seeing sub-standard work from my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team work and meeting our goals and deadlines"
good,Significantly changed company over time; Management is out of touch with boots on the ground team.  Strong backlash if disagree with any direction.  No training and no management support for new hires.
good,Mandatory overtime which included nights and Saturdays. Training very sketchy. If mistakes were made no insights are provided to make it right. Management would lie on employees reports and if the employee denied the charge would make them sign or loose their positions. During mandatory overtime they would bring in food for the employees to eat that were heavy in carbs. You were not allowed to go get your own food even if you were on a strict diet because of things like diabetes or high blood pressure.
good,not a good place to work.....the management is really poor. they call you in for mandatory overtime within 5 hrs..............................................
good,It's ok to work but too many day off and I rather work more than 30 hours per week or full time plus benefit.
good,Fiserv is a good company to work for but they aren't perfect. They have bad communication skills within the higher up positions and often times the pickers are in the dark about the new things that are going on. I personally feel like the worklife/homelife balance isn't the greatest but otherwise I really have no other complaints.
good,"The job turn over is very high. Being at Fiserv (Sagent Lending), management turnover is very high. Job security is very unknown at times. When walking into the building, you're not sure if you'll have a job from the time you walk into the door until the time you leave out the door. From the 5 years I've worked at Fiserv (Sagent Lending), I've probably asked if I was going to come in the next day. I never felt safe. You'd see people leave (terminated or quit) daily. The management never really seemed as if they knew what they were doing."
good,So there are no written processes or on boarding documents. It is kind of fend for your selves with the wolves behind you. My manager says I don't how skills for a promotion while not saying what application and skills I am lacking nor does he know. It isn't bad here if there were written processes it would improve this company greatly so managers can't just roll over and make a rule up that day. I was hired as a contractor to go full time and there was never a plan for that to happen.
good,It's an okay job for a person right out of college. They do notpromote from within if you don't have a degree. I liked the management but The pay is not that good.
good,great hours staff was ok management could have been better. more organization for training needed and more stability for positions available due to being hired as temp
good,A typical day at Fiserv is busy and require a lot of multi tasking. Because I work on ecommerce there is always something new to learn or a new product upgrade. Its a knowledge sharing culture that allows for cross training.
good,"ok place to work, pay is not the best for what work they want done each day.  My co-workers were fun to work with, kind of slow paced work."
good,"Good benefits but could have paid us more,"
good,I would not recommend this job to anyone. they have very old management. one worker has been there for over 18 years and his stuck in his ways.
good,They were new to telemarketing so it wasn't organized and no one knew what they were doing.
good,"I've been at Fiserv for 1 years time. Overall it isn't a horrible place to be but like every place it has its pros and cons. It has job security and they are always trying to bring in new clients. Their benefit package isn't the best but it isn't the worst either."
good,"A typical day at FISERV was very challenging work. Working on a very robust Financial product, with teams in 4 parts of the world, a over 300 team members and competitive co-workers. The hardest part of the job was to meeting the deadlines, specially when we are multi tasking and working on several releases at the same time. The hardest part was the most enjoyable part since it made us stay on top of things every single minute of working at FISERV on ACUMEN product."
good,Fiserv has competitive wages. The pay is good for customer service work. They also have good benefits. Those are the best assets Fiserv offers! Makes the stressful job worth it
good,They has great benefits but advancement is not great. The people who take short cuts are the ones rewarded. The management for the most part is cool the pay I think could be better.
good,The people are great but the management staff needs to be more strain and polish. The manager are the one that make the environment because we have a quick turn around on delivering to the customer. We need more leadership guidance with out the dram.
good,Good start up company and had flexible hours and a lot of benefits in the beginning. But started to remove benefits and ways to grow unless you knew somebody within the company to assist you with moving positions.
good,"Fiserv is a federation of acquired companies, not one company. It has an insular management group sequestered in Wisconsin."
good,"Despite my involuntary separation from the company, I was always proud to work there. The greatest thing about working for Fiserv were the people, especially those in Card Services. Unfortunately, the recurring theme was always a lack of resources for the volume of work."
good,Was a great place to work for a long time.  Great company and employees.  Recent changes made it very tough for longer tenured employees in certain areas of the company.  New management didn't give back the same loyalty long time employees gave to the company.
good,"Training is consistent and not contradicted by experience, except when changes are rolled out. Equipment provided is in good condition, even the desks and chairs."
good,21 team members have been terminated due to process layoff rest are good. Company is providing free meals and cab.  Culture is satisfactory but there is less chances of employee growth and slow way of promotion.
good,It is an okay place.  It’s not the worst place I’ve ever worked.  I know that in order to move up (get promoted) at this company a person has to be either a favorite or go work somewhere else.  People at Fiserv have been in their positions for 10 plus years and they don’t leave these positions and management have their favorites who they will help out.  Its how every place I’ve ever worked has always been.   So come here for a paycheck go to college then move on..is my advice.  You can’t build a career here. You can pay your bills though.
good,"Not a bad place to work, some great people there trying to do the right thing by clients and employee's is sometimes hard to do.  Work home life balance can be tough."
good,"There are quite a lot of people with longevity there, But it can be challenging wth constant Management changes and acquisitions."
good,"•	Investigate with the companies the payments are being processed to assure the consumer all processes are complete and secure."
good,"The benefits and work/life balance are great, but there is really no chance to advance and the management is not for their employees best interest it's all about them and their best interest. Job should pay more as stressful as it is. Most the employees their are miserable and only staying until they find something better."
good,"a typical day at work starts with cleaning of the surroundings,the machines, checking files that are due the following day and placing them in order of priority. the easiest part of the job is placing the jobs in order. the hardest part is fixing the machine when there is a technical fault as well as trying to meet deadlines when the machines are faulty. I learnt how to fix and run a machine. the management needs to focus their attention on their production team and the benefits"
good,"Fiserv is very financially focussed, with things like product strategy, culture, and people coming a distant second.  If you have a business case, you can do just about anything, but the $$$ is what needs to be at the top of the page."
good,"In many ways, Fiserv is a typical large corporation.  That is they are very fixated on the bottom line.  As such, there is a great deal of pressure to sacrifice personal time to satisfy the needs of the (often aggressive) project timeline."
good,"Interesting, fast-paced environment. Offer career development. It's a highly matrixed environment which can be complex."
good,"Good company to work for but going through a lot of changes right now which has pros/cons.  Salary is OK, but not quite in line with competition so they lose a lot of good people."
good,A good place to work with 12 hour shifts. Worked alot of Holidays. Other employees were great people. Raises were not the best
good,"Fiserv is very customer centered, as a business shound be. They, however, do not value their employees. You are told almost daily about the possibility of achieving a quarterly bonus, but it is literally unachievable. They do not give raises, but do hire new people withat no experience at a higher pay rate. There is a cafeteria there, but is fairly expensive for the small variety of foods provided. No matter how hard you try to keep them happy and do your job correctly and well, they will always find something to criticize and do not commend good work."
good,"Fun place to work, celebrated holidays with fun activities, had lunch program that you paid $30 out of each paycheck and got to eat two meals a day from company Monday - Friday only. Supervisors were extremely helpful and knew what to do and how to help you on calls. Relaxed environment but extremely strict with rules and regulations. Step one toe out of line and you were immediately fired."
good,The benefits were great. The lunch room was awesome. The cafeteria menu was great. Since the call center is 24hrs they had very flexible schedules
good,"Currently I am working with Fiserv India as Lead-Finance & handling Accounts Payable, TDS, Employee Reimbursement, Service tax, UP VAT, Insurance, Bank Reconciliation, Month end reporting. In my previous assignment I was also handling Salary Payable, PF, ESI, MIS functions. I want to relocate to Chandigarh due to my family requirement.."
good,A typical day would be about coming in and gathering all of the items you needed to get started for the day. Find out if there were any specifics that had changed. After completing your first task you would move to the next task and so on.
good,lacking advancement and low pay. Great location. Mundane position
good,CheckFree lost its competitive edge by not listening to industry changes and advancements. Charges too much for products that are not delivered on time. Nice work environment.
good,A valuable experience as all employment prior to this company was in Chicago area (residence).  I learned multiple lessons on interaction with production associates in comparison to working alongside front office personnel - most people truly care about their roles within the company.Strong leadership.
good,"Review all mail with mutual funds, stocks investments inputting the data into accounts. Hardest part of the job was constant grind of information must be inputted by deadlines. I enjoyed helping my coworkers and learned a lot of the 401K task."
good,The division I was in closed and every division was different.
good,very challanging work learned alot about all iti applications.  company and managment direction not always the same path
good,Running Machines that mailed out mail-sets on a Automated Mailing Machines.  I learned how to work at a very fast pace in a Warehouse.  The management was alright depending on who you worked for.  The co-workers were a joy to be around most of them.  The hardest part of the job was keeping your machine up and running without any machines issues.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the incentives for going above and beyond department standards.
good,usually very busy. Clients were easy to work with for the most part. Co workers are friendly. Did not always agree with management styles.
good,I enjoy my current  position and the people with whom I currently spend my days alongside. It is just that I'm looking for something more challenging to fill my days.
good,"Great place to gain experience in Fintech, as company continues acquiring businesses and developing technology to remain relevant in a fast changing industry."
good,"The management was respectful and I was working on projects that were clearly ""intern""-type work, but it wasn't just running papers and making coffee. I was learning things."
good,"a typical day at work is relaxed and felt receptive, nothing that i was mad about. working here has made me learn a lot about credit file/credit cards which came in really handy."
good,Work life balance. Lot to learn from the core banking perspective. Client interaction and involvement in requirement analysis and design . Work is appreciated too.
good,"MGMT will sell you out if they think it will make themselves look better."
good,"A good Fintech company that is always increasing its reach in the industry. That aggressiveness can lead to focus on business over people, often leading to a difficult working environment."
good,"Everyday is a fabulous day to walk into Fiserv ready to handle all the work duties giving to me. Though some days can be challenging, it is all worth it at the end of the work day with much accomplished. The management team is flexible and a really understanding group of leaders. The atmosphere is very diverse in culture and what makes the workplace fun and interesting. My favorite part of my job is being able to stay updated with the rapid changes in printing technology."
good,you have a game room and a nice cafe. Free drinks; You have to work very fast on the phones because you are timed if you dont then they will get rid of you
good,Typical fintech company. Lots of great sales people and cool products. They do a ton of acquisitions and so there is always swirl around those.  Not a a lot of HR focus though. Layoff's and hiring at the same time - no real career advancement or mentorship programs.
good,This was a decent company to work for however they are starting to outsource the work they do so are closing their doors soon. Over all was fairly pleased with the work I did there.
good,"I have been with fiserv from 9 years and it is great to work here, however everyone looking for change because of better carrier option when it is not fulfill within the organization."
good,Fast pace to insure web data posted correctly for clients data. People worked together to solve issues in a timely manor. Everyone covered each other when one person was out on PTO or called in sick. A never ending team effort.
good,"The jobs at Fiserv challenge you to do your best and can really push you to your limits. As you get through different projects, you feel satisfaction with the completion of these."
good,"Fiserv care a lot of the piers, they do lots of activity for them and listen to there opinions, they have great environment, if I wouldn't had to move I still would off being working there."
good,This place has some very brilliant people. What i dislike the most was the politics and the process to get stuff done. 95% planning and process to 5% doing. Was the most frustrating job i ever had. The people you work with are amazing at their jobs and its nice to work with people who know what they are doing so that you dont have to know what they are doing as well.
good,"Fiserv wouldn't be such a bad place to work if the upper management didn't lie, wasn't petty and was understanding. Not too long ago they started making overtime mandatory. The pay isn't terrible, they might as well do away with the bonuses they make them pretty impossible to reach."
good,"Friendly environment, fast paced, always changing to bring in more skills and support opportunities. Growth through acquisition creates other areas of focus."
good,"Working for Fiserv gave me opportunity to grow ,I started off as a check processor within a year ,I receive a promotion to Accounts Receivable Departments, and after a while the Company down size and i was laid off. I receive a servarance  package."
good,I have moved throughout different departments within my 2 years. The setting is very business casual which makes the average day less stressful. It is a fairly fast paced job.
good,I do not want to write a review or express information for this or other companies. Everyone has a different view and I do not feel it needs to be expressed on line
good,great training programs and nice management staff. OT hours were available and advancement was okay.   average hourly pay can be increased to compete.
good,"The management at Fiserv is average, but my immediate supervisor is great.  I am provided the opportunities to investigate and research new technologies at my leisure. "
good,A typical day at work doesn't change. Everything is independent work within your team. In the morning you are sent out the tasked assignment and you work on your own for the rest of the day. Communication between you and  your team members is the most important thing when working in a POD structure.
good,"Great place to gain technical experience within the FinTech  vertical.  Although salary is about 20% below industry average.  People are fantastic, workload is heavy most of the time."
good,people are great and always willing to do whatever they can to help. Clients come first and results are important when it comes to determining what defines success
good,"Fast pace, End of the the month is our busiest time of the month. heavy volume, meeting dealines. Overall this company in a good place to work for. lots of team work, The hardest part of the job is during end of year, long work hours, including weekends."
good,"Some of the people are great to work with, but it can be a very physical and stressful job, especially end of months.  Definitely have to pay to attention to details."
good,Online bill pay job.   It's Fast-paced multitasking. You receive all the benefits medical dental and life insurance 401(k) etc.  You also receive PTO days.
good,"I think the company is very good. They'll give you good compensation as well. However the hierarchy designation is completely complex to understand. HR will commit you something and you will end up having a different designation. Do confirm and take the position in written before joining. Also, the onshore partners are not very helpful, you'll have to treat them as a client not as a business partner which makes the environment not a work friendly. Do take care of the documentation properly otherwise you'll be in hot water. Additionally, the job is also not safe despite the strong cash flow of the company. You'll have to fight for saving your job."
good,"A very different experience than most, given the freedom to just do the job of taking care of the people just the way it should be done.  Nice ride thanks guys."
good,You get to learn a great deal about the way the financial system really works from the technology end. Working the 3rd shift where maintenance and release happens is the most stressful and requires attention to detail. The best part of my experience was the people I worked with.
good,Work culture is good. Management helps to grow the employee interacting directly with client to deliver tasks. This shows their trust in employee. Hr policy's also good.
good,"Lots of longevity with leadership, some ongoing integration pains from previous acquisitions.  Great client list, lots of big company process and complexity."
good,Company is really good in terms of technology and processes. Very employee friendly. Very nice company to learn. Would love to work again.
good,Ideal place to work if you are a firm with itilv3 and telecommute.  Headquarters is the better place to work as it has more perks than the other offices.
good,"Each of these companies desires to make a significant impact in their market segment which means that the businesses are driven by margin, revenue, and cost."
good,"The first 10 years, there was not reorganization.  In the last 2 years, there were 2 major reorganizations, which makes for some extreme growing pains, especially when your manager goes from being stateside to India.  I enjoyed my time with the company but, in the end, was a victim of a reduction in the workforce."
good,"A typical day at work would involve printing, data entry, and program management.  I learned how to work well with other employees and all of the daily aspects of banking data.  Management was scarce due to a graveyard shift but were available when needed.  The hardest part of the job was management being absent.  The most enjoyable part was that we were trusted to maintain a nightly routine with little help."
good,"As Business Process Analyst, my role focused primarily on analysis and quality control process enhancements and day operational activities for global procure to pay users. The typical consisted of researching and resolving  processing issues that impeded work progress. Supportive management and co-workers."
good,I enjoyed working here. The hours were perfect part time hours and the people were nice. The Management was fair and they celebrated holidays. The pay wasn't that much but it worked for me at the time. The job was not hard just fast paced at times.
good,"Our group in Phoenix was a very competent group and worked to accomplish the same goal, month end, quarterly and year end deadlines."
good,"Short work, hours ok. training has got to improve. Not there long enough to deal with management. Did not learn much because training was not organized."
good,"friendly, and nice place to work, benifits steep cost,staff hard working, Over all hard work 12 hour shifts on mandatory overtime,"
good,Overall not a bad place to work. If you can adapt with change you will do fine. I don't have anything else to say they are a pretty decent company.
good,The team I was working with was very enthusiastic and ready for any given task. I learned how to manage my time and work. It was a great environment to work in.
good,Run and operate folding machinery inspect and pack finished product. Long hours at times but the time flies by because your having fun.
good,"Has been a good place to work, with equal growth opportunities."
good,I enjoyed the work and working with the different clients and working on thier issues and getting them resolved in a timely manner
good,"Challenging but fun. Lot's of learning and great people. It has operations globally in a lot of places, so there is a lot of opportunity to meet and work with lot's of good people."

good,"Utilizing forklift, Sorts and distributes incoming and outgoing mail, Loading and unloading goods. I was at a difficult time in my life with the loss of my grandmother."
good,"Family like environment at work."
good,Fiserv is a great company that helps new employees feel like part of the team right from the get go. Working within a team of great employees helps keep individuals motivated to keep attending everyday.
good,Added debit card processing knowledge to my previously back office operations background.  Also was considered a subject matter expert for the loyalty program we offered clients.
good,"I have personally learned a lot. Started working as a fresher and learned many new things."
good,Taking over 100 calls per day. I learned how to write and talk about different things at the same time.
good,"It's a good company to start your career with."
good,Fiserv is a large corporation which provides financial services software to Banks and Credit Unions world-wide.
good,I learned a lot about myself and this company as a mail clerk.
good,"The work environment allowed me interact with associates both on-shore and off-shore with various experience levels in software development. I learned quickly how to manage many projects in various stages of the SDLC in a fast-paced environment where communication and team collaboration resulted in success. In my role, I reported to department management on a daily basis and held open conversations to resolve any resource or project plan issues. I worked well with all project team members to ensure that I understood capacity concerns when presented and worked with supervisors to alleviate the constraints. The hardest part of the job was bridging the gap between upper management expectations and resource capacity. While this proved challenging, I worked with a great group of leaders and superviors to overcome these obstacles to ensure delivery of projects on-time and within budget with high quality. I had the pleasure and great opportunity to work with a group of people with experience levels ranging from 5-30 years in my organization. Their knowledge base and willingness to teach me the systems allowed me to participate more actively in my project responsibilities."
good,"Great company to work, with work-life balance, with the ability to work from home and not very demanding projects. However it is common to have calls with other countries in unusual time-zones, especially in international projects."
good,"Most days spent testing programs, talking on the phone with co-workers and project team members.  I developed some very sound project lead skills.  The  last manager I had was the best I have ever had.  No micro-managing.  He allowed me the freedom to do my job my way (in accordance with Fiserv). Co workers were always busy but never to busy to help with a problem or answer a question."
good,"Great learning experience and support from colleagues. "
good,The Advanced Services team handled all Online Bill Pay issues that could not be resolved through the client contact channel. My co-workers and I learned to develop unique methods of problem solving and networking within the corporation as a result of the independence we were given to resolve escalated issues and satisfy the client.
good,"The years have been pretty much challenging daily. Though, overall due to changes of relocation of certain type of work had just change a lot of people's mentality and the positive outlook of the company. "
good,Multinational corporation providing various solutions to financial institutions
good,A typical day is when I have to handle the whole team. I learned the leadership skills. And I enjoyed it.
good,"A company with tremendous potential, good product set and great people.  "
good,"Fiserv is a call center that is specifically focused on excellent customer service. This call center works more with finances, so though the employees are nice and helpful the job can be stressful. Quoting a good friend of mine, ""Money is very funny"" and it can lead to stressful calls. Working for Fiserv you will need to have good people skills, patience, and alot of understanding towards a variety of situations. The hardest part of the job is learning the systems, however when hired you do have training. Once trained you are not thrown to the wolves like some other companies can do. You go through a period called Abay where members of leadership walk around and help when you need it. I enjoy my job with Fiserv because of my fellow employees, and also because there are those calls that you get and you honestly improved someone's day. The latter is what I truly enjoy the most."
good,"Fiserv is a good company oveall but there is little chance for advancement - a typical day of work start with gathering supplies, setting up the machine chosen to run the product and proceducing a quality to be mailed to clients/ customers and consumers as required   per written instructions "
good,"Management team was not one of the best. They don't tend to know what is going on. They were worried too much about their positions as well. "
good,"The work shift begins with setup of the inserting machine and assessing orders that need to be completed.  Orders are planned among all the inserter operators delegated by the coordinator to make sure appropriate orders are being completed in order.  Jobs from individual cards up to thousands of cards are done with different inserts, envelopes and shipping methods.  Management does a very good job of making sure new methods to work are created and implemented to assure the product is sent out with the highest quality and on time.  Co-workers make this job.  Being able to interact with them throughout the night makes 3rd shift enjoyable and also makes time fly.  The machines can be frustrating at times but once you figure out your own system you can make quick work of orders and the night is over before you know it."
good,I learned alot about maintaining office setting and working as a team.
good,"Fast paced and fun, caring environment."
good,"Except for the reduction in force due to decrease in volume processing, I have developed management skill and know how in the item, check processing industry."
good,"Fiserv provided me an opportunity to learn various aspects of both call centers and the financial industry. As a leader in financial services, Fiserv maintains relationships with countless banks and business partners to assist in providing world class customer service. No day was a typical day, as the challenges of resolving varied issues was only limited by your willingness to engage. A supportive, collaborative, team environment makes for a productive and rewarding work experience."
good,It provides the perfect work-life balance with a flexible work environment.
good,It was a challenging career change. It was always changing and interesting.
good,Fiserv was a place filled with friendly people who loved coming to work. Even though Fiserv was a fast paced operation I looked forward to going to work everyday. A typical day at work was busy I had daily deadlines I had to meet while processing work and getting my department ready to process work. Most days went by fast because their was always something to do. Working at Fiserv helped me enhance the skills I already had and I learned how to process work in other areas of the company. Management worked with us to resolve issues to help make working there a little easier. The hardest part of the job was....nothing if anything did challenge me I enjoyed overcoming it. I'm always up for a challenge it helps keeps me on my toes. Fiserv was an enjoyable place to work and the job I did there made coming to work all worth it.
good,"Its a great company, got many things to learn.Management was great, very easy to reach. Fun loving environment. easy for growth."
good,"If your are able to adapt to repetition, then I would suggest this position to you, but if you are not focus you may miss something in the process. The company must have been facing closure so it’s starting to pick up again with the help of other agencies in partnership, otherwise things change all the time including “best rated companies”"
good,I can say this is one of the best product based company as policies are employee friendly and flexible work environment. Get enough time to maintain your personal and professional life balance
good,Client interaction and participation in implementation gave so much exposure. Product training experience was really good especially training at bank's sites.
good,"I came to Fiserv with the understanding that many people had been there for decades. It seemed as if it would be a permanent occupation for me. However, after a merger in 2019, I found myself laid-off. Completely blind-sided by it."
good,"Very little social interaction.  In order to obtain stock holder satisfaction, as organic growth was not obtainable, layoffs of key individuals was enacted annually.  More work with less individuals.  My work was 24 X 7 due to my global reports in India, Hawaii and U.S. mainland."
good,"Loved the team I worked with. Centrally located, close to main highways. Modern building. Upper management was easy to get along with always talking to agents, keeping us involved with work concerns."
good,Great company. Offers remote or flexible work hours. However the company does alot of layoffs every year and the job never feels secure.  There is never a budget for training for employees. The company  hires from within or by employee referrals which is nice but we tend to end up with alot of employees that lack skills for the jobs they are in.
good,"Good company.  If I did my job my manager pretty much left me alone but was there is I needed something, and kept him informed.  I would go back if the opportunity presented itself."
good,"Flexible and fun workplace with less pressure."
good,"Fiserv was great.  The expectations were high, but they understood software very, very well.  Most of the managers were great.  "
good,Lots of meetings makes it difficult to get the work done. Finance systems are okay. Involved with the business is a plus. Turnover in Finance in Digital Channels.
good,"The days were never typical. The day always differed. You could have a very slow day, which to most of us meant that something was brewing. Most days there were issues that had to be researched and resolved. It could take from 2 hours of research up to a full week. "
good,"It's a call center, so you'll be answering back to back calls about fraud alerts..disputes, card activations, travel exceptions, and everything to do with cards. Management was okay. Some better than others. The mandatory overtime was ridiculous. They didn't work with me at all and threw it on you with no notice, which makes it hard to pick up your child at day care or plan anything. It was fairly easy and you can make a lot of money working unlimited hours."
good,"My colleagues at Fiserv were some of the best I've worked with.  They are professional, fun, and always has the client's interest in mind.  Unfortunately, in the location I was at, there was limited career advancement."
good,Shared a friendly work environment. Good learnings. Limited career growth. A very good place to maintain work-life balance. My office had limited recreational infrastructure.
good,Busy & challenging but exciting as each banking deal is different:  Support internal sales personnel with pricing assistance for new banks and clients that are under renewals of their current Fiserv banking solutions.  Primary goals were to maximize profits while understanding the client’s needs and issues.
good,"The funnest part on a typical day at work was having good communication among my fellow co workers. Also during lunch/ break time, taking group walks for exercise. "
good,"Great work environment, office setting.  Professional environment. .  Window views.  Great neighborhood.  I met great co workers from my training.  Beautiful women, so you want to dress bossed up.  Would still be there if I didn't smoke that blunt."
good,"Work environment was peaceful with some days working from home. While working with Fiserv I have gained a lot of knowledge of what the company has to offer its customers, however during my time I have come across some managers who are not cut to be in management. Management was the hardest part of working with Fiserv. what I like the most about working with Fiserv was getting to know people and build some good relationships with some good employees of Fiserv."
good,The hardest part of the job was getting a person to explain things if there was a new procedure. and if you didn't happen to read the newsletter you wouldn't know about a policy or daily change. .
good,"Fiserv has been around for a long time with mulit location in the United States. The location where I worked at had very intelligence people and was a joy to work with. My years there was enjoyable experience. I wouldn't mind working there again sometime in the future. The offices were very well kept and the appearance ver nice."
good,you will work go home not exciting bad management low pay. Not much movement and no career lacks advancement and praises telling on one another and get favorable treatment and rewards
good,"Enjoyed the job itself, the people and management.  This was a part-time job for me and seasonal."
good,Gained a lot of knowledge in the insurance and finanical field while working at Fiserv. My ability to multi task was greatly enhanced due to various assignments that I was required to complete.
good,"Free coffee, tea, soda, and even a cafeteria plan where one can get their breakfast and lunch at really low cost, deducted from paycheck at a flat rate. "
good,This is the best company for work life balance where they are still working on old technologies which is not helpful for any one as part of their career growth.
good,Loved my supervisor and most of people I worked with. But there are many disagree management decision within the company. Many options to choose in order to be in the company.
good,The work life balance is bit tight depending on which project you are working. However there are chances for onsite deployment provided you have good relationships with onshore partners.
good,They are a great place to start a career in financial services. Its a growing company so there is room to expand. I would recommend working for Fiserv
good,"Much of the staff, including most of the departments, had a strong emphasis for healthy living. Weather that meant hitting the gym together after work, or helping each other stay on their Atkins diets. "
good,"Originally known as BillMatrix, it was a small but growing company with a great culture.  After Fiserv acquired BillMatrix, the culture was immediately affected.  Management change impacted this as well.  Then we merged with Checkfree and I actually clients tell me they would not deal with them."
good,"Good company to wok for. Fast moving. Forward thinking. Very large but still growing. As a manager at Fiserv, you wear many hats, and as a result, you have opportunities to learn a great many things."
good,"Jobs are only as secure as the management you report to.  If they have an agenda, it could be your demise.  No matter how good you are."
good,Learnt a lot of good stuff. Fun place to work. A good work life balance. Diverse background to work in. Nice and knowledgeble peers and managers
good,They were a company but are changing not for the better.  Great bunch of people to work with.  Flex work hours after they moved to Alpharetta. Would recommend Fiserv to someone just starting out good training and experiences.
good,"This place can only improve. Not in a snarky way but in the sense that this is a growing company that is making leaps and bounds in its field. "
good,basically a job dealing with mail and and machines. standing on feet for 40 hours everyday doing factory work you get only one 30 minute lunch (paid lunch) good overtime depending on department
good,"Management should take important steps to save brilliant employees. Not an HR led company. Can get Better if all work together."
good,Was a great place to gain more experience and I did walk away with so much more knowledge about how call centers are ran and how each employee plays a role in the bigger scheme of things.
good,"Working environment is relaxed."
good,"Fiserv is one of those companies that should be failing, but stubbornly, isn't. The ""acquire and incorporate"" model has been very successful, as evidenced by the meteoric increase in FSV stock. So, one must concede it's working."
good,Very busy high pace environment. Nice people to work around. Acquired very old 10key skills working with numbers. Hardest part of job is you work on so many different accounts making sure you keep them straight.
good,"Supportive Management and team work. Since it was my first I learned a lot from my colleagues, i grew and developed myself really fast. I learned that how to manage and complete the tasks within the prescribed time. Training team was very supportive in providing the training whenever it was required."
good,great company. great benefits. great environment. creative environment. stressful job. dealing with stress. competition is ferocious. no personal attention to individuals.
good,"For the most part Fiserv is a great place to work. People are devoted, respectful and kind...I was one of them. However, new management started weeding out high experienced individuals with out of college individuals to save money. I get it...it's business."
good,"Requirement Gathering for Cash Management Product which includes Payment System like ACH, Wire Transfers, Check Truncation,BAI. Sound Knowledge of Capital and Finance Market including Derivative Products.SDLC, QTP and VBScript"
good,"Its a joy to help resolve customer bank and credit card issues via the phone and software programs.  My former co-workers were always there for me when I need explanation, support or for a good game of pool.  The most challenging part about this job was trying to inform customers about potential fraud on their personal accounts.  However, as their issues are resolved, they would reward me with compliments."
good,"I had work with the same people for 14 years I Assisted in Mail Room, Statement department and Sort Room. We processed checks for 50 different Credit Unions and Banks with the Statements to go out with the check we sorted daily."
good,"nice managment"

Churning of Code in factoring and refactoring SuperClass structures of middleware built upon Plumbing of OOP.
good,Very fun place to work. Great learning experience.Good working enviornment.
good,A typical day at work would be busy from start to finish. The day would usually begin with you assisting the previous shift with deadlines. Hopefully you would have enough manpower that would not tie you down from prepping your work for your team that would be coming in for your shift. I learned a lot from the Mgrs. on how to prioritize and not get so overwhelmed by the end of your shift. The co-workers sometimes made it a little challenging but for the most part they kept you pretty busy. To me the hardest part of the job would be not enough employees to complete a days work. The enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people as well as training them.
good,"A typical day at work was pretty much the same every day, log in, answer calls, go on scheduled lunch and breaks, go home. I learned how to block lost and stolen debit cards to prevent fraud for card holders. co-workers here were the best, everyone got along."
good,at fiserv we would ran 5 machines a day. ive learned alot about Mail. the management and co workers were nice and there was a few co workers. the hardest part was working night shift. most enjoyable was when we would have pitch ins
good,"The ability to learn job skills in three different departments, master them and become the Lead over staff."
good,everyday was different
good,"Working at Fiserv was a good learning experience, the company was pro hiring within and promoted various positions as well as enforced the values and integrity of the company and its services"
good,"Typical product based company, I was joined when Fiserv was a newly established in Pune. Learned culture and work here. It was a nice experience and great team I worked with."
good,"Fun place to work with good compensation, and industry standard benefits. Mission driven company, with an open door management team. Family feel in most areas of the company."
good,"Good atmosphere to work with flexibility to work remotely if needed. "
good,Fiserv was a very enjoyable place to work on most days and had everything you can think of as far as employee comfortability. The only downfall is simple sitting in one spot for hours on end while dealing with angry customers. That and the pay is very low with not much room for growth.
good,"The position is unfortunately very ""Corporate America"" so there is always a feeling of uncertainty. The management team I am under is very supportive and helps to promote internal growth."
good,This company has strictly 9 Hours work Culture. Provides Cab facility irrespective of shift timing. Work Place is good with lot of extra curriculum activity happening every now and then.
good,This was a good place to work with great employees. The company really prefers to promote from within. Training could be better and more important. Upper Management needs to be more involved with their employees.
good,"Nice work environment, with collaborative and helpful team. Training could be improved. Also regulations, procedure and compliance could be properly disclosed as far as updates go."
good,"Some promises made to me were broken when I was laid off after 20+ years and new management took over."
good,Fiserv was a great company to work for.  I learned a lot when I first started and it allowed to take that knowledge on to the next chapter of my life.  The traveling was great and it allowed me to meet a lot of wonderful people.
good,"For the three years at this position, I enjoyed the position and the interaction with my co-workers and clients.  It was a team environment to introduce and convert banks and credit unions to the Open Solutions financial products.  The project was usually 6 - 9 months and required travel to the clients location 4-5 during the project.I conducted training, reviewed the product conversion with the client.  Then balanced the file conversion during the testing phases and at the final conversion."
good,"I was hired to head a special project and was given a lot of autonomy. My managers were non-technical but really great problem solvers and great at empowering their team. "
good,This was a good place to work but management was not supportive at all.  No opportunity for advancement but the flexible hours are good.  Easy going work which allowed for additional projects.
good,I enjoyed working for the business. I learned different internet printing applications and other useful job duties. I would of loved to stay there doing the jobs for a longer amount of time.
good,"The place advertises themselves as a place with lots of advancement. To me that angle seems like a bait and switch, when hired as a card services associate you are likely to laterally move across different departments on the 4th floor and will rarely get an opportunity to move to management or another department entirely. This is a good job for someone working and going to school but not for someone with a college degree, your potential will not be recognized and you will get very frustrated."
good,"This is a 3rd party company that offers numerous services to smaller banks and credit unions. They have a number of sites all over the US, Including GA, NC, OH, and AZ."
good,"My opinion of Management are the employees that have worked their for years and have moved into better positions. If you are hired to be a specialist you will more than likely have to teach everyone on your team including management. The cubes are short so no snoozing at work, just kidding. I would say stick to the overall plan of making management happy and you will be ok here."
good,"Typical day at work was answering more calls than my fellow trainee and getting worse scores on the stats. The company wants quantity not quality. Learned that its a great company to get hours, $ & benefits but often sacrifice your family time. Management does their jobs. Workplace culture was fun and UNLIMITED FREE COFFEE. Hardest part of my job was getting my numbers where the company wanted them. Most enjoyable was the free coffee and making callers happy despite the numbers."
good,"Good relationship with Federal Reserve client focused technical Implementations. WebSphere and webserver configurations, using updateloader, patching migrations, tuning, MQ and MQSeries, WS backup routines, environment alignment, troubleshooting and implementations of using Jython related code (wsadmin) creating application servers on Check 21 Solutions products.

good,The staff was nice everybody work together very well. It was a fast paced job which is a good thing you kept busy till the work slowed down.everybody was willing to help.
good,I've had a positive experience working for Fiserv... Learned a lot and met nice people. Fiserv was always flexible with me and I was given the opportunity to advance.
good,A typical day is goal setting for myself before start of my shift.  I enjoyed my work schedule and interacting with my coworkers.  My biggest joy everyday was fulfilling the customer needs.
good,"Work can be very challenging due to the extreme number of projects always going at the same time.  There is never a lack of work or learning opportunities.  "
good,Doing the work was great but can be stressful with different people who all think they know more than anyone else and don't listen.  But overall a good place to work.
good,"The company has grown by acquisition so there are a fair amount of technology issues that hamper efficiency and add layers of red tape and complexity that shouldn't exist."
good,i would recommend the company for future employment.  The coworkers are great to work with and the managers are easily approachable in time of need for concerns.
good,This was a high paced pressure job that was audited everyday.  Learning their system and what they wanted accomplished each day was challenging but exhilarating.  I enjoyed it.
good,"The work was very interesting and dynamic. There was always a lot going on, but the number of organisations and regional hubs made it very difficult to work across the company as a whole. "
good,"I have been with Fiserv for 7 months and have enjoyed the culture, it is very exciting. I look forward to the future. There seems to be a lot of room for growth."
good,"Good co-workers, great diversity, excellent pay, good benefits.  Upper management could use some fine tuning, but in general I think it was a great place to work.  Only left to move back to my home town in another state"
good,Very good place to learn new things. It helps me to understand the complete project end to end applications. Food quality is not good in canteen. Thanks
good,Fast growing company to work for. Technology is always changing in the financial industry so Fiserv is a big part of that and it's rewarding. Global company.
good,"Overall good company, work life balance is good, management is also good , Job environment      is good ,        As per compare with market appraisal is ok."
good,I enjoyed working for Fiserv. The team environment was great and the management team was understanding and knowledgeable. The work was interesting and the business partners were also knowledgeable.
good,"In my eyes this was a very uneven experience.  I thought the salary was commensurate with my background, but the benefits left something to be desired.  The atmosphere was schizophrenic and not conducive to getting things done."
good,"Been a machine operator is exciting, I was able to work with all kind of CNC machines, I learnt a lot because it is very related to my major and I am happy with the experiences I had at the job"
good,Being able to work with my peers on a daily basis and to include international associates my the job very enjoyable.  We all learned a lot together and really made a difference.
good,Fiserv is a Fortune 500 company with locations all over the world. I've gained invaluable knowledge in the financial field with this company.

good,I worked mostly evenings so we waited on work sometimes so we found things to do with our time.  We had a good time and learned a lot from each other.
good,"The people who are amongst peers are great people to work with, always willing to help each other out. Management in different departments vary, On Demand management has been wonderful and Card Services management needs improvement and they will see improvement in that department as a whole."
good,"I want to thank Fiserv for giving me a chance at a career change.  I was older and just out of school than the typical person applying for the job I got."
good,Its having nice experience to be working with Fiserv. Project are on new technologies and you will get the chance to work on them. good working environment.
good,Fiserv is a good place to work with good benefits.  I have learned a lot from my time here--and look forward to new challenges.
good,"Good night job while going to college but worked til 1-2 am. "
good,Productive. Generally a great place to work. I learned a lot about many different machines and had a very good rapport with all my fellow workers. There weren't too many difficulties at the job and I enjoyed the employee functions at Christmas time and so too the games and fun that went along with Employee Appreciation Week.
good,"I work for Fiserv for about 6  years and It was great. I have a wonderful co-workers we were like a family.  The hardest part of the job was when the business where kind of low they had to fire some and that makes us sad and tears in the eye because we were family.  the part that we enjoy its when the company recognize the effort or the employees.  because of the technology we have to learn new things, in the beginning was tough but worthy!!"
good,"Not much growth .Not much learning."
good,Great culture and overall great place to work. Minimal opportunity to advance to a new role or promotion which is driven by management.
good,"day at work Happy and busy,"
good,"I Enjoyed working at Fiserv and getting to know the people I worked with on a day to day basis. Pulling together to create ""one Fiserv"" atmosphere."

good,"Financial performance, opportunity and a transparent approach for customers. Opportunity comes as fast as you can handle it. Well run organization with outstanding solutions."
good,good place to work. i work for 5 years on this. training and job advancement was good. pay was ok. location was bad in the city.
good,"I was assigned at mailing inserting department"
good,Good job for someone with good customer service skills.  Can be stressful.  Work environment is pretty good as far as co-workers and management being supportive.  Getting compensated adequately can be an issue.
good,"Good Company to work. Enjoy working with Fiserv."
good,"Well defined tasks and assignments."
good,"Is a global company, and I worked with some great, knowledgeable people."
good,Fiserv is a good place to work for. It is just hard for me to find child care every Saturday and having both weekend days off in my department is not an option there.
good,"A typical day is split into two halves, one half of the day is providing tier two support to clients with issues and questions supporting their purchased product. "
good,"A typical day would include taking phone calls or answering e-mail questions in regards to their bill pay through their banks. Most of the management is always there is to answer questions and to give advice. Generally co-workers are very friendly, but of course there are some of them who do not have positive attitudes. The hardest part of the job is dealing with escalated situations where customers are upset. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are able to resolve a situation and the customer is very appreciative. Knowing you were able to assist a person and make them happy is a great feeling."
good,Design and developed new functionality. Learned about loose coupled application design.
good,The employer will not provide the training needed to the associates.
good,"I enjoyed the team that I worked with; however felt that some management could use additional management training. Fiserv tries to attempt a work / life balance; however sometimes work gets in the way. Job security is not there as every February there are layoffs; therefore employees are very nervous at the beginning of the year. Fiserv does well to attempt to compensate their employees should they fall behind the average norm. I did enjoy my work, but mostly all of my co-workers."
good,"The day would start with a quick workout in the employee gym zone "
good,"Fiserv is a good stepping stone for someone wanting to gain production experience. However, employees are put on mandated overtime  frequently and sometimes with less then 24 hour notice the there is barley any work/ life balance here. which drives most employee's away. I have enjoyed working with my co-workers and I have learned a lot from this company and gain a lot f knowledge and experience."
good,"This was a good job that I enjoyed doing.  I'm a technical person and I love computers and reading.  I excelled at this position and was always blowing away my coworkers in the productivity numbers. It was just horribly managed, which is why it went out of business.  "
good,This company has lot of products and it has various umbrella of catering various software.
good,"Working for Fiserv for the past 14 years for the most part was a great place to work. i think the worse part of the job was the hours. We worked from 5:00 am to 1:00pm. Fiserv was a check processing center so in the years that I worked there I learned alot about the banking business. Think that I enjoyed the most about working there is the people. The begining of each month was our busy time so we would hire temps for the first week, so i was able to meet and work with alot of different people."
good,"Learned the fraud prevention process for debit cards. Made and received calls regarding potential fraud. Hardest part of job is not being able to help people that have already been victims of fraud. Enjoyed the calls that allowed me to stop fraud in its tracks. Management is very supportive, and co-workers very friendly."
good,"I started as a customer service representative and had a few promotions and have learned many skills and have become very detailed oriented. There have been some changes in management and requires adjusting. Co-workers are great to work with and are team oriented. The hardest part of this job is trying to get support in order to perfom your duties and due to corporate decisions, unable to obtain it. The most enjoyable part is that I enjoy what I do and have very flexible hours."
good,Lots of objectives and difficult to keep up with forever changing targets. My direct peers and manager have been incredible however upper management (i.e Director) are out of touch with reality.
good,"Fiserv has evolved over the years.  I became a part of Fiserv via an acquisition, like many of the current employees.  Over the years, the company has transformed from a company of many separate business to one large company.  Overall, the experience has been very good, although there have many frequent manager changes and the future is a little uncertain with the recent First Data acquisition.  Good company to start with with lot of opportunities."
good,"The time here was pleasant.  There was lots of teamwork and dedication.  I grew great relationships with my clients over the years.  The team i had the pleasure of working with was great.  The teamwork actually made the department run smoothly, which made the day and the job that much easier."
good,"Business  hours. Learned about technology and data processing."
good,"Fiserv believes in 'Wellness' and fosters varied programs throughout the year as well as onsite programs through 'event teams' on almost a 'monthly' basis. Fiserv believes in various programs to reinforce associates security,"
good,I had no difficulties understanding the day to day operations when I started. The training was well done and in a professional manner. I'm currently still employed and excel at what I do.
good,It is a great company that will continue to be a frontrunner in its industry.  They strive to be the best and challenge their employees to achieve in ever increasing ways.
good,Can learn things lot from here.u will not get recognized for the work u had done.work life balance.but not to worry about the job security. You have to be more productive
good,Good place to work and explore your new skills. Depends from project to project for work load and life balance. But overall really good place to work.
good,I am very grateful for the career I had at Fiserv. I learned many things about management and character building. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with people and helping them achieve their goals.
good,"Fiserv has employee friendly policies."
good,"Company offered exposure to new ideas, techniques, processes.  However little budget for training  and company often reorganized management and departments so there was a lack of stability."
good,"Depends on ones personality as to how they will adapt. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, beautiful building.. fast paced location and a lot of traffic."
good,"I enjoyed the environment at Fiserv and their positive outlook for future improvements. Worked remotely, which was a nice benefit. "
good,"Worked a blue collar job in a white collar, snooty environment, but then again, it was a job in banking. Was a better job the more time passed, but all attempts to climb ladder were denied. AA was probably the culprit, but it's Atlanta, formerly the city too busy to hate, now the exact opposite. Great severance package when my section shuttered, so my exit was exponentially better than my tenure there. If experience in banking industry and you have friends in high places, or infinite charm, you've found a home..."
good,"If you really wanted to understand how insurance, banking and finance domain is working in US then this is the company to work, where you can really get good insights of the domain."
good,na. I have none. Only there for 9 months till dept closed. Great co-workers. Management relaxed. I am continueing because this page will not let me leave.
good,"-documentation of account activity "
good,"Flexibility to work remote 100%"
good,It was a good place to work and the people were mostly helpful but you would from time to time have to work with people who were not helpful and would not return calls.

good,"Decent pay, great benefits. Most of management was very friendly and professional."
good,"Worked with vairous teams on projects and our results were always on time and within buget ."
good,"Multiple Responsibilities in roles.  The Alpharetta location is a great place to work, awesome building, onsite cafe, state of the art facility with wellness center and gym"
good,I am kept busy with software installation and support.  Creative programming of an inventory system that I am responsible for. Position requires a fair amount of problem solving.
good,"Fiserv is a very good place to work. Great in fact. The management are easily accessible, the environment is fast paced but not grueling."
good,"There are lots of different areas to be trained in.  Mostly computer work and banking.  I learned all the ins and outs of working with the Bill Pay product.  Managers oversee Supervisors, who oversee a small group of employees.  Lots of one on one time weekly or bi-weekly.  Lots of opportunities to earn extra money.  Paid vacation is a set number of hrs that renews annually.  "
good,"Buys a lot of small companies that function independently"
good,"While I was with Fiserv in Agoura Hills, it was a great place to work. I was solely responsible for the commercial software product, so for the last 7 or so years I worked alone. There was some interface with the team working on the personal lines rating software."
good,"Value employees, job security, good package better than other IT."
good,The hours are I work are decent. if you enjoy sitting around talking on phones then this would be a wonderful job for someone. It is very fast paced and can be competitive at times. The dress code is business casual which i liked about the job seeing how it gave me the opportunity to dress how i wanted to.
good,"Enjoyed working with my fellow operation associates in delivering excellent service to the clients in check processing environment with emphasis in teamwork, quality and quantity."
good,"friendly coworkers "
good,I really enjoyed the pace of the work environment and how management was on the same page when it came to policies and core values. The call volume wasn't too bad and I love that the company was open 24hrs.
good,Fiserv was a great technical support position.  There was a lot to learn at the time.  It was my first technical support position and there was a lot to learn.  This was the busiest call center I've ever worked in.  There were some extremely stressful work day.
good,"Must be a ""yes-man"" to move up the ladder.  Great benefits; fair pay. Look out for yourself. Ability to work from home is nice. Hard to adapt if you come in to their atmosphere from an acquired company."
good,The typical day is structured to focus on current requirements for project.  Opportunities for continued learning in areas of development that will help grow and improve efficiency in position.  Currently going through a process to adjust work force to deliver a streamline business force as technical changes occur.
good,"Great place to work, many opportunities to expand skill set and knowledge base.  Excellent benefit is the ability to work from home sometimes.  Has provided experience with many operating systems, Windows, Unix/AIX, and Linux.  Also has provided experience with networking, change management, ITIL shop, SAN storage, and PCI audits.  Our business unit has been combined into the larger organization, which provides a vast amount of opportunities for career advancement.  Also, the companies market value has grown extensively in the last 6 years."
good,"It is really an Awesome company to work with. Almost been with this company for last 10 years and enjoy every year of it. "
good,"nice enviroment to work in and a lot of opportunities to move up in the company. Pay is decent and are flexible with schedule, would recommend job to anyone"
good,"Fiserv is continually one of the worlds most admired companies and very much profitable given their decades of exceeding earnings forecasts.  The company focuses on job work / life balance which is a breath of fresh air.  Unfortunately, the salary compensation is not competitive amongst its peers."
good,"Good place to work i have been there for 2 years. Treat contractors much same as they do employees. They are acquiring companies alot which creates turmoil and they going through technology growth and consolidation. It is very challenging place to work but great group of people, friendly and professional environment."
good,"When I started working at Fiserv it was called EPSIIA a small company that was bought by Fiserv. We specialized in electronic document delivery solutions. We had a software suite and additional services that were sold to financial institutions and health card companies. Over the years we were slowly assimilated into the more corporate culture of Fiserv and the teamwork feel seemed to be discouraged as the departments became more defined. We went through several reorganizations and had allot of upper management turnover which set us on a path of consistent crisis management rather than the team innovation and problem solving from the early years. In my last 2 years at the job, Fiserv (in Austin) had stopped back filling positions due to separations and people leaving for new jobs. This created (in my opinion) a highly stressful and disruptive atmosphere because of the pressure to continue growing our output and on boarding but with fewer people. The solution to some of this was the addition of software tools, some of which were useful and others were not. Before I left the company there seemed to be a big push and investment in the data center. I left on very good terms it was not easy to leave but having been with Fiserv for so long I needed a change and to take a little time off to think about the next stage of my career."
good,"Fiserv is a very good place to work.  They care about the employees and provide opportunity to advance.  The work/life balance is great, and all the people are very nice."
good,"A typical day would be sorting e-mails, checking and fixing job bombs. Updating senior management on long standing issues. Diagnosing error codes. Escalting issues to appropriate teams. Giving a daily status report to next shift and senior team members. "
good,"a lot of support, managers assist with career development and leaderships makes associates feel valued as part of the team"
good,Great place to work. Lots to learn. Billing System is SAP but is very user friendly and co-workers are great. You will have long days and is hard work.
good,Great people to work with. Work life balance was good.  And they provided food subsidy which was nice. Focused on innovation and improvement. I would go back.
good,"Fiserv must be a pretty good company to work for because I am a rehire. I like the fact that Fiserv allows its associates to work from home a minimum of 2 days per week and they supplied all of the necessary items (laptop, monitor, keyboard, mouse, docking station) to make you at home work station condusive to a good working environment."
good,Gained very invaluable insight to the small Credit Unions processes for daily functionality.  The most enjoyable part of the job...I enjoyed the pace at which I was able to work and had my own laptop. Had the opportunity to work remotely from home if wanted to.  I enjoyed selecting cases that I felt were somewhat easy that I could handle in order to meet my goal of 10-12 cases closed per day.
good,"Being a introductory place of work, it was a good place to start.  Everyone is very friendly and will work with you in the best way that they can.  Sometimes it can get hectic, but when everyone works together it makes it all the more bearable."
good,What I love about this job is the workplace friendly . Everyday I give my best and everyone else around it !! The leads are awesome and are always willing to help you .
good,There was lot of team work in the Billing Department. My colleagues made the role enjoyable.  Management decisions complicated our work load but we achieved our goals because of the strong team work and shared work ethic.
good,"Good work life balance. Lots of opportunity to learn new stuff. "
good,"A great environment but it is very mind numbing and repetitive and sometimes too easy. The pay is decent for a college student but not ideal for when you need to come home and study afterward. Management is great, and they were very flexible and will compensate if you have other engagements. There is a lot of information to be learned, but anyone is capable and everything falls into a rhythm once you can get the hang of it."
good,"-Provide services to incoming calls or emails from customers, sales and account management to resolve customer questions & concerns"
good,Fiserv was a great job that kept me on my toes.  It was a fast paced environment with daily quotas and deadlines.  I enjoyed the teamwork needed to make the daily deadlines.
good,Great company to work for.   The benefits and managers are great and appreciate a work life balance.  The job culture is easy to adjust to and employees are easy to get along with.  Facilities are well kept and easy to navigate.
good,"I get to the Office at 7 O'clock. After swiping my I D Card, I go to the Office and straight to my department. I tidy up my table and offer prayers to God to protect me and any colleagues throughout the day. I then check my schedule to see if I have any outstanding work from the previous day and complete them."
good,"Good work culture in Fiserv US, not in Fiserv India. Good work life balance in the US, good people and talent around in the company."
good,"A good company to work with. Good professional work environment."
good,"Pros"
good,My experience was quite good. People can maintain good work-life balance.
good,"Like any other place of business, there are some really good people doing realy good work and some other people who are just a waste of time and space making things harder. Coworkers are a pleasure and what makes it worthwhile everyday. Management is typically underqualified and lacking leadership. While I enjoy working here, I would not recommend it to a friend or family member."
good,"Fiserv provides many opportunities for associates to work remotely and travel to client locations.  The company is challenging in that it has grown through acquisition and many different business units still had their own way of running the business that, at times, was not conducive to the way other business units in the same product implementations managed.  Just made for a more interesting opportunity to lead more than anything.  The company provides a great deal of on-going training and communicates with associates frequently.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with clients face-to-face.  The most difficult part of the job was working to change processes across the enterprise.  Although mandated by senior management the support for this change from senior management was lacking on an on-going basis.  However, I would recommend this comapny and would gladly return if the circumsatnces were favorable to do in the future."
good,Good mix of technology and culture.  Management more worried about the billable rate than over all customer satisfaction.
good,Typical Call Center life. With ever-changing processes and ways of operating. The culture is great with positive upbeat agents and mangers.
good,"Nice place to work, flexible work-life balance. Full management support."
good,Great coworkers and management!! I learned a great deal working at Fiserv and I learned a great about back-end management of file processing.
good,This job was about 65% travel to various cities to assist new banks with understanding the new system that they were now converted to.  The in office time was converting all of their previous data into the new system information and balancing such to the date of conversion.  I learned  a very in depth knowledge of a processing system that I had worked with for years.  Management was adequate and I enjoyed my co workers.  The hardest part of the job was the details of the conversion balancing as there was no room for error.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction of seeing the new bank personnel grasp the new system and the show of their appreciation.
good,Overall a great job; enjoyed the people I worked for as well as my peers and subordinates.  There was nothing hard about the job because I enjoyed the challenges and appreciated the accomplishments.  Was given many opportunities to learn and continue developing my skills as a manager.   I was able to maintain a good working relationship with all levels of management as well as my peers and subordinates.  Thankful for the opportunity they provided me but now I look forward to moving on and using the knowledge learned in my next career opportunity.
good,"Salary is not the best, but the management are pretty good and they threat their associates with respect.  "
good,"Met some very knowledgeable individuals, and very easy laid back environment"
good,"i liked the job, it was just too many angry people. I liked the cafe they had there it was very convenient,"
good,Assisted Wells Fargo customers with their online billpay discrepancies. Learned how the banking and online billpay system worked. I made many friends with coworkers. Management was hit or miss. Some managers were really good and some were not as good as others.
good,"My Fiserv center was a great place to work. I loved interacting with our customers and miss the way our departments woked together. If not for the center closing, I would have stayed until I was old and gray."
good,Fun place to work. Good management. good work and life balance
good,Fiserv is a great place to work. I login from home and do my job with very few remote issues. My boss is very encouraging and flexible and the team works well together (all remote).
good,"Whether your customers are paying in person or online, our solutions allow you to maximize the potential of electronic payment processing. For instance."
good,Fiserv has a great family easy going atmosphere. It was a fun experience to work for the company. They supplied everything they can to ensure you are not to stressed at work.
good,"It isn't so bad, the work you have to do is easy along with all the benefits they provide, both financially as well as inclusively. Here, I learned how to handle any situation in a stressful environment and how to assist and provide a positive customer experience. The management is motivational, in that they like to see you succeed, and the people that you work with give you a reason to come to work with a smile on your face."
good,Lots of change going on with a major merger in 2019 which doubled the size of the company. They have a good industry brand and are #fiservproud. It is a collaborative environment.
good,"It is an excellent company which has given me a lot of good experience and opportunities to perform."
good,It's a good job if you can handle the stress. You get cussed and yelled at by customers and the company nit picks your calls all the time. You get graded like you are in school and you get your name put on the board.
good,Its overall a great place to work. Just doesnt pay quite enough. The people are great. The work is easy and fast paced. Really keeps you busy except for slow days.
good,"Benefits are great, management is really engaged and there is always change. The only thing that needs improvement is training and internal advancement."
good,It’s very nice teamwork and management very good I learned to many things that’s but me in good position I learned how we work as a team hoe we fixing problems and issues in the computers.
good,Very nice and dent place...well organized place and excellent environment our workers are good looking and well experienced works with good skills and the company is fast growing.
good,"My job give me a lot of flexibility to complete my task without much oversight from management. "
good,"Fast paced. Heavy work load. Good training and great people"
good,"I have worked for the company for about 3 years. The pay is decent and my boss is amazing. You need to know how to multitask such as responding to email throughout the day, taking calls and making outbound calls, and working cases that come through. Position I am in is light technical support for example troubleshooting and researching member/client issues."
good,I enjoyed my job with Fiserv which had a lot of running around which it kept me active and going all the time. My manager was awesome as he was very flexible with me on what I want to do and lay back person.
good,Good company to work.however very slow in adapting new changes to technology. The company provides financial services to the banks of usa. Good balance between work and life.
good,"If the reader enjoys high stress environments, a call center job is likely for them. Fiserv in particular, was very fast paced and stressful, but the benefits made up for that."
good,The pros of working with this company is that it is a lot of opportunity within the company to grow.  The cons is there are so many moving parts to the company and clients expect you to know every one of them.
good,"Fiserv overall is amazing but there is little continuity between business units. I have worked for multiple products within the corporation, the first position I held for 4 years and have nothing negative to say about. There was a great collaborative effort between employees and we worked hard but were given amazing training and support. The current business unit I am in is the complete opposite. Very little training available for the product. No support when there are questions and concerns with the work we are to do. Management is difficult to get ahold of and will regularly cancel meetings because they are pulled in so many different directions.  They are not collaborative yet have multiple upper managers giving conflicting opinions as to how the work should be done.  It is not the “Fiserv” culture that we had in my previous product."
good,"Will pay for most training."
good,"Job Security, Good people, Good management."
good,"Good work environment. Great pay. Pay for back office is $16hr. Flex time work schedule. Basically, you don't have a schedule except for be at work by 9a and work a 8hr shift and you're not late. Lunch is also flex time which is between 30 minutes to 2 hours."
good,Fiserv was the usual check processing environment at the time. This was before the electronic transaction culture so the number of checks processed daily was high
good,"Fiserv was a great company to work for; however the division I worked for was divested from the company."
good,"I enjoyed working for Fiserv. The company moved to North Carolina and I was unable to relocate. If they would have remained in Illinois, I would still be working there."
good,Is a good and reliable please to work regardless of cultural differences. There is also a good team work among the workers. This encourages the production to be maximized
good,"Really enjoyed my time at Fiserv, unfortunately I had to leave since my spouse accepted a position out of state and it cut my time with the company short."
good,"Fiserv provide me the opportunity to get a lot of knowledge, not only on the technical field, also on Management."
good,"Typical day was answering phones and researching why cards or ATMs are not working.  "
good,"Good Company to work with."
good,"I was on contract at this company, good environment for working, had extensive training with different process and procedures,was not new to most of the loan processing systems,"
good,"This is a company with a great product/service that many people use. The servicing of the product is executed very well. While many of the positions are call center related, there are opportunities to work in other areas of the company and to grow. Most of the people are friendly. The dress code is mostly jeans and t-shirts. There are opportunities for improvement in various processes. However, once a decision is made to make improvements, this company will be great."
good,"I am happy to work with Fiserv, Work life balance is more.Once can get very good business knowledge. The work you done definitely appreciated. Nice to work in this organization."
good,This position is great. I have the option to work from home. Management has great people. Only take away is that it is that policy and procedures are not documented and structured enough. You seem to have to wing it a lot.
good,"A great company to be with if you are looking for a company to stay with. There are always movement opportunities. Most areas of business are great to work in. There are a few that can be stressful and maybe even feel dead end, but moving between lines of business is always a possibility."
good,It was a good experience working with Fiserv. I learned many new things and its a good place to work. The management is good and responsible and colleagues were friendly.
good,"I worked for Open Solutions which is acquired by Fiserv, I find the company as a good pay master initially, During Open Solution time the management is not so great so as the culture."
good,"Nice work life balance"
good,"Workplace culture was very relaxed back when I was working with Fiserv."
good,"My boss fired people often. I'm always afraid i'm going to get fired. The team I worked with were great people. I learned a lot about data security, but I always fear i'm going to lose my job. Living in fear is no way to live."
good,"It has been a great place to work, the people are kind. The cafe is incredibly nice. The hardest part of my job has been getting a set schedule and finding a shift I like."
good,good employer to start your IT career at. CEO is succeeding at making one company by centralizing all business units rather than each business unit acting on their own.
good,"Great company to work for, Management is good, Co-workers are good, Team work is the essence.You love working for this company. "
good,"Fun workplace and gives a great learning curve. "
good,"Its a good place to learn and equally maintain work life balance."
good,"Much depends on your direct manager and Fiserv really emphasizes building strong direct relationships."

good,The managers are available when there is any issues regarding customer's needs. Great place to work and people are very nice.
good,Had a great learning experience at Fiserv. The co-workers are friendly and respond to any questions that you might have. The management is also concerned with the advancement of the employee and see to it that they are exposed to higher management.
good,Worked for Acumen which has client as credit Unions of US and CA. I got good exposure to banking domain. I was working for EFT i.e electronics Fund Transfer module there. I was overall good learning.
good,Nice to work with... Product company.. You get to work on good stuff.. Had to leave because of family.. otherwise I would have never left it
good,"- welcoming management"
good,"A typical day consists of around 5 hours of phone support and 3 hours of case study, follow up, personal training, scheduled training, and meetings. Management has a great attitude about work and the culture is very friendly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with clients on a daily basis, so if you are a people person than this is the job for you! Off shift work is required, meaning you work a different schedule than normal about once a month."
good,"Fast paced environment. I have had the opportunity to learn and work in various types of customer service related departments. Phones, card services, research and credit returns."
good,"I take an average of 100 calls a day, I have to be able to multitask to be able to complete a phone call, fill out a report all the while listening and answering any questions my customer may have.  My atmosphere is fun and enjoyable and I love working with my co-workers.  They help to make a potential highly stressful situation into  a more interesting one."
good,"A typical workday would start with getting all our clients to send their work in early so that we can start processing it asap."
good,The managers in other departments were not very engaging and open to assist other departments which made it very challenging to complete some tasks.
good,Sometimes provide the opportunity to work from home. Great company overall. Nice environment. Enjoyed working with this company. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,"My working experience at this Financial Service was great."
good,"* On calls all day with customers who have confirmed fraudulent activity on there card"
good,"Planning and implementing changes related with System,Storage"
good,Fiserv is a great place that will allow you to learn new task as well as advance within. You will be allowed to really expand you knowledge here.
good,"Taking cares from auto loan/leasing customers. "
good,"Great management, but can be a stressful work environment, must have patience and good customer service skills."
good,"This is a good product development and services organization. Given its small size, professionals get exposure to various processes and tools."
good,"Typical day consisted of downloading thousands of employee's insurances information and/or change employee's coverage. Running reports, investigating all system issues, and provide information to Clients regarding their accounts. Learning and understanding new system applications. Co-workers were very helpful and knowledgeable about different systems applications.  Hardest part...when one systems had technical problems it effective all other systems. I had to wait for IT to solve problem and I had to wait to access my accounts to complete transactions on time. Enjoyable part...learning new job skills."
good,"nice place to work,good benefits, the co. is in Ohio.up and coming field to grow in."
good,"Here I have learned lot of new things in my technology."
good,A fun and productive place to work. One where my intellectual input is valued.
good,Process mortgages or title work .. learned alot about titles an escrows great group of people to work with the hardest part of working at this company was the constant moving from dept to dept. when the bottom fell out of the mortgage industry.
good,Nice to company to work with. Very open work culture and provides opportunity to work on latest payment channels.
good,Diverse organization with the ability to move into different roles and areas for individuals with the drive and initiative.
good,"Lots of different personalities, which made it a diverse place to work. All my superiors were great. I was an Item Processor, which meant I 10 keyed my life away... what more could you ask for?? Unfortunately my whole department was outsourced, otherwise id still be working there."
good,"I like working at Fiserv. Have a few issue with the hours that I work."
good,"Working at Bank of America provided me with various skills, from multi-tasking to being detail oriented. My co-workers were a joy to work with who were very supportive and always provided the knowledge they had regarding the job. Management had an open door policy which really made the work environment more relaxed. The hardest part of the job was being able to determine if you were speaking with a fraud perp or the actual customer."
good,I just wish I wasnt hired through temp service I really want to stay.
good,I enjoyed my time at Fiserv. The company will be tight with funds when it shouldn't be but overall a good company.
good,"Worked at Fiserv as a contractor for the Fiserv ETG BU. I liked working there, the team i worked on was fantastic. I would still be there if my contract was able to be extended or go perm. Fiserv is a very process heavy environment. Lots of red tape. I am process oriented person so I didn't mind too much, but this might be take some getting used to. could take 3-6 months from submitting a purchase request to adding a new ESXi server to a cluster. On site cafeteria, decent food, nice campus. Right next to East Jones bridge park and the river. I have made any friends there and will miss it. I would def entertain a chance to come back. I rated job security low because from a contractor stand point, employment is never 100%, but FTE status is little more solid. Good stock option plan, Health benefits from what I hear aren't that good. My contract wasn't able to be extended not by choice but by situations outside my manager's hands. However, he was really cool and gave me a heads up where I can start my job hunt ahead of my end date."
good,"Fiserv , truly exemplified the fine balance of Work and Fun."
good,"I work third shift so I do a lot of mulit-tasking. I take phone calls and work on cases at the same time. So I am learning a great skill there. I encounter different cardholders everyday, some easy to get along with some not so easy, but that is expected in customer service. Overall its a really nice place to work."
good,"There were challenges every day. Team work was phenomenal. Management had focus and direction and assisted subordinates when needed. Most co-workers welcomed team work. The hardest part of the job was troubleshooting non-Fiserv application issues with customer environments. We for one would assist the customer with their environment where other vendors would leave it at ""Our software is working correctly"". In most cases, an upgrade was performed that affected Fiserv applications as well as non-Fiserv applications. The most enjoyable part was when the issue was corrected."
good,The company expects the consultants to think on their feet while supporting and consulting to the Fiserv customers. They always provided technical support to the individual consultant.
good,This company is extremely big on communcation flowing in both directions from the CEO down and from the new hires up.
good,Always busy and everyone pitches in to get the jobs done. Good benefits
good,"i enjoyed working for Fiserv. Through my dedication and teamwork over the years of my employment, I was promoted 4 times. I started as a Receptionist, move to Product Distribution, Customer Services Product Specialist II and left as an Inside Sales Representative. I feel I was treated very well there and my hard work paid off."
good,I enjoyed my long 10 years with this company and will continue to do so.
good,"Excellent management. Loved working for Fiserv, management was exceptional."
good,"Good Place to work."
good,"I learnt a lot about banking system. Created a lot of customized applications for banks and was involved in bank mergers and conversions."
good,"This company promotes a good work life balance."
good,I loved working at Fiserv. Every day was different (most of the time I worked in support capacities to the sourcing organization. I had lots of chances to grow and learn in different jobs. After the merger the company had a very different feel - maybe it's too soon  to tell.
good,Good place to work with great employee perks. I learned a lot here about the banking and finance industry. The people are amazing to work with. The management is ok
good,"good in Analyze Science, Engineering, Business and other data processing problems and implement solutions to improve computer systems. "
good,"I had the best managers possible. They trained you properly and to the culture of Fiserv. I had no complaints, other than the pay. If Fiserv paid more for the amount of work they have you do, it would be the PERFECT employer to work for and I would NEVER have left. The work/life balance is not very balanced. In my workgroup CUS, it's nothing for you to work 10 or more hours a day. Easily. But the trade off is worth it. The amount of real world experience you gain is unprecedented in today's cyber/Information security work experience. You would almost have to pay TOP DOLLAR at a school to get this type of experience and still would not get in 6 months to a years worth of classroom training what I got in on the job experience. NO certification can prepare you for what I received at Fiserv and I'm grateful for it"

The team we had was one if not the best team we had on the floor, thanks to our Supervisor who helped us believe we could take care of any given task. It also helped we had team gatherings involving food and fun on a weekly basis."
good,"This was an excellent job.  I started right out of high school.  I was trained on the job and was able to function relatively confidently by the end of the second month.  However I only worked two days a week and someone working full-time would likely learn more quickly.    I worked 12 hour days on the weekend and it was very hard on my feet coming straight for a sedentary school life.  The pay was good, but nothing you could comfortably support a family on.  A great job for a single person or someone whose partner has a better job.  The supervisor on card side was wonderful, but I'd heard bad things about the supervisor on print side.  The leads varied.  Some were nice but lax and others were effective but a bit grumpy.  The culture was pretty dull.  Gossipy, but friendly enough.  Working in pods meant that you usually kept to yourself.  Very low stress job."

good,"Fiserv is a third party payment processor, so it’s in the business of acquiring other lock boxes. However with everything going digital, the workflow is declining. As with any workplace, you’ve got lazy associates, competitive associates, and authoritative leaders. But overall, the culture actually benefits employees, but not necessarily temps. Beware temps is the way in, but it’s only chance if you are converted."

I was also able to work my own schedule and as long as I was responsive to customer needs and anticipated what needed to be completed or initiated--I was basically self-managed. However, it is a 24/7 job. So work/life balance was hard, so you had to make the most of it when you are off work. Strong management."

good,The job was very easy except for the machine breaking down. Loved the fact that you could enjoy snacks on the warehouse floor. work was a little scarce because I worked the weekend shift. Also probably why I didnt have such a bad experience I only worked for 2 days a week and got paid by the temp service every week. You get paid every 2 weeks if you get hired on
good,"During my 30 years with Fiserv, my primary roles were in technical support and check processing. In both areas, quality, large volume transaction processing was required. The most challenging and rewarding services I performed involved large scale volume and process related analyses.

I'm sure I would have outperformed my actual performance had my health issues been properly handled. Overall, the camaraderie is good, the cooperation among employees is good, and management's willingness to listen to employee issues and help resolve employee difficulties is good.  Also, while it is not listed among employee benefits, their emergency employee assistance is available to all workers regardless of shift times, and management are willing to work with employees to help them through emergencies effecting their job."

good,"No matter how long you've been there, you always learn new things every day. Team work as well as individual initiative is the norm and it's rewarding to be appreciated by your peers and see them using tools or information that you provided. Management actually listens and the hardest part of the job is constant interruptions and last minute date changes on deliverables. The most enjoyable part of the job is the psychological victory of completing so many tasks each day whether through the ticketing system they measure performance by or from phone calls and IM text messages."
