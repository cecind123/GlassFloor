rating,review
bad,"No regard for personal life. Poorly trained management evolved into poor workmanship. Terrible experience working production for this company, Don't recommend it."
bad,Was working 7 days a week since October.  Fell last week at work HR said to take 5 days off to heal back.  Went back to work and now fired for not calling in those 5 days.
bad,this job is great if your single and have no life. the shift starts to early i was getting up 0230 the culture is about the mighty dollar no regaurd for the employee
bad,Weak place to advance. Hourly won't get promoted to salary.
bad,"A typical day consisted of order entry, fax prices to sales reps, answer phones, send and receive mail, email all day, among a constant need from the sales team to do the work that they could do. I learned that the company allows the sales reps to do as little admin as possible.My management was absent the majority of the time. My co-workers were mediocre at best when it comes to knowing how to enter claims and orders as well as replying to emails. The hardest part of my job was that I had to do an extensive amount of work for the office with no compensation for my hard work.The most enjoyable part of the day for me was going home."
bad,"You have no life out of work. Management calls and harass you when you call in due to no travel advised in the winter. It pays the bills, but that’s it."
bad,long hrs `5 hr days 7 days a week no home life. sure pay is  decent but no time to spend it! management sucks and will drop u on a dime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,Non competitive pay. Will hire anybody off the streets to work here.  Huge language barrier problem. Management gets unlimited vacations while employees are working 6-7 day wks. Maintenance dept gets $5 hr raise and refuses to fix eqmt as management pushes to go faster. New management constantly. High turnover rate. Place needs a complete overhaul. Here cuz it pays the bills.
bad,The place hired to many family and friends to work for them. This made it very uncomfortable to do anything. Because you sooner or later you where getting called in to the office.
bad,"This office loses numerous admin. and sales workers because of poor management. It may be good at the corporate office, it is not a good place to work on Holiday Drive. There are several of us that will stay a short time and we do not plan on making Hormel Foods our career of choice."
bad,"The only people the management here tries to lift up is themselves."
bad,"The second shift line lead has no redeemable qualities, this person is hard to work under, you never know what you’re gonna get, Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hide. It’s hard to speak to her about anything. They are very greedy, they don’t give much of any holiday time off while other factories give their employees 2-3 days for Thanksgiving and Christmas, we get one. We are not appreciated, not respected, they work us until we’re exhausted and give us no time to recuperate. There are things I like and respect about the business but the bad outweighs the good."
bad,"I deleted this once thinking I was to harsh but it’s an honest review and I added a bit.. Hormel pays well but you are there a minimum of 50 hours a week. They have great benifits if you can handle staying there long enough for them to kick in. You never know if you are going home on time or staying until who knows when. Management is vague at best and never know how much there is to get done. (I don’t believe that one bit they just lie to your face)Then they act like time and a half is this big deal and you should be grateful to work 50+ hours. It’s mostly spanish speaking in production,  so if you don’t speak Spanish expect to be ostracized, confused, and have an insane amount of anxiety. Like to the point you will probably need meds to control it. If you get hurt don’t expect to fill an accident report out because your supervisor will brush you off and be condescending  about everything knowing they can get away with it because who are you going to report them too HR? They are all in it together. The communication at this company is literally non existent and it shows by the lack of training even leads and sups get. If you are on the line prepare to learn to work on million dollar equipment with little to no training. Yes you will cut yourself, yes you will burn yourself, and of course yes like I stated nobody cares as long as you don’t bleed in the products. Even then it’s questionable..Anyone who has been there a few years (not many because most have walked out) say it’s gone downhill and people leave almost as fast as they are hired. The environment is chaotic on an average"
bad,The job itself is not bad but the management is very terrible they don't like people to speak up and my job is to speak up as a quality control auditor if they don't like you they will harass and blackballed you till you leave or they build a case to fire you. Hard to have a life outside of work.
bad,Might be the worst place I ever worked !!!! Can get held for up to15 hours at anytime without notice. You have to ask to use the bathroom and manager treat employees like children.
bad,"Great people, very conservative culture.  Tough to be an outsider, lots of turf to be protected.  Start in sales work your way through the organization, starting in the middle fosters potential for resistance to new outside ideas.  If you like top down leadership this company will be good for you"
bad,This company has new executives that have little regard for their employees.  Do not work for this company   Poor leadership.  Many employees are leaving.  No new product innovation
bad,"Pay and benefits were ok, was the only thing that kept me there for as long as I did. Bad managers at the plant, my direct supervisor was especially incompetent. He couldn't make a decision to save his life and felt very threatened if you knew more than he did or contradicted him in any way. As far as advancement goes, good luck. You have to either know someone, blow someone, or just be an out right sycophant in order to advance....good old boy mentality is alive and well at Hormel Foods. Hormel always brags about how good the work/life balance is, but in actuality it is not good at all....work 60+ hours a week, 35+ weekends out of the year, and get harassed when you try to take some time off."
bad,The hr is a real corporate bi+$&. Management is poor. Horrible turnover rate. Low pay for the area. No life except work. Vacation is when concient for the company. Good starting job but don't stay. Pella corp Vermeer weilers hy vee and 3m all pay at least 2 dollars more an hour. Get out now
bad,"The Beloit plant needs to be revised. Management are rude and disrespectful, especially to the new hires. They have a high turn over rate due to people being mistreated."
bad,Maybe the plant working environment is better. When I worked for them in the corp. office it was horrible. The people are rude and they will lie about your character to get to terminated if you don't kiss their butts.
bad,Hormel reguires manditory overtime with no exceptions. It also lacks professionalism in training and managing of employees.
bad,"Work 6 days+ a week, forced overtime hours up to 15. Not told about it till your almost ready to go home. No sick days or personal days off. Benefits are normal, nothing to be impressed with."
bad,"Hormel Foods it's a good brand."
bad,Management uses intimidation to push you as hard as they can. There is no personal days or sick time. They will not let you break up vacations to cover any time off and they have a very tight point system.
bad,Great group of people to work with. Fast paced environment. Co-workers worked together wonderfully though company morale was sometimes on the low side at times. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with wonderful staff and the hardest part was putting up with occasional bad odors from the manufacturing plant.
bad,"You never know if you're working a weekend until the a night or two before, I could never make plans for a weekend.  If I didn't work at least 4 hours, they wouldn't pay me even though it was mandatory to come in on the weekend.  (Union employees were guaranteed 4 hours).  First shift works 8 hours but second shift could work anywhere from 8-12 hours to finish up.  First shift never finished half as much work as second shift because they always got to go home at 8 hours regardless of how fast they worked.  Unacceptable culture and upper management promotes it!"
bad,"If your Hispanic or Black you will be fine. If your white you will have a different set of rules. Used to be a great place to work, I absolutely loved it. Then they started to hire more and more immigrant s. They definitely favor them."
bad,"Job is steady and secure, corporate structure but be prepared for Long work hours/ Long work weeks/ Little pay/very little time for family or social life."
bad,"Management is a big problem, but not all. They work you to the last drop of sweat. They change your schedule and make you work very long hours. Management always trying to fire people."
bad,with all the hours you work you can earn a check.. but your life is non existent outside of work.. Very divided in who runs the upper management vs who works the actual jobs.
bad,I felt that they weren't understanding of single mother obligations outside of work.  they would do the very minimum that was required by law and other then that we had to just figure it out.
bad,Came into work at 5 am and didn't get out until after 5 pm and was expected to work most of my days off giving no work life balance and it is even worse on the night shift as they are so short handed all the time. Management likes to micro manage or just flat out make fun of their employees in front or behind their backs. Only good thing about them is that they pay well.
bad,"When your new you will work up to 16hrs daily. They do not give you notice to hold you over. Supervisors are belligerent, bully you and just care about numbers no matter what the cost. Workers are treated like numbers. Human resources should not even exist there. You cannot go in there without getting a third degree. Human resources should be there and available for employees to talk or with simple questions. Long term knowledgeable employees get treated unfairly."
bad,"You get all the benefits you could ask for, but management lack in communication, and Union Stewards don't do anything. Back breaking repetitive work. You will have to be there 5+ years to come close to the job you desire. Nearly everybody starts in Hog Processing. Most new hire's don't make it more than a month before they are tired of the place."
bad,Does not care how long they work you in a day and only give you 8 hours in between for rest. Management communicated poorly to each other and just did not care about employees.
bad,not good bad management long mandatory hours just overall don't like   fast turn around  rate new hires  a lot of quitting not a company to work for if have family
bad,"The company offers a great compensation and benefits package.  However, workplace diversity and work-life balance are awful.  Because I worked in quality, I was not one of the most well-liked employees.  My responsibilities sometimes cost the company time and money."
bad,"Overall, Hormel is fast paced and my co-workers were fun to work with.  However, the focus was solely on production, which made it difficult to work on other aspects.  Promotions were also based on seniority so it was difficult to move up the ladder no matter the performance."
bad,"I would only recommend this place to people who want to work 7 days a week. I was told during the interview that there was only a little bit of overtime. After I was employed, my first week was 6 days. Then after that it was 7 days a week for the next two months. Absolutely no work/life balance. They have far too much work for current staffing. Very high turnover rate."
bad,"I was surprised at how much each location differs.  If you like your current plant, stay put.  Also, if you are friends with the higher ups you will go far in this company."
bad,"Compensation is terrific, but you have no life outside of work.  Management treats you like a number and not a person.  I would suggest working here for a year and then going to a better company."
bad,"Typical day would start out preparing the days inventory, numbers of containers to fill,products to source out, operating computers & scales to weigh products,prepping ship out totes ,constantly monitoring products, alot of mathematical problem solving meaning adding & subtracting of weighted finished products."
bad,"I had no social life while I worked for hormel, quotas were impossible to meet to actually make bonus, it is a white-mans conservative company and always will be"
bad,The company sold to another co.pany so my job will be dicontinued. I have nothing bad to say. This new company is changing it to kill and cut only. They sold the company and did not have any answers for us employees.
bad,"I started off as packing the meat into their casings. When I went to days after 5 years then I would box, label and palatalize boxes. I could also use a fork truck to move racks full of meat or move them to clean them."
bad,"Some plants are better, others are worse. All are vary long hours. Constant squeeze to have salaried work more and be accountable for the mistakes of others."
bad,"I thought i would eventually work full time. I pulled my work load,was a great team player,and was always there on time. Unfortunately the work load slowed down and people were laid off,i was one of them."
bad,Those individuals that put forth a lot of effort and time are rewarded in some manner. While others put forth minimal effort and continue with the company of many years. Your performance impacts your pay but for those that provide the minimum there is no motivation to do more.
bad,"If you are in management, you have to move in order to advance your career. If you are not salaried, good luck getting promoted or advancing your career.  Culture is better than you'd expect for the industry, lots of events paid for by the company, and you are rewarded for doing well at your job. The hardest part of the job is the politics; the best part is the people."
good,"Working 7 days a week have little family time.  Worked like crazy, was problems from shift to shift.   Always complaining about each other.  Working overnights. Not always supervisors to ask questions to"
good,"In the beginning this company was a joy to work for, but in the last 2 years the joy has turned to fear. Fear the doors would be locked and or you would lose your job. No one feels secure in their position. This is from the degreed professional to entry level clerk. There is no trust in the current management team."
good,"We clock in, get your invoices, start up your old truck. Air builds and light checks. Let the truck warm up, Then head out.  During winter months, there's always deliveries to make.  During the summer, you grind tanks and paint them."
good,The company is great the pay is always correct the work isn't hard once trained. The supervisors make this place hard. It is a union based company and could get hard sometimes.
good,"everybody was out for themselves and nobody wanted to lend a helping hand to people in struggle. there was a lot diverse people there as well, which made it hard to communicate well"
good,The job was okay. It became boring and it felt like you don't have a life do to the demands of mandatory weekend hrs. So that left no time to spend with your family or friends.
good,Hormel food makes great products and customer love the product the only down fall to Hormel is they have become discriminate toward anyone over age 60.
good,"The people you worked with were satisfactory, but management could have trained people in their specific jobs. There were times you were put on a job, but didn't know what the expectations were.  I learned to stick up for myself and not let management walk all over me. I learned that no matter who you are you aren't any better than anyone else, no matter the title. I would not recommend this job if you are looking to move up in a security career. If you want something to pay the bills for a while, this may be a temporary fix. Working as a flex officer would give you higher pay and more hours. The hours are not ideal because you could go from a day shift to a night shift, to a evening shift. It's difficult to get a sleep schedule. If you want the best schedule and least busy, go for an evening shift."
good,New management required lots of overtime and very few weekends off. Typically worked six to seven days a week.Thirty minute lunch breaks  Fast paced production environment.
good,I wouldn't reccomend it but it pays the bills. After 11 years treat you like your a nobody and easy replaceable very sad after you invest so much time helping the company grow and take your knowledge of the plant for granted
good,People were nice there it just felt like management didn’t care about your home time or your life outside of work. It’s ok if you don’t have any kids but they are always making you work long overtime hours and double shifts without telling you. They will tell you the last 15-20 mins before you go home that you have to stay until they find someone else to replace you and they never find people to replace you. It’s like you live there
good,It was a good position but it was during 2nd shift and was hard to have a good work/life balance. It was a decent pay for the city that I live in but it wasn't enough to provide for family.
good,They expect you to do what ever you have to do for them to make there money. The only time you are able to do the right thing is when usda or someone is coming to watch other wise you will package mole scraped food. Pick up food off floor to send out. Hormel is one of the nastyest foods ive ever seen made
good,good job. if new you will most likely get forced to work 15 hour days or nights and forced in on weekends. other then that good pay and ok benefits. profit sharing after a year
good,Hormel Foods is a overall good company to work for but all employees are not treated equally. At times you have to work in a hostile environment. It can be hard to work with some of you coworkers there because they like to keep up a lot of mess and spread rumors. I've learned to just go to work and get the job done. Don't try to go there to make friends and socialize. Management stick together so make sure you be on top of anything that you have an issue with. The hardest part of the job is the work environment at times.
good,"Make sure you get the right department for you... Not all departments are created or treated equal. Management in some departments listen and value what their followers are telling them, in other departments no so much. As a supervisor, that could be frustrating. "
good,"If you are young with a degree, you get promoted whether you perform or not. If you're not young with a degree, you get ignored and you just fill a space. In the Fall/Winter, they work you to death. They couldn't care less about the Holidays and family time. If you're a floor person, you can forget about the Holidays. If you're higher up, you get it all. "
good,The company had their own way of doing things.   It is best to start right out of college.   Previous experience is tough to bring in.
good,"A food plant that make chili, beef stew, dumplings, and bacon.  The culture is a good mixture.  Food and People Safety is the key thing in the plant.  Nothing is really hard and is too learn."
good,For me this job was a great way to get work experience at a large company. It gave me an excellent foundation of skills that I have used throughout my career path.
good,Machine operator for molding pork belly's to be ready for slicing operation of bacon. Working as a team makes the workplace more enjoyable and gives for a productive day.
good,"I must say the best thing about my time at hormel/cytosport were the people."
good,"Decent place to work, could use production employee improvement such as care. Otherwise plenty of oppurtunity to move."
good,"Overall Hormel is a good employer.  The culture is challenging for outsiders and it usually takes an extended period of time for people to feel they belong.  Once you are considered an insider, there is job security but until then there is suspicion.  A key skill for survival is a willingness not challenge the status quo.  Conformity and risk aversion are valued traits."
good,Fast paced with inexperienced management which made it stressful. Mandatory overtime. Majority of laborers didn't speak English. Expectations unfair. Attitude of upper management unfair. Time off for family emergency very strict.
good,"Todo bien.. se trabaja en equipo.."
good,"There is a lot to learn here if your going into the maintenance field. Good place to put educational skills to the test. The people for the most part are friendly, sometimes it takes them a bit to adjust to new people."
good,"Working in a cold freezer most of the day was hard, working fast pace made time go by faster, management was great and helped me whenever I had questions"
good,well you v\come in and find out what meat we runnin today go dig it our a sub zero freezer wait for everyone to get to the line to begin a days work then which usually starts late i dont \mind staying late but not when its because people are late commuinicating the days agenda and themn you satrt the process
good,"Being an electrician I enjoyed troubleshooting.  Running large scale projects, I enjoyed.  There was usually some modifications that had to be done, in order to install new things."
good,"being that they run production for the most part 24 hours a day, 6 days a week, there is plenty of opportunity to get many hours but at the same time it makes it difficult to get time off. they also move the supervisors around so much that you are almost always training your supervisor in and it makes it difficult to address issues."
good,hormel is a very face peace place to work.  its very hard work but i enjoy it .  there is alot nice people to work with .  there is alot of room for advancement
good,"Hard to say, I only worked here a short period of time due to the fact that I was living in Orangevale CA.  The time I was there was great, enjoyed the training."
good,I have enjoyed working and helping people understand the policies of the Human Resource Department. At times it was tough and challenging position due to the fact that I had to make decision that I personally won't approve.
good,"Very long hours, also you will work a lot of 6-7 days a week. They do pay out a bonus based on performance, which you will be able to follow. Upper management will provide opportunities for learning and areas of coaching to make you better."
good,"Hormel Foods is a good place to work. They provide benefits and a competitive wage. That being said, they are a fortune 500 company and it is all about the money coming in. People, for some reason, are not as valuable as they should be, to the corporate managers."
good,The people are the most enjoyable part of the job. Great culture and great atmosphere. There are a lot of new lines coming into this plant with a lot of opportunity with long hours.
good,Typical day; getting set up for product to be run.Running packaging machinery.Working hand in hand with other employees to get product out in a timely and efficient manor. Working in a set detail to management requirements.Hardest part of the day was delays from machine brake downs causing loss in productivity.Best part of the day was seeing the work accomplished.
good,"My typical day at work would be to support plant managers with overall efficiency information and reports, through data entry of daily worksheets, total daily production hours, downtime and any discrepancies experienced during production that may affect productivity.  I increased my computer skills with excel formulas, graphs, reports and spreadsheets; Furthermore, obtained new experiences while having to filling in for various departments during employee’s absentees.  I also accomplished excellent management skills through administrating, organizing, and prioritizing workflow to meet deadlines. Our office staff worked as a team and maintained a great working relationship. During slow season, but I normally assisted in various departments as needed to remain occupied.The most enjoyable part of this job was to expand my knowledge through various challenging work responsibilities."
good,"A typical day requires me to manage my current process, as well as employees. I must coordinate and update the daily/weekly schedule. It is my duty to order all supplies required to support my daily/weekly schedule. I try to create this schedule in the most efficient way as possible. Through out the day I maintain productivity and yields. As problems a rise in the process, I come up with solutions to address these issues. I provide adequate support to my 2nd shift counterpart so the department is as optimal as possible in all facets. Ultimately, I am responsible for maintaining a positive P&L in the department."
good,I like it the hours are long. The pay us good in just looking for something a little more with not as many days. Right now I work about 7 days a week. It gets tiring
good,"some departments are more fast paced than others. you make friends and can make the work day fun. "
good,"Good place to work if u don’t have family "
good,"You learn a lot on the job. There is minimal training. You're basically on your own to figure everything out. The support system could be better. You get paid a lot for your job. There was a lot of opportunity for advancement, until the buy-out."
good,"Hormel Foods was a good company, to work for. It's just where I worked, we worked too much in the pre-cook department, We only would get Sunday off. Then go back for another six straight days. When I first started out we would work twenty straight days, or thirteen straight days. The money was good. But,I also have to have a life.."
good,"The company will take care of you by paying you well, allowing relocation if jobs exist, ability to explore other opportunities within the company.  However, poor work life balance."
good,If you love to live at work and only want to be home long enough to sleep and eat breakfast. This is the place for you. I have been here under a year and have had a 6th of the days off I would have had at my former employer. Only slightly exaggerated.
good,Very hostile environment with some employees and upper management.
good,"The Justin's office offers a lot of amenities and philanthropic support for the natural/organic community. "
good,"They pay very good, alot of benefits, including health, vacations and 40k. Its packing company so is very fast paced, and compitive, and pure hard work."
good,"I would rather not go into detail about working with  this company in my review.  Hormel in its whole is a great company, but change happens."
good,Worked 60+ hours a week and was starting to get burnt out. It was  a good experience overall and you will learn a ton. Management does care about your career and advancement and is helpful about getting you to where you want to be.
good,"pay is good that is all, hot in the summer and the management wasn't all that great,full time though and if you don't mind physical labor then this one is for you"
good,pay was good. management not good.management lie on employees to cover their buts. sleeping with every employee that let them
good,"PRO: Difficulty of the job and the opportunity to advance and make a good living (compensation and benefits). "
good,"Accounting is still struggling to move away from the old school ways of Hormel in the sense that work/life balance and work flexibility is still a struggle. "
good,"Do your job, show up for work."
good,"A lot of repetitive, and often heavy, lifting. Almost no downtime. Supervisors are competent, but rely to much on what the computer shows them. More personal interaction and knowledge would help the work environment."
good,"Worked in mid-level management; production supervisors are overly hesitant to trust anything that non-production staff say. Frequently had to communicate what should have been directly to supervisors instead to personal manager or plant manager in order to necessitate change. "
good,A place to work if you don't mind getting dirty which they provide uniforms for all their employees that way your street clothes stay clean which is good hours were decent unless something broke down which it happens. Overall decent place
good,"Night Canning Production Supervisor:	"
good,"Always productive"
good,"This company has great benefits for it's employees. While there are high expectations for work performance, one feels accomplished at the end of the day for all the hard work he/she put in."
good,"Typical Day-Fire Drills , last minute requests "
good,"Was a good place to work pay wise, but was expected to work 12hour shifts if other shifts called in and didn't have any back up to cover for people who called in. My department wasn't that great at letting me know if we were going to have to pick up Saturday work."
good,ill come into work and just get started. Coworkers were nice always helpful when i needed help. Good management they cared about their workers. Overall a good place to work.
good,"It was a good place to work at, long hours good pay, all the jobs in the factory are pretty easy to understand and operator. Management could of been better"
good,Working in production is not my ideal spot but it had helped me gain the management experience I needed after college. Most of the people are nice and the employees are wonderful but quality management and work life balance is seriously lacking.
good,Great company with a lot of opportunities for career growth.  Many training opportunities within your career field.  Great family benefits.  Teamwork rules
good,"I had a lot of problems with them due to medical reasons, so I may not have a lot of confidence in this company as of right now. I could not recommend this company to anyone because of my situation."
good,"PRO: Paid really well which keeps most people there. Can earn a lot of PTO working extra weekends. "
good,"If you're looking for excellent benefits and compensation packages and have no family, this company is the place for you. "
good,Fast Pace days most coworkers are team players mangement can sometimes put more on u than u can bare but over all its a good company
good,"Very repetition, not much change in a packing house. Very early start 430am. Has a slow season and a busy season wish it was more even. They bring in alot of young supervision with not alot of experience in this line of work, not a positive thought for employees that have been there for awhile to have someone that doesnt know what there doing telling you how to do your job. Time management would be the most difficult, getting your jobs done in a timely manor, theres always something breaking or we dont have all the stuff to get the job done. I like the pay just wish there was more of it, benefits are good and for the most part they treat you good there. I need more money for my family and am willing to work more hours to do so."
good,keep the production lines running
good,"Hormel was a great place to work. Come to work, be on time, do your best. "
good,"Intense, faced paced environment in the food industry.  Working in the Engineering or R&D divisions requires a thorough knowledge of food science, food processing, and food production equipment."
good,"Great place to work, but a very unknown career path regardless of success levels.  Lots of opportunity and diversity, strong leadership, diversified so positioned for success in volatile markets."
good,i enjoyed working for JEnni'O foods which was taken over by Hormel foods.it was good pay and benifits. hormel built a new plant in merose minnesota. good company
good,Good start for new graduates to get experience.  Good people to work with if you are used to that type of culture but if not it will be a hard adjustment.
good,"Solid Fortune 500 company well managed at the top level. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of ""old school"" middle management people who make life difficult for those around them. New supervisors coming in have been a positive change in most cases. I cannot speak for all of Hormel; only one small business unit."
good,Love the money only too many hours they make you work.  Supervisor don't know how to work equipment but expect you to know how to run it and you usually teach them
good,Was nice place to work and provide for your family. The benefits are great  and the overtime pay is great. If you don’t mind putting in the hours and the work is not to hard
good,"Great company, good job security . Needs to improve work/life balance. Pretty busy with long hours in the fall. but overall not a bad company to work for so I would recommend to others."
good,"You do a lot of fast paced work, but you earned what you should for all the effort. Management could use a some work though. you were always called in on your days off to be a general worker for a different shift even if you are a job owner."
good,"Long working hours doesn't help work-life balance, but management is compensated very well for this. Everyone is very hard working can be very competitive."
good,"Too many chiefs and not enough Indians, everyone also has a better way to do things."
good,"The typical work day can be very stressful and challenging.   I have learned how to solve numerous problems on a daily basis.  The management is solid, but will only advance the people that they like, not the ones that do the best job.   The workplace culture is pretty good overall, but people that put in long hours regardless of how hard they work are highly thought of.   The hardest part of the job is working with a maintenance workforce and managers that do not want  to keep the equipment running all of the time.  The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships."
good,fast paced working environment with good benefits. long work weeks almost always working 6 if not 7 days a week up to 10 hour days. paid vacation and holidays
good,"Outstanding company with a change in leadership that brings with it a cultural shift.  A historically conservative company with a lack of diversity, the corporation is attempting to alter the composition of its workforce overnight, setting diversity goals at all levels of the company and increasingly hiring from the outside rather than following its traditional promote-from-within culture."
good,The overall experience I have had a Hormel Foods is good. People care about you. It feels like family.
good,I would recommend this company to everyone. They have a great compensation package.
good,"busy,  be prepared to work 7 days a week.    been doing it for almost a decade of 7 days with very few days off.   Great group of people that are employed  there."
good,"I enjoyed working there for the experience and knowledge i gained for the machinery in the plant.  There was however, some toxic people there, you'll find people like that anywhere you go."
good,"High expectations of salaried employees, but fair compensation and benefits package.  Each day at a manufacturing plant has new challenges and opportunities for growth."
good,I enjoyed working for Hormel they had decent pay and the hours weren't too long but I did want to work days and that dindnt seem to be a possibility.  They did have good benefits though.
good,"No thing more to say. Working with Hormale  company  is excellent. "
good,Osceola foods is not  a bad place to work. In my experience it wasn't the greatest place to work. Working as a service driver I felt we were not paid enough for all the things that we had to do.
good,"Hormel foods is a nice company to work for, I would most definitely referral my friends and family to Hormel foods for a career opportunity. I have grown so much working for this company."
good,"On night shift, you day starts with you meeting with your day counterpart to get information on how the plant is running. You then talk with anyone you need to to get more information."
good,It's ok just don't get hurt the medical department doesn't do their job like they're supposed to.  The work itself isn't to bad tho just a little crazy sometimes.
good,"Working at Hormel was great, great benefits, paid vacation and good culture of the company. The only lacking part, there was no job advancement and also I was moving to another state, so I was not able to continue working there."
good,"Hormel Foods is a very interesting place to work, you learn about different foods and why the quality of there band is best. Hormel has taught me a lot about working safely, and giving our customers the best quality food."
good,"Hormel is a good company to work for.  They have always treated me well, but is not for everybody.  It is hard work with high expectations."
good,"Amazing benefits and competitive wages."
good,"Had a good sence of belong safty was always number #1 "
good,Nice people to work with but management can be a bit rough depending on location
good,"Overall great company very stable, very good training program, and great people to work with."
good,"early morning prepare for production to start, troubleshoot equipment, locate parts and make repaires in a timely manner as possible. when everything is running, look for ways to improve plant equipment or systems. Improve on plant preventive maintenance procedures. Management is supportive and hardworking."
good,"I like working here, however you have to be careful of which departments you select. It can be a grind with little help in some, but others you have a full team ready to play the full game with you."
good,"The work life balance with the four on four off on dayshift is a good balance. The four on four off schedule on night shift is a difficult transition to make, if you change your schedule to meet Family obligations."
good,"A typical would be me coming in and get all my cleaning supplies ready. I would then clean my assigned machines and start cleaning them very precisely. I would make sure my machine is cleaned so there wouldn’t be any contamination. I use a lot of chemicals for cleaning. Before our shift is over , a QC comes in and inspect. The people were great and the management was great too. We never slowed down but kept working at a constant pace. Nothing was really hard about work .Just train hard and train right"
good,"Loading or unloading trucks... receiving and puting away product."
good,A great place to work.  Leadership challenges you to improve every single day.  Work/life balance can get out of balance.  Great people and atmosphere.
good,"Typical day a Hormel starts with preparing the department for production.  Accounting for all the resources, equipment, and personnel.  Next is to ensure all appropriate paperwork is available. One of the biggest challenges is keeping the production line running.  Maintenance issues seem to be more and more frequent as the equipment depreciates.  The employees seem to be happy for the most part.  The plant is unionized. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to motivate and teach the employees something new and/or improvements to the operation on a weekly, if not daily basis. To survive you have to be proactive and a take charge type individual."
good,I like working here at the Austin plant. I learned a lot of jobs and have decent seniority so I can mostly do as I want. As a general worker my hours are never the same but that's my choice. Some management can be a pain like the ones that come into change the world but most are family orientatied just like us. Wish I made more but who dont.
good,My job here consisted of working on many different production lines in further processing of pork products. It was a fast paced environment  and very challenging at times but the management kept everything very organized.
good,"Hormel is great in every facet. If you are in sales, your biggest enemy is yourself. You have beat yourself year after year to obtain the bonuses, but it is more than attainable. "
good,"Was working too many hours at Hormel. Although they are a fortune 200 company, they had a very hard time keeping technical people. This caused work loads to increase daily."
good,Use as training ground for the career you want. Not specifically Engineering. Horrible locations for minorities and millennials. Company is still working on culture.
good,"Great experience, great benefits. I learned a lot about this great company. They offer great training to further the managers career if you choose, and they hold you accountable."
good,"very fast pace,enjoyed working with all employes and management,enjoyed the work schedule starting early and getting off early.loved having ever other weekend off"
good,"Hormel can help you learn ways to work alone or in groups. In a group each person has a responsibility. Also managers and supervisors are also very helpful there, which makes them easier to talk to."
good,I enjoyed working with my fellow Maintenance Employees.  The department has a wide variety of knowledge and we had a strong working relationship/bond.
good,Fast paced and decent place to work. Supervisors could be better chosen as they let the power go to their head and give strikes to only certain people.
good,"typical day phone communication; working on order pricing, verifying pricing accuracy, managing pricing - contracts. Enjoyable part is making customers happy and satisfying customers regarding any questions that may arise daily and going out of my way to accomplish the positive end result for the operator.  maintaining accuracy with helping out the Regional gals with sysco order pricing and answering all questions that may arise and inferring that if any questions do not hesitate to call me or send me a memo at any time at all for help.  don't find any part of my job hard.  with deadlines, i decide which portion needs to be done 1st, then i continue with the remainder of the work."
good,Hormel is a nice and safe place to work. Hormel is a friendly work place.
good,Fast pace .Good machine operator.Good management.Great compensation.
good,Good stable company with excellent benefits. Maintenance structure at a plant level if hit or miss. The job is a high stress on the go environment. I learned a lot about maintenance and reliability of equipment.
good,"I learned how to communicate with the language barrier of Spanish and English."
good,Typical day working a bacon line assembly package machine with three other people. It were ok. Learn how to get the job done and be safe. Have team work with this fast pace packer.Management good. The hardest part you have to keep up because if you dont the meat will hit the floor.The enjoyable part is I had good team member for team work and we produce 90% dailey.
good,"Great company to work for.  Supervisors are inexperienced on second shift primarily recent college graduates on their first job.  Most experienced and smooth running shift is 1st of course as would be with any company.  Management has the best interest of their employees and the company at heart.  People safety and Food safety are absolute.  Supervisors, Quality control and Camera system enforce this throughout the plant.  Those you complain about the camera system are the ones who have something to hide, not following safe food handling procedures or not willing to work and of course complain about it because they are finally being held accountable most of the employees like it because it provides for fair and consistent treatment. Hormel is a no nonsense company, fail to follow the rules and you no longer work there.  The hardest part of the job is those who don't pull their own weight.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, all are friendly and willing to help you learn.  The culture is definitely structured for success, bottom line again is if you can't follow the rules you won't last long at this plant."
good,The company is a good company to work for. There is lots of different jobs and room to move around and advance. Regardless of what your skills are training is provided!
good,Great way to get management experience in the food industry. A great team who will provide you with the right resources to succeed. The hours are long but worth it in the long run.
good,Great benefits and worklife balance was decent.  Training was an A+ and job security is very high.  Lacks a motivated workforce at times but culture is slowly turning in the right direction.
good,"Hormel is a great place to work if you like stability and predictable work.  Everything is very methodical and your career is pre-determined.  If you're willing to re-locate to various small towns around the Midwest you can advance quickly.  "
good,"I was responsible for the release of a new snack tray in the Kansas City area. I oversaw 31 stores in which I implemented this product as well as sold in new items, regulated inventory, and checked in with grocery managers."
good,productive place to work. i like that they have an in house where you get to bid on jobs before it goes to the public. great workplace culture. they strive on producing safe quality foo
good,"gave me opportunity to learn more about the meat packing. working in quality control was great and being vacation relief, I got the chance to work in different areas covering for other QCs on vacation."
good,great company to work for always advancement opportunities. i worked in a few different departments and was given the proper training to complete my everyday tasks
good,The main part of my day involved walking the floors and exchanging knives with workers and also meat refurbishing. I enjoyed the position I was in.
good,"I am a quality control technician at Hormel Foods, which is a food processing plant. My typical day at work will be to go in several assigned departments and perform quality checks such as weight control, temperature accuracy, label verification, as well as the quality of the finished product. I work along side production supervisors, plant managers, and superintendents. We have an awesome team at Hormel Foods, that strive to produce quality products to our customers by enforcing the importance of safe quality foods."
good,it was an ok place to work it was just really fast pace I would recommend to anyone looking for a good paying fast pace job with lots of long hours its all worth it
good,Fun sales office to work for; very friendly and all worked together quite well.
good,Todo está muy bueno En esta compañía muy bien y tiene muy buen sistema de pago
good,hormel was really my starting point in manufacturing. I started out as a sanitation worker cleaning all production equipment third shift. then about 6 months i had bidded a job and got the 2nd shift cook job. from there i was interested in maintenance so i went to school during the day. Graduated in 2009 then became a mechanic really great pay.
good,it was very exciting place to work. i had to process pork bellies into bacon. i made the hormell chilli. we made salt pork.
good,At Hormel i basically was a sanitation worker i cleaned bathrooms and drove the scrubber to make sure the floors were clean for the workers .
good,learned about food saftey and q a responsibilities and how to properly follow USDA guidlines
good,typical day was exactly the same. Management was strict and had unreasonable expectations for the employees. I learned how to multitask and work in a high stress environment.
good,They are a great job but not good on training to much before you are expected to do things. Great company just not as understanding as i expected while i had pnemonia i was fired for missing 1 day in probation and left for 30 minutes when my kids had 103 temps. I only left to give tjem tylenol and take them to my father while i finished out my day.
good,"Hormel is a company that is focused on keeping its customers and employees happy and safe. The people that work there take pride and ownership of their roles weather it be putting bacon in a box or troubleshooting a complex piece of equipment. If you're looking for a place that promotes equality, diversity, inclusion, safety, and work life balance, this is the place for you."
good,"It's the best pay you can obtain in Austin with or without a college degree and grow within the company.  They have vision, dental, and health insurance in a wide variety of plans you can choose from.  They provide 401k plans and pension as well."
good,Good people and place to learn and advance. Employees are rewarded for good performance and the benefits the company provides are awesome. Sometimes has a large corporate feel that can be intimidating and can hinder communication.
good,I work from Sunday to Thursday .I learned how to clean stuffs on that company.my co workers are good for me we work in group by helping g each other. There is no any hard part for me. The most enjoyable part is the test kitchen.
good,I enjoyed working with the people fairly closely. I only really worked with two or three people every day but to be fair I was only an intern so it might be different for a full time worker. Everyone seemed really friendly and accepting of each other.
good,"It was fun learning the sales approach for Hormel Foods. In this position I assisted the Sales Reps in taking their orders as a result of being on the road, making calls to existing customers to see if they needed to place a food order and the process of rotating the trucks for delivery. The hardest part of this position was that there was a lot of down time. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to many customers from various well known companies and getting to know them on a professional level as well as a semi-personal level."
good,"good 401 k,good surrounding.good to work OT.nice to see people work in and out.You can work flexible  time.nice people,very good company."
good,Great place to be employed. To bad it is closing down on 02/20/2015
good,I was planning to retire from here with a nice retirement package but we lost the Splenda contract and they had to close one of the plants. Unfortunately it was mine. It was a good place to work with good management and a friendly atomoshere.
good,Work was easy if you expected long hours. If you work hard and earn your seniority getting the time off isn't as hard as some make it seem. Being reasonable with request knowing it's a company that has demands gets you further. HR and management are easy to communicate with. Supervisors are only as good as the floor is running. Bad day stressed supervisors.
good,Hormel Foods is an excellent company. I would recommend the company to anyone. The company culture is second to none and everyone treats each other with respect.
good,Great attitude with all personal. They always tried and brought out the best in you. Follow all ssop/gmp lots of safety training witch is good for all employees!! Safety first

good,made sure all maintenance schedules for machines was complete. able to build and make improvements in equipment as soon as routine maintenance was complete. was compensated for performing extra duties. learned a'lot about packaging machines and conveyors excellent managers. and knowledgeable employees. hardest part of the job was swing shift every week 1st 2nd and 3rd shift.the most enjoyable part of the job was working in different departments on different machines
good,I have really enjoyed my time at Hormel.  They take good care of you when it comes to compensation.  The people are easy to get along with and even if you don't have a college degree they give you an avenue to advance into management if you are willing to work for it.
good,I was satisfied with position i held as maintenance mechanic more work than what i needed
good,"My typical day at work: help mechanics set up, check all electrical systems before start up. stand by at start up, and any trouble "
good,"We would check lunch pails and check truck load numbers not to mention we would go on rounds checking the inside and outside of the building, all in all a great job experience."
good,I was employed at Hormel for 14 years. They paid the best and had the best benefits which included profit sharing. I worked there in the 70s and 80s. Hard work but good pay and benefits.
good,I hated my probation time 3 months  because my supervisor was very mean and would give us the worst jobs to see if we quit.  But fortunately  I am not a quitter  I survived it.
good,"very good work envirment ,lots of oppertunity to learn new sapects of  progrmming allen bradley software. Able to update older equipment with minimal supervisor"
good,"get dressed and ready to work, go down stairs meet up with coworkers and wash hands and say hi to everyone and get job assignments and get set up for work and start doing our jobs.."
good,"I move boxes of meat from my co-workers. I do back flushing. I weigh boxes,print labels and put away boxes."
good,"Co.where you have a choice in your future, great pay,meatpacking will always be hard work, co.rich in tradition, just dont smoke on the roof at break!"
good,Great place to work  but  the upper management needs to change from plant manger to personal that’s my opinion . Overall it’s a great place to work and raise a family
good,A topical day at work was most of the time a good day. Good people work there and everyone does their job.Managment was good. Hardest part of the job was working double shifts but that was optional.Most enjoyable part of the job is to go to work and prove who you are and what you can do.
good,"A typical work day for me consisted of getting all paperwork ready for our run, checking everything and making sure it all matched up.  I also had to work with USDA and QA to make sure everything was within perameters."
good,"Great place to work, exceptional benefits package, sales must relocate so that can be tough, but overall everyone was very helpful, supportive, willing to listen, and truly cared."
good,"The front desk requires 110 % effort in making sure that Customers, Clients, and Vendors, are confortable and taken care of."
good,"Typically I would go to the office early in the morning. Usually I was the first one there. I would turn on all the equipment. Check both fax machines for faxes, orders, etc.  If I had any orders I would make sure that they would be the first things I do every morning. The Corporate office is in Austin MN, which is 3 hours ahead of AZ.  Typically fresh pork orders would have to be done asap. There were many times that we would get add on orders after cut off, which is at 9 AM our time.  If that happened we had to get the manager to approve any add on's.  The management was great. My manager was very easy to work for. She was always supportive with anything I brought to her.  The most enjoyable part of the job was putting in orders. I worked with mainframe, which was a new challenge for me. The hardest part of the job was Accounts Receivable.  Sometimes that would get challenging. Many times the Reps were 100's of days behind, and I would have to try to get information from the distributors to make sure we had all the information we needed to get payback. Many times I had to write claim's because of the lateness of payback. My co workers and myself all seemed to get along quite well.  We were more like a family than co workers. This was a temp to hire position. I was told that I would be on boarded by the manager. The main reason I no longer am working there is because of my husband's diagnosis. He was diagnosed with cancer and at the beginning I had to take time off (which I made up for by going in at 5 AM on some mornings) so that I could take him to his chemo treatments. When"
good,"I loved this job, and there is always somehting new to learn in so many departments here. I learned every quality assurance technician job and covered holidays and vacation sof people and I loved each day and moment in this job. I loved woring with the supervisors to figure out a solution to the problem. It was the best job ever, and unfortunately we moved back home to Oklahoma. Here I am hoping to find a similar job that I just love."
good,"Hormel Foods is a fantastic place to work. The sales professionals are given all the tools they need to succeed, have open communication with individuals in the marketing/sales departments to help them achieve their sales goals, and have clear alignment with management. Selling with Hormel means selling the top brand in the industry, with name recognition and partnerships to achieve lift.  Sales Executives are able to set their own schedules, and can work from home if scheduling conflicts demand it. You are treated as high functioning, sales professionals, expected to achieve Results, without any sort of hovering, helicopter-like managers. You are empowered to sell and manage at Hormel Foods, but that comes at a cost as you are generally working longer hours to manage all aspects of the job, especially for a Senior Account Executive."

good,It was a week day job or sometimes one weekend. I learn how to trim a pigs ribs out. Management was fine. Really hot inside the company. The chains were fast and sometimes could cut yourself.
good,Great work environment.  Would absolutely work for this company again provided I didn't have to relocate.  Not only did the company have great health benefits but they matched my 401k.  I also was able to at times get free meat products samples.
good,"While working at Hormel I operated machinery, walkie forklifts as well as sanitation trucks. I also counted  Inventory. I also enjoyed working with all different people of cultures and race.  Of the 38 years I was there my co-workers became family and we enjoyed outside activities."
good,I was a relief supervisor so I was exposed to many different departments and gave 150% to Hormel they are a great company to work for.  I can get along with any ethnic group and Hormel was union and never had a step 3 grievance filed against me.
good,Being in this kind of factories is kinda hard but sometime is fun to work..the reason I said is kinda hard is that a lot of the works are need to be 100% done by the time you w we ere schedule to be done..

good,Hormel Foods is a great place to work.  The corporate culture encourages creative solutions and inclusive teams.  I was given great responsibility on my team and was able to work cross-functionally with other project leaders to create engaging eLearning.  The company is dedicated to Grow Talent and there is plenty of opportunity for advancement.  I recommend.
good,"The job is very stingy but, good money I can’t complain about, it cuz I choose to work there, I have more overtime, sometime working harder, sometime we work 12 hours"
good,"My training has been nothing but a positive experience. Everyone on my team and throughout the company is welcoming and kind. This company challenges me and allows me to experience new things, and is understanding if mistakes are ever made. A perfect environment to learn about sales and grow in your career, and they are very helpful in encouraging upward growth via promoting from within."

good,great benefits and pay increases. great work environment and a great commute if you leave east of atlanta GA Great shift pay and work hours are very competitive
good,I enjoyed the work that I did there. I enjoyed working withe people I worked with. I did not like the work climate that was there. There was a lot of conflict between management and the union.
good,Excellent Minnesota based company. Great pay and benefits with this employer. Gained work experience working for a major corporation. Wonderful company to work.

It's a beautiful building."
good,En lo personal me gustaba mucho el trabajo buen ambiente y te daban descanso cada dos horas.

good,I am a hard working person. I am willing to work by my self or with team members. I respect work ethics.  I am a perfect attendance.
good,"Very solid company to work for. Overall, they are very fair and are willing to set you up for success. Management is very knowledgeable and is willing to help you grow with the company."
good,Starting up my machines. Getting the product to come out looking perfect. Making sure the hopper is full at all times. The weight had to be dead on. At the end of the shift we had to tear down and wash some of the equipment. I learned that without proper tools people could get seriously hurt. Management would do anything they could to help/work out any problems I had. As long as I kept them informed. Everybody did their job and would still help out in the other sections when time permitted. The hardest part was trying to figure out all the different variables to make everything work out! Wether or not if we put out more product than 1st shift did not matter to me. It was when we met our quota and teared everything down within our time limit! That was what made my day!
good,"Stockton plant management was good, but the main personnel in Minnesota decided to shut down in Stockton plant. I learned to work safely and they trained me how to do a high quality of work. Also, my co-workers were good and helpful and so was our supervisor. He was good at giving instructions to the workers."
good,"I worked for Hormel from 1996 to 2002. I was a union worker from 1996 to 1999. It is where I was given my 1st opportunity in a management role. I worked 1st shift for about 2 years of my  time, and the rest was on 2nd shift. Great leadership, I enjoyed the people I worked with. A typical day was from 1 or 2 p.m. to around 12 a.m. My co- workers were outstanding and we had good synergy and respect for one another. The most enjoyable part for me was the confidence that I had in my job based on the fact that I knew the system very well, and I understood how the company functioned. It really helped me excel in my new role. One of the struggles, were filling orders in the Ham packaging areas. It felt at times we had many equipment breakdowns making it difficult to hit production requirements from time to time."
good,"great co workers and boss"
good,"On a typical day, we come in and do our job without worrying about who is going to do what, when and where. This place is very organized and well put out. Everyone is cooperative and friendly. Each day a schedule is made and all you do is come in and check in and you already know where you are going and your responsibilities for the rest of the day. I love working at this place. Everyone is like family to me and I love coming to work because I feel safe and secure with them. I think the hardest part of the job is the malfunctions of our machinery. A day could be very slow and long if our machines don't work right but other than that, I never had a hard day at this job. I love this job and I would recommend anyone of my friends and family to come work for Hormel Corp. If they there is a branch of Hormel Corp where I moved I would most definitely be working there as well. I enjoyed every bit of the days I work for Osceola Foods LLC, a part of Hormel Corporations. So if anyone is interest in moving to Iowa, I do recommend to consider Hormel. Thank you."
good,"Typical day as a merchandiser is never typical !  There are all kinds of problems that can occur, from products not arriving on time,"

good,"Excellent company to work with and for, leadership was excellent."
good,A typical work shift at Hormel Food was strictly business. I learned business is business. Management could use improvement. My former co workers had various issues that's just life in general. The hardest part about the job was communication. The most enjoyable part was the benifits.
good,Very hard work and long hours but its interesting to clean and sanitize huge food processing machines. Loved operating the sissor lift and they also certify you on the fork lift and cherry picker
