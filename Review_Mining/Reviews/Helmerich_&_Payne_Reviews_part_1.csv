bad,Good job good people good environment good career path for beginners in oil field good people that are willing to teach and help with transition ing to job
bad,Work for them for 10 months. They hire non stop when work is slow. The work is extremely up and down due to management. Management does not care because of the fact they get their guaranteed money along with their outrageous bonuses! It’s sad because the guys they have there busy their tails for them. With better management the trucking division would be top if the line. But until then it’s garbage. Do not work for them!
bad,"I would not recommend any of my friends or family to work for this company. However, the money was nice."
bad,"They say they care about you and your family. Their pay stays below average for the industry, bonuses are laughable. If you are worthless and lazy, this should be a good place for you. If you are hard-working, they will run you into the ground and reward you with nothing. You will remain in your position while others around you are promoted. They promote lazy non-productive workers simply to get rid of them. Then they replace the lazy worker with another lazy worker from another rig because his manager wanted to get rid of him so he was promoted."
bad,Avoid at all cost. Your health is so much more important. Management is horrible and HR doesn’t look into complaints. Everything is a priority. And I mean EVERYTHING. Software is not tested before rolling out and something is always broken... daily.
bad,"Ethical problems are taking over.The company as a whole, is fine. My division at the FMC has taken a drastic change. I don't think management is heading in the right direction."
bad,"good job for a young single man, that enjoys no rest for two weeks straight, and working with others that are on edge, also a lot of stairs and  high noise levels,"
bad,U don't get no hours .thay have favoritism.the bosses never return your calls. Poor management. the supervisors talk behind your back. And the boss is just don't care.
bad,Not  competitive  Pay compared to average   Get raises to district yet cut money from the safety aspect of the company. Was a great company but has gone done hill over the last few years.
bad,"The corporate culture was already clannish and elitist, but when they went public, the humanity of their employees ended completely.  Pursuit of nothing but another percentage point for the shareholders is the way of things now.  The pay and benefits are great, but if you go to work here, just know that you are nobody.  Enjoy the pay and be ready to move on when they are done with you."
bad,"The pay was great, other than that I have nothing good to say about it."
bad,"Learned something new every day, management was exceptional, co-workers were good to work with, being away from family was the hardest part,"
bad,If you are of African American heritage this is definitely not the place you want too work. The racial discrimination on the rig sites and stack yards were very out in the open and rampant and HR could care less
bad,"H n p was an ok company. They would lay people off during a oil boom and I don’t agree with that, I worked on some nice iron with them and they probably have the best iron"
bad,"poor rig management, unsafe work environment. companies policies and procedures are not enforced at the job site. they claim to be a very safe working company and their number one goal is safety, which it is not."
bad,have to work hard and money is great but you have to really hope they arent trying to lay you off. was there for 4 months and got let go so they could replace me with someone who had seniority over me
bad,"H&P was a great place to work when I was hired.  Over the last 4 years, the employees have just become numbers.  Way too many middle managers and meetings."
bad,They don't have any idea how to manage. They don't take any blame for managing failure. Any failure is blamed on production. Welders. And crew. They do really good training. SAFETY is terrific.
bad,"This is not the old H&P. It is a stock market driven company now and unless you work in the corporate office you mean very little.If you do have to work overtime they will make you go home early each day until they get their money back. I have worked a couple 24 hour days in a single week but didnt make any more money than a slow week. Its become so micromanaged its a joke and the turnover rate is climbing every month. Its just another oilfield company now, nothing special."
bad,Come in and leave. No personal interactions. Not very helpful management. Constantly having to take surveys about the company. No chance for advancement.
bad,"This is a tough gig, especially if you are a woman. This is a male dominated industry that requires you to work with many blue collar male workers with limited education and archaic ideas about the role women play in the work place. That being said, if you are a thick skinned woman and know your job, there is a chance to make it here. Once in, it is pretty reliable."
bad,"Typical workday 0700 - 1700, we would have our safety meeting, then inspect forklifts awhile supervisors would smoke outside on the dock and chit chat about what happened during the weekend for 30 plus minutes while workers are working and at times needing help but the act as they are invisiable. The buddy system is in full affect and if your not in the buddy system your are not getting out of the spot they hired you for."
bad,"They offers you 50 hours and 4 month by year you have only 40 hours. The payment is low compared with other companies at same area. There a lot of Lazy people going  to restroom 3 hours a day. "
bad,"Loved the work and the experience was great until the end. "
bad,I really liked that I have benefits and 401 I just hate the fact that there more worried about going in the hole than stopping the job to fix what needs fixing. I learned a lot in a year and am ready to move on to a more safe enviorment
bad,"Benefits are not cheap, my crew recieves 1 week off and two weeks on. Safety first motto, until management decides that the job is more important than the health of associates."
good,"They hire their friends and family first  , they dont.care about their employees and they dont not abide by there own rules unless it benefits them financially"
good,"Good place if your looking to work plenty of overtime. you will get plenty of on the job experience people very helpful and willing to teach you if your willing to learn, a lot of late nights of working and being in inclement weather not for faint of heart by no means. not for you if you like being home every night"
good,The micro management with the driller and tool pusher was outrageous they didn’t leave me any choices but to leave as I was denied multiple times a transfer to a different location and rig
good,Need better living quarters  overall the job is not to bad I love the crew I work for the management is decent I guess you could say but overall not a bad experience
good,"co-workers/crew is very racist, a typical day is long, I'm too far from home, I have to drive 17 hours."
good,I would check all my daily's everything that I had to check in the first thing of the day get with the driller or rig manager on any other activity's to do for the day
good,"Not a bad place to work for. I liked it for the time being, would go back if had the opportunity. The company had a lot of good things about it. The pay was pretty good as well. Learned a lot working on the drilling rigs"
good,Flexible work schedule for any college students or as a second job. It could even be someone's primary job and still have the flexibility to work another job if needed.
good,I started to gain experience in the oil and gas industry but the schedule and culture is just not my preference
good,It’s not a bad job to get into. The time off is great. And the work isn’t that bad. Be prepared to work 12 hours a day. And be on you feet for 12 hours.
good,"Overall H&P is a good company.  Tries to do the right thing - great integrity.  In some departments, mgmt. allows underperformers to continue to underperform.  If you are a good worker, they will take all they can get -- some are rewarded accordingly and others not.  That's just life.  Some areas really care about work/life balance but it is only lip service in other areas. It all depends on who you work for.  The current CEO is a good, honest person who is working diligently to constantly improve the company."
good,"This Training effort was shut down after only 8 months due to the December 2015 oil price collapse. "
good,"It is a pretty god place to work when the oil field is going good.  When is bad though, expect to get send home and look for another job.  You will be cut without warning!"
good,Not for everyone 2weeks on 2 off. Management is shotty. Pay isn’t the best. Dirty unhealthy work environment. Housing living conditions bad 6 people to a skid mounted single wide trailer
good,The equipment was great to work with.  They are at the top of the game when it comes drilling rigs.  Im sure the company is great.  My experience was because of a personal issue with the rig manager.  And that left a bad impression.
good,"Good job when oil price is high. Hard work, long hours, but worth it. 14-14 work schedule, on call 24/7. "
good,Good company to invest in. The technology is great. It is one of the largest drilling companies in the world. lots of opportunities.
good,Met with the team daily just to get a glimpse fo needs. Verified all operations were up and running for Critical apps on Rigs and outlying offices. developed new and enhanced existing processes and procedures for doing work based on the needs of the business. We traveled from national and international sites to train and implement new applications and programs. Worked with Vendors to implement new products or upgrades to existing.
good,"It all depends on hat part of the company you work for. In the Tulsa headquarters, it even depends on who your manager is, as to how much micro-managing is done. It can be wonderful, and it can be a nightmare. Ultimately the inconsistency made it a poor job fit for me."
good,"There was way too much politics.  They got rid of our IT director.  When they implemented Oracle EBS, people's attitudes changed along with their email signatures.  All of a sudden an AP Clerk was an Oracle AP Clerk, etc.  It was ridiculous to say the least."
good,I love my job however due to me being a single parent I can not work weekends and has forced me to look for employment else where as well as the wages are not enough as I just added another little girl to my family. My co-workers are awesome and I really love my boss. With this job as well as every other job in my opinion customer service is the key and number one factor to every door.
good,"Great place to find employment, my travel to and from work is paid for by the company"
good,"The benefits and pay was exceptional. The work manageable, but the co-workers and general culture was poor."
good,I wouldnt work for them again but it was a good company to work for and they take care of their employees. They are very safety oriented and work for some of the best contractors.
good,Spent almost 15 years at Helmerich and Payne where I learn a great deal and met a lot of good people. I started at the bottom and work my way to driller. My rig stacked in the Gulf of Mexico and I was transferred to west Texas. Where I finished my career with Helmerich and Payne. Personnel reason I decided to leave and pursue and career closer to home.
good,It's a okay company just had a lot of up and down problem with the driller. The driller showed lot of favorite but other than that it was a cool  company that payed good.
good,"They were very sneaky and dirty with how they handled the closing of our facility.  They new it needed to close, but they did not want to pay all of us longtime employees a severance package, so they sold to another company that then spent the next two months laying everyone off little by little.  Since we technically only worked for the new company for a couple of months, we weren't owed a severance package."
good,Everything depends on which rig you are placed on. Some have good people with good pushers and some don't. Depending on the rig life can be good or not good.
good,loved working at h and p. 7 great years but soon topped out. lots of great people working for h and p. they are a great company to work for. I would recommend this job to anyone that's ready to work.
good,If you want a challenging atmosphere in the oil and gas industry then get on one of these drilling rigs.  They are diverse and you willlnever have time to get bored as long as you are on well drilling for a contract
good,Opportunities working offshore and on land.  Good place to start an oilfield career and learn a lot.  Very hard work and long hours especially during a rig move.
good,I worked here for over three years and they released me after 3 years.  I would have stayed had I been given the option.  It was a good place to work with good benefits.
good,When i first hired on it was a grest company to work for. They got to big to fast. You became a number instead of a name. Great iron to work on. Pay coukd be better.
good,"You will work at least 12 hours a day, not counting a safety meeting. You work on modern equipment, that is well maintained for the most part. You work on a 14/14 rotational basis."
good,Long days and hours that were very stressful majority of time. Highly wouldn't recommend anyone despite the very well pay. Will not want my future kids in the oilfield.
good,Management does not know what they are doing. Management still has small business mindset and they promote people who have been there a long time even though they do not have any enterprise level experience or the education to be in leadership roles.
good,"Good company with great benefits, good balance with time off and good 401k, I never had an issue with requesting time off management eas very understanding and also gave you the opportunity to make up time"
good,"A typical day was 12 hours, sometime 16"
good,"A typical day at work started at 5:30 am with a morning briefing on the previous shifts unfinished projects and where we are at in the drilling process.  After the morning briefing the rounds are made of the drilling from the ground to the crown to make sure the rig is operational and all functions are up and running smoothly and efficiently. There is always plenty to do so boredom was never a thought, after the first connection of the day we would usually start with resupply of materials and fix any equipment that maybe down.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being outdoors and one with the environment the views and seeing herds of deer and elk and other wildlife in their natural environment"
good,liked the safety importance- enjoyed working with the latest tecknoliogy
good,Its a warehouse job! It good pay long hours but it teaches you how to use tools and be safe in a hazardous work environment
good,I honestly feel that h and p is a good company but I don’t see any advancement and being a machine operator should pay more but they do give out raises and Christmas bonuses
good,"H&P has a great company culture and the compensation is in line with the industry standards. I thought that it would be a perfect fit for me, but management over tasked me, and trained me in areas that were not related to the responsibilities that I was given. Ultimately it was a very frustrating experience."
good,Have a great boss. Does everything he can for his people. His hands are tied by a policy above his level that demonstrates that the company does not value maintenance.
good,"Overall, working there was not terrible. But once you start to try and get promotions, you need to be good friends with management. Work didn't matter."
good,"worked for the company for 10+ years, wouldn't pay me back on food and airline tickets, stopped taking up for hands and started kissing company men's butts instead."
good,"Great experience to start with a drilling company. Great company to work, great company to get your foot in the door.  They help you learn and succeed"
good,A typical day at work involves pulling slips and building pipe. The hardest part of the job is the difficult tasks that consist. The locations are far from home.
good,"A lot of knowledgeable people that are geared for the right reason. Awesome safety program just needs to be followed. They have easy to learn equipment on all of the rigs.. Tools is a hard thing to find on all of rigs and even harder to get ordered. No 2 rigs are run the same it is a different culture on each rig. I found that mine was one of the top rigs as far as safety,efficiency and knowledge.  But every where you go everyone is very helpful. The safety culture that they are trying to achieve will be a great thing once everyone gets it."
good,"I spent one summer as an engineering intern for Helmerich and Payne. If you do not like working outside or getting dirty, this job is not for you. It made me tougher, I made a lot of money, and I learned much about horizontal drilling operations in the permian."
good,"H&P has very competitive pay, almost unbeatable, but the lack of actual management at the company drove me away. Promoting employees based upon how much they are liked by management, and not on their work ethic also pushed me out of the company. Promoting employees to be in charge of the warehouse, that the men in the warehouse had to train to do the job. If you can handle constantly being second best to people that do less work than you, but have a better relationship with your managers then this is the place for you."
good,You work 12.5 hr days min. of hard work in all weather (14 days on 14days off) and well compensated for your time.  You work on a 5 to 6 man crew so the better the guys you are with the better your 14 day hitch.  You live on site with your crew so you will spend as much time with them if not more than you do with your family!!!  You work hard and treat people right then management will treat you well.  The hardest part of the job is being away from family and living on site.
good,The company has wonderful policies in place although they are not always enforced. When it comes to an operator h&p looses its back bone. People aren't taken care of as well as they should. If the company walked the talk they talk it would be awesome. Some rig managers sucked they're way to the position or related to someone.. Promotions are given more on a social status more that qualifications. As far as the job it is great great money for the work.
good,"A normal day was hit the ground running!  You have to be able to multitask, like adding chemical, checking equipment, and chemicals, and building what ever is asked of you."
good,"Very fastpaced "
good,"Work two weeks on/off but the two weeks off is great. The two weeks you work theirs no per diem so the two weeks you are away from home and have to buy your own food ect. with the salary you've earn. So in reality your salary do not add up to what you really think to be away from home,live with 6 people in a small trailer, and plus travel to work unless you live over 500 miles is a problem."
good,Company is ok depends solely on who you know as to your experience within the company. Time and pay are very nice. Working can be quite stressful if you managed to get in on merit. It's a company that values who you know more than what you know.
good,They paid good but you work long hours sometimes with little sleep I would recommend the company to anyone but as far as getting overworked it was a little stressful
good,H&P is a good place to work. Pay is average. Benefits are average. Managers are nice. Lots of exposure to different departments depending on your duties.
good,Learned a lot about the industry and business. Some departments gave advancement based on work ethic which was excellent. Ability to learn new things and assist in other areas.
good,"Take a drug test hair follicle/ urine after interview"
good,"A typical day starts with a morning report, then a 30 minute safety meeting with the crew coming on to work 12 hours.Make sure the well is drill and manage men and money."
good,"Some pushers are easy to work with and some are not, but they are the same everyday so you know what your getting. Truck management feeds off gossip so its real cut throat with co-workers. On the positive side work was steady and they kept up with the equipment."
good,"Not much time off, lots of driving, rigs have very poor time management for maintenance. But overall the company is very good. They are very safety minded."
good,"I loved working for this company. They value safety and using the right tools for the job. "
good,"Management only cared about themselves and looking good. Usually they treat you poorly if you have no prior experience in the field or on a rig. Decent bonuses and pretty good starting pay in my case. Started at 17 an hour. your first year you get longevity pay that starts at .25 cents every three months until your first year mark. I got a raise after working a year and a half of about 1.50$ so I made 19.50 before my 2 years. I received decent bonuses the two years I worked as well. When oil prices are up they have mandatory overtime, at least in the shop I worked in."
good,"I would work for H&P again in the future should the opportunity arise. Great place to work, relaxed environment, unfortunately H&P sold the Tulsa facility and the new company eliminated my position."
good,"Good place to work I learned a lot, and good some great oil fields experience. In my time of working there I made a lot of money and met a lot of people I’d recommend them to anyone."
good,"Enjoyed the work and the people where I was assigned, however no opportunity for advancement forced me to leave. There was a lot of opportunity for overtime, usually all you could handle."
good,"Fast paced, good working environment, work a 14 on 14 off scheduled, not bad if you dont mind being gone half the month all the time. job is physically demanding and long hours"
good,its a 2 week on 2 week off job. the pay is good. i was just tired of being gone 10 to 12 hours away. its is a very fast paced knuckle busting job. its a good work enviroment.
good,"H&P is a great company to begin an oilfield career, or continue a long drawn out career of being gone all the time. For the rig hands it is a lovely 2 on 2 off, but for the CRT/electrician/mechanic hands it is an on call and no ""hitch"" type work. H&P is a great company structurally and the management is a tad above subpar, but that is only due to the few bad apples in the bushel with a lack of experience and no knowledge on how to lead."
good,"good work environment, good rigs. cooperate offices were liars. lots of favoritism for advancement, it's who you know."
good,"good clean work environment, analytical, worked with excel and numbers daily. Spreadsheets and systems software. Accounting, data entry, contracts, billing"
good,"I was a motorman in Odessa, Texas. It had decent pay and benefits. It was 2 weeks on/2 weeks off but after leaving they switched to 1 week."
good,"Wonderful company to work for, with great capabilities. They have the best technology for drilling and are able to keep reinvigorating to complete in the oil and gas market."
good,"Fast pace, productive, and profitable company with the opportunity to travel and meet new people with many different backgrounds. The work is enjoyable and can be very challenging but rewarding to see the outcome on a day to day basis."
good,"12 hour day or night"
good,"Good place to work. They provide decent housing, pay really well and proper training. Safety is #1. Good people to work with also."
good,A workday at the rig is busy from the moment you start until the moment you clock out. I like the way we do Electronic Job Safety Analysis (EJSA) to help aid us into not being complacent and increase the chances of someone getting hurt.
good,"Good work environment, with the ability for great advancement depending on work ethic.  Great work hours, pay and work schedule."
good,"Working away from home was often very difficult, but at the same time it could be very rewarding.  There were many co-workers that I enjoyed working with."
good,Working round a lot of noise and very dangerous equipment you must make sure that you are very aware of your surroundings.
good,"A typical day at work includes assisting the driller with daily drilling operations, transferring fluids, and basic maintenance actions around the rig.  I have learned a lot while working here and have added to my supervisor skills.  The management here is outstanding, all professional, and very knowledgeable.  The hardest part of my job is the basic routine procedures that we all tend to complacent about every know and then.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with."
good,"I spent 3 years with H&P. Worked in the West Texas distarct. Started with them working motors and moved up to derricks right away. Daily tasks were keeping my hands underneth me busy. Showing and teaching them the oil field. Lots of maintaing the mud, lots of working on the pumps and lots of tripping pipe."
good,Connections
good,"The work I Experienced through Helmerich & Payne Inc. was both good and bad. The work requires long strenuous hours of you standing, lifting heavy objects and swinging sledge hammers. all duties are performed in all weather conditions even including extreme weather. You are paid well for your work and my only true complaint was the living quarters that were supplied to the crews. The trailer that the crew were given to stay in were not kept clean and often caused crew members to become sick."
good,I wish my manager had more experience. He does not like confrontation so other employees get away not working up to par. He seems to be intimidated calling someone out.
good,Alot of no good homeboy or friend hook ups and hand outs over hard working people who actually deserve the position and poor character as supervisor or lead
good,hard work great pay long hours drove to work sites and fixed what ever need to be repaired. if there was an electrical wire coming from the equipment I was required to repair it.
good,"Un día típico laboral comienza con el Reporte diario de Operaciones, Recorrido al Taladro, Relación con el Personal, Reuniones de Seguridad, Reuniones de Operaciones."
good,The work wasn't hard I just didn't like being gone from home. It was a very safe company to work for and the management was very good to work for.
good,"Rig inspection and Rig audits"
good,"I pulled back pipe and made connections, scrubbed the rig, maintain the generator. I did lock out tag out."
good,learned more about high tech equipment and management there was very helpful
good,"Enjoyed the experience and knowledge that I received. One of the leaders in the oil and gas industry, a safe and productive environment. It's a very physical job."
good,"we will drill oil wells on a fast and safety paste we will find problems and solve them as quick as possible, we have good employees that are hard working and very motivated people"
good,"You can learn and move up to make more money. There are some good people that works out there. You have to bring your own food, the living quarters is congested."
good,"Good Company with the best benefits I have ever had but the work is intense, fast paced and repetitive. You will spend more time with your crew than you will with your family on a 14 days on and 14 days off schedule."
good,I really enjoyed the culture and the teamwork at H&P.  Just watch out for the cuts when the market goes down.  I was able to travel around the country and to South America.
good,"I just really would like to come home every day.If i lived in texas it would be cool.If they payed for at least part of my travel expenses and or food or perdiem,but they dont."
good,The company has the best equipment. Just that when you are in certain situations you have to do what they want because the want it done. They will not move you up a level even after years of being a that level.
good,"I believe they are still trying to figure out their culture and what they want it to be since the Helmerichs are not in leadership. It's still a great company but it's not like it was. Some may say that's a good thing, to keep from stagnating, but it still hasn't settled into a stable environment that one could identify. Regardless, as long as you can live with not really knowing where you stand, it's a great place to work. You will always have the tools needed to do your job and a fair amount of training if its needed. They are the top in the industry as far as recognition and technology, just a bit ahead of the competition. I think if they stabilize their culture and get back to future focus on Rig technology, they will be hard to beat."
good,H&P is slow paced laid back work environment. The management is responsible and realistic. There are few extra perks and opportunity for advancement is low.
good,Great place to work. Friendly and family environment. Lots of restructuring lately since the downturn of the Oil and Gas Industry. Okay benefits. Vacation package sucks. Takes 5 years to get 3 weeks of vacation.
good,The work environment is ok place. Money is good but it requires a lot of time away form home. Benefits are pretty good as well.
good,"Fun work place,very hard work. It was hard to move up with gas prices low. They recently changed to two weeks on two weeks off instead of one on one off. Great benefits."
good,Exciting workplace with great benefits and an overall good environment.
good,Best company Ive worked for has its bad days though too many worms flooding the oil field.
good,"Before work starts a safety meeting is held and a plan of work duties assigned, based on what is going on. A typical day of just drilling conspires of a good walk around the rig to see what needs done and what is still in good shape. Hardest part of job is really when the rig is tore down and moved, but overall is a safe and easy rig to work on. H&P is a very good company to work for!"
good,"As with any company, there are things that could be improved, but the culture is good. It can take some time to adapt, as not every group in the company is aligned in regards to process, but with that said, there is a push to bring that in."
good,Be ready to work long hours with little  rest. Lots of long drives to the rig and be expected to make repairs as soon as you step on location. The is the most important asset.
good,I liked working for the company a lot. But it seemed like once you was told that you was in line for a promotion you was passed by multiply times and it never happens.   Some of the higher ups tell you one thing and others do something completely different..
good,"Working for H&P was very rewarding, learned a lot from supervisors and co workers. I would be willing to work for the company again if the opportunity was presented"
good,"It is a good place to work, but internal job placement and promotion seems to be very random.  Employees are frequently moved into positions in which they have little or no prior experience and the resulting confusion is often obvious."
good,Working in the oil field is not for the feint of heart. It requires minimum 12 hours a day for fourteen days straight of non-stop work. You will work in every kind of weather event regardless of temperature. You will lift heavy objects consistently throughout each day. The job can be extremely stressful at times due to the work that is being done or just dealing with the time away from family and being 500 plus miles away for long periods of time. It is not a very safe workplace as everything out there can definitely harm/kill you.
good,H&P was quite enjoyable for the small amount of time I was employed there being contracted.  The co-workers were very accepting and courteous and always willing to help me when needed.  I do wish my employment with them lasted longer.
good,A great job. Fun environment when you have a great team around you. They offer great benefits along with a great 401k package. Competitive pay. Great company.
good,"Hardest part of my job with Helmerich and Payne is working with people that have never worked around oil field and the company expects for you to teach them quickly,this company want expectations from new hands that are just starting out in the oil field, for some people it's hard to pick up the style of work that is done out on a rig. I'm just tiered of been away from my family and wat to spend mor time with them"
good,"This is a wonderful company for security and benefits but the last 2 to 3 years that I worked for them it went from very family oriented to the mentality of work first, family second."
good,"I only worked for H@P for a short time, would still be their but with the oil industry in a slump, I was the first to get laid off."
good,Very demanding and a lot of hard work. Its not a job for a normal person. Working long hours and being away from family 2 weeks at a time. You meet alot of people working for this type of company. The hardest part is the physical demand that is required. The most enjoyable part of this job is the bonds you create with fellow employees. There like your second family.
good,their is to much family members from rig manager and down witch cause to much favoritism.
good,"H&P was a great drilling company to work for. The pay and benefits were great. Although it may seem over the top sometimes, safety was a top priority and things were done right. The two weeks on, two weeks off is nice, but can be stressful if you have a family at home. "
good,"I was treated great by shop managers.  They did listen to suggestions.    Need to be more selective when hiring mechanics, a lot of the new hires had never done any type of mechanical work."
good,It's hard work but pays well you are trained to do your job and combine that with many hours of overtime . Weather plays a big part on how your itch will be .
good,"Overall good company to work at. The company is good about allowing the employees to move about to the department of their choice. There can be the fear of getting laid off, due to possible dips in the market, but being informed about the risk before applying is necessary."
good,"I worked for H&P from floors to derricks, loved it. flex 3 and flex 5. got let go early 2016 with the peak of the slowdown. hardest part of the job was maybe the weather in ND during the winter.  not so much from a personal standpoint but keeping lines from freezing and being able to transfer fluids when needed without  any issues. best part was working with good people, pay, work schedule."
good,"I work on different rigs maintain anything electrical. If a rig is down, it;s my responsibility to get it back going.  I change out switches, plugs, lights and cables. I also work on PLC. I work 12 plus hours a day."
good,The job I work at this place can be fast paced at times and sometime it will slow down but really good people and culture. There is always good teamwork involved with eachother.
good,"I've worked here for many years & they've always maintained the safest possible culture, room for advancement & job security.  H&P is a very profitable company that has great business management in place.  As we most in the industry know this can be a volatile market with unstable predictions but H&P has weathered the storm very well."
good,"the company itself is the best out there in my opinion. with that being said it is the oilfield and nobody is really ""safe"" in this industry as far as job stability goes. h&p did me real well and if not for the instability in this industry I would definitely go back to work for this company in a heartbeat. they had the best living quarters that I have ever stayed in. that makes a huge difference on being comfortable being away from home."
good,"Management in the organisation was well versed and efficient towards employees."
good,I enjoyed work for Helmerich and Payne. The work environment was safe. Worked with my hands everyday and had to lift 50+ lbs. everyday and worked alone most of the time.
good,"Operation of the rig’s hoisting equipment and Crew. Supervised the drill crew in making connections running various tools and equipment and Tesco CRT tool necessary to construct the well bore as per drilling programs."
good,Great Company to work for Great pay good co workers 12HR to 16HR days for 14 days on and 14 days Off always something to do always meeting new people
good,H&P was a great company to work for with a wonderful management staff.  It is a very fast paced company with plenty of chances to advance and learn new skills.  Sometimes it is a struggle to keep pace but also the pace made it enjoyable and kept the hours from dragging by.
good,"had real good people to work with, made the best of the times we spent out there 14 days at a time. stay on top of your work and youll never have any problems with anyone out there. great place to see what your made of."
good,"Typical Day at Work "
good,"This was a great career while I had rigs drilling local to my area, but for the past three years I've been living out of a motel for two weeks at a time. If I were single, it wouldn't bother me. Having a small child at home, I feel like I'm missing her grow up."
good,"H&P is a great company to work for. Great benefits, compensation and room for advancement. Hardest part of the job is the physical part especially being out in the sun but also not knowing when the oilfield is gonna go down. Overall I loved my position with the company."
good,ALL was good while I worked for them I continued to learn a lot from the company about the oil field. enjoy my job a lot with them ................................
good,"I worked in IT at company HQ. This is a great company to work for. The culture is amazing. Most people give you a friendly greeting when passing you in the hall. There is an open door policy, so management is happy to hear from you when available."
good,I always felt like my work was appreciated and felt like home we workrd as a team and that made the job go much smoother and easieri think the pay was pretty competive with the other companies as well
good,H&P was a great company to work for and paid very well. The biggest downside was the instability of the industry as a whole. They do their best to keep you informed and stay optimistic but at the end of the day nobody knows what the price of oil is going to do.
good,"I love working for helmerich and Payne, But when work is slow or rigs go down. The pay is good, the work environment is good. The company looks out for you always"
good,"Excellent place to work for. Fair environment, employment depends highly on markets. I worked for very intelligent men and enjoyed what I learned off them during my time with this firm."
good,Working on oil rigs for H&P was great for me. It reminded me of when I was in the military deployed. I was able to go to work focus on the job at hand for 2 weeks and then return home to my family without having to worry about leaving for work for 2 weeks.
good,"I like working for H&P,  but right now oil is down so notes are down. They are a good company to work for. They take care of their employees. Pay is good."
good,"Great place to work, good people, teamwork and a sense of accomplishment after a day's work. Safety is a big factor at H&P everybody looks out for each other's safety."
good,Great place to work i just miss being home with my wife and 3 girls. the pay is great you work 2 on 1 off. 12 hours or more a day. it is a great job if you are okay with leave your family alone for 2 weeks
good,"Helmerich and Payne was good to me for many years, but the work was stressful and dangerous, but they had a very good safety conscious culture in place."
good,If you don’t mind getting covered in drilling mud and pipe dope then you will have no problem working on a rig making hole. Very fast paced and dangerous
good,"Great place to work nd excellent benefits. "
good,I traveled back and forth to Pennyslvania they provided my airfare and place to stay. Was far from home lot of younger crew long days 14 days on 12 hours day but when a crew member was injured slow to respond
good,"At H&P, we understand that technology is merely a tool to put in the hands of the right people. People produce results, and people drive further innovation."
good,"Very Good Environment,,,professional workers, good company to work with , HSE managers are very supportive, and easy to work with, overall team is very good"
good,"loved the field, loved the work, loved the travel and out doors. loved everything about the job days on and days off. well taken care of, and appreciated for going the extra mile."
good,H&P was a great place to work for back then when it was family owned and ever since H&P added investors many unfair change started happening with in the company. It was all about the investors pockets.
good,"This used to be a great drilling company to work for. they cared about employees, not the bottom line. Now it's the other way around, still better than most but not as good as it used to be."
good,Anyone  that has ever worked in the oilfield knows there are no typical days at work. I learned a lot about the new style of rigs that are being produced with all the new technologies. The hardest part of the job was the five and a half hour drive to get there. What I enjoyed most was teaching the young guys that worked for me.
good,es muy bueno porq hay mucha seguridad para con los trabajadores.
good,"worked well with coworkers, whom I became good friends."
good,"Keep up, sink or swim, learn fast are common phrases used in this company. It’s crazy hours and hard work is definitely not for the average Electrician. Would go back."
good,Great company that's very involved in the community. From the exhibits they sponsored at the Tulsa zoo to the work and projects they help with in the surrounding area's
good,"seguridad de los operarios exelente, buen descanso, muchos cursos ,premios, buen salario, dispocision de la empresa al momento de cualquier eventualidad"
good,Had a great crew. We all worked as a team weather it was raining sleeting or snowing we all had a great attitude. The work was hard but we done it 100 %. Worked 12 hours a day. The reason why I left is because the rig stacked
good,Complete the daily to-do list and anything we could find to stay busy. Go on Hazard Hunts to identify and correct potential hazards.
good,"Every day is different.  Individuals will be pushed physically and mentally in extreme weather conditions while enduring long hours.  The management all depends on the worker. If one works hard, management can be pleasant.  If one is lazy, they will be yelled at and possibly fired.  Co-workers become family and you spend more time with them than anyone else.  If the crew is good and gets along, that makes all the difference in the world.  Hardest part of the job is a process where both crews move the rig to a different location in the middle of winter at sub zero temperatures.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when the rig is clean, when drilling is smooth, and when the contractor company buys everyone steaks.  Also, having 14 days off at a time."
good,In my opinion the best drilling contractor out there. Very good equipment and leading edge technology. Knowledgable management and willing to train.
good,"great company to work for plenty of hours, lots of communication. Downside is you never know when you'll be off or whats going on the next day."
good,A lot of heavy lifting and movement during the hottest parts of the day in Midland Texas.
good,"-professional staff"
good,H&P is a great company that has many rigs. Unfortunately I was placed on a rig very unexperienced workers making the operation much more difficult than necessary.
good,"Great work environment"
good,"I learned better communication skills."
good,Good safe enviorment.team culture with room to advance.hours get long sometimes but if you like ot then its a good place. They apreciate their employees.
good,"Excelente empresa, renuncie pues me ofrecieron mejores ingresos y otros beneficios que no tenia.  La administracion de personal tenia muchas fallas pues no habia igualdad en el trato de algunos cargos.  El apoyo de a gerencia muy excelente"
good,"Start off with the morning meeting. Get to work area and talked to relief worker.  Assist driller with operating all equipment and whatever else was needed such as supervising the crew and the jobs needed to be done that day."
good,A typical day at work starts with unloading transfer rollers and organizing the twenty foot I beams and pipes I learned how to use a over-head crane drive a fork-lift and cut metal with a blow torch And the Management was like family they work beside us when we need help and they also teach the basics of working in a welding shop now I'd say the hardest part of the day was grinding all the small and large I beams and stacking all the small I beams on a palate and moving them with a palate jack into the pick up area Finally the most enjoyable part of the job is learning all the new opportunities this job have to offer from moving up in the job to college opportunities threw the job.
good,Helmerich and Payne was a great company to work for. I work for them for 8 years. They have a lot of opportunity for advicement in your career as long as you are willing to learn
good,Great place to work. Family environment. Cool guys that don’t mind showing you how things go. Guys pitch in and help teach and mentor new employees . Great place
good,It is a great job. Loved woring there just want more out of life then they had to give me. You can't get to the front of the pack to lead if yoiu hold yourself back...
good,H&P has been one of my favorite companies to work far. the have awesome benefits and management. Working with this company I learned a lot about drilling rigs that I didn't know.
good,I worked for Helmerich & Payne for 37 years. Advance from field rep to Administrative Manager  overseeing multi billion dollar construction projects in Houston TX
good,Buena compania pagaban buenos bonos pero el pusher francisco cabrera era muy prepotente abusaba de su posicion y maltrataba a la gente eso era lo k hacia el trabajo aun mas pesado de lo k es todo lo demas estaba muy bien
good,It's a very fast work pace environment. I learned how to be safe and to help keep others safe. I learned teamwork is important. I learned that hardworking is also important.
good,Good hard work great people to work with 12 hour shifts 14 on 14 off pay is good for starting these people become your family you look out for each other.
good,"One of the best parts of Helmerich and Payne is the culture the upper management brings to the workplace. The are adamant about worker safety, innovation, and treating one another as family. Some departments carry it out more effectively than others but the environment at the corporate office is one of the best I have ever experienced."
good,Helmerich and Payne Inc. is the premier provider for stat of the art drilling rigs and construction engineering. They are well respected in the industry.
good,Great company lots of growth a lot of opportunities your always in the elements great pay learn a lot about the oil industry  tough work great pay lots of friendly personnel
good,"Heavy lifting, out in the elements. Safety standards always applied in every day task. Live on site job demanding, 12 hour shifts in a 14 day hitch turnaround."
good,"tripped pipe most days, always on your feet. learned how to work on equipment on a drilling rig and what its purposes were. management was great. co workers were nice and very helpful. Hardest part of the job was laying down drill pipe. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting two weeks off after working for 2 weeks straight."
good,good place to work and safety was 100% also great crew members to work with and a lot of heavy equipment and work also cold and hot days
good,while working with H&P we as a team learned how to efficiently drill a very fast well. The equiptment was decent to work with and on. My crew was a blast to work with and could make the longest of days fly by
good,"long days/nights"
good,"I have really enjoyed working for H&P drilling, They have great benefits and really good leadership. If you enjoy being gone from the house this is a great job!"
good,It was not bad stayed busy. I learned how to use ST80 and how to make connections plus how to work the derrick.
good,"worked for H&P for 13 years, the only reason I am looking for other employers is for a better job opportunity"
good,The days are long but the team work is outstanding. Although it is tough there are some enjoyable aspects of it. Very caring upper management and a great team work driven atmosphere.
good,"Great place to work. I have worked for them for 7 yrs and it has been great. Their drilling rigs are top of the line. Nothing can beat a flex rig, it is the best rig ever."
good,It helped pay the Bill's until I could get back to my other job and move on. It was a great experience and I wouldn't change it for the world met alot of great peop
good,long oil field hours but well reimbursed.  Does not matter the weather you will be workining and wearing full pants and long jeans combo to ensure you are always practicing safety procedures.
good,"I recommend this job highly. Great benefits, you get close to your crew and are always busy. You will work long hours, 80+ hours a week, for two weeks. I learned a very wide variety of skills here."
good,"Its a buddy system, if you didnt know someone before going to work on the rig your automaticly the outkast. the money was only thing that kept me going."
good,This was a perfect company for what you would expect roughnecking. Strongly recommend if you can get on with them. I was laid off but I would go back to them
good,"Labor intensive and very fast paced. Nasty work, rough co workers and a harsh safety guide, but all of that is in place so you don't kill yourself. Not for the light heart."
good,"Always fun coming into work every morning. All the employees always in a great mood. One of the most safe, clean, and organized companies to work for."
good,Enjoyed the job enjoyed the people great learning experience.  Was able to take my learning and implementing with little or no supervision
good,"Excellent work environment, state of the art drilling technology, good working relationship with supervisors, The hardest part of the job is keeping and training good hands."
good,"Great place to work. What better place to work than Offshore in Santa Barbara. Very professional supervisors and everyone worked really hard. No complaints, I learned a lot, while at H&P."
good,"Lots of hard work, but there is structure, leadership, cross training, lots of room for advancement & great pay. Learned a lot about team work & working with others to keep everyone safe & healthy."
good,"The feeling of being replaceable at any moment is not the best place for an employee to be, the work is fine i've learned a tremendous amount about myself but i would rather make less money and be home everyday"
good,"Company grew to fast, forgot who got them there! Rig hands built the company. Roughnecks Rule!!! Flex3 best operating rig in the fleet."
good,woked with a great bunch of guys and great management the best job I have ever had. hardest part was being away from family most enjoyable was the guy I worked with
good,"Great company to work for, very safe and great benefits. The job is hard but very well paid. Company strives to be number one, so you work with the best equipment, people, places."
good,Long hours for the days you work but you can't beat 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off. it is like a small vacation every 2 weeks. Good money but the oilfield is up and down.
good,H&P was a great place to work. The work is physically demanding. However rewarding if you can stick with it. Very good teamwork especially if you get a good crew. I would recommend working there to anyone that likes hard work and many learning opportunities.
good,I was recognized and compensated well for my achievements.  The work environment was among the safest I've ever encountered.  The benefits were the best I've ever received.
good,H&P was a great company to work for. There was a lot of good people working there. They work long hours but you have the opportunity to travel and see different places if you can handle being away from your family for too long. They pay really well as well.
good,great leadership on the rig. good adva\ncement. teamwork and learning are discussed with all employees. no questions are unanswered. will work with someone to get close to home.
good,Truly a great company to work for. An industry leader in drilling tech and safety. Upper management is committed to making a safer work environment...
good,I really enjoyed working for H&P. They are very professional and care about the employee. Not to much training but I guess on the job training is the best training you can get.
good,Good company to work for. However once they became public the company became more about the money and not the hands. Great life experience
good,This was a great job with a lot of room to move up. The amount of money you can make out in the oil field is great. It just is not a secure job with the fluctuation of oil prices but when oil prices are strong your life is great.
good,"H&P is a great career job, with lots of opportunities at hand. with some of the greatest technology they have to work with. You are able to learn very effeicent and a safe inviroment."
good,Liked H&Ps schedule. week on week off. New and improved Flex 3 rig package. The equipment was always serviced and maintained well.
good,"1- Good place to work"
good,"While working with this company, I learned a lot about myself and people in general. Having to live with the people that you work with for six months out of the year, you have to learn to work with many different personalities in order to maintain safety that can prevent injuries and death. Also have to work as a team to be productive enough to meet the demands of high expectations of big oil companies that spend over 10k a day to maintain operations. You either preform and meet the demands, or find another job. Working at this pace made things exciting and rewarding for me. After a hard days work, working in sub zero degree weather in winter to 115 degrees in the shade weather in summer, you feel like a man is supposed to feel...accomplished. This job will forever change my life and has taught me that I can and will get the job done, no matter what the situation may be."
good,Great company to work for look forward to working with the company again once oil & gas picks back up. Upper management was also so understanding and cared alot about their employees.
good,"As a field electrician, my job involves traveling to drill rigs throughout my assigned district and performing maintenance or repairs to any electrical equipment on the rig, from PLCs and computers, to 600VAC generators, and everything in between.  I work on call 24/7 for two weeks, then have two weeks off.  I typically work 12 hours per day unless there is an unusual circumstance that requires me to work extra hours.  I do not get called on my days off unless it is to answer a question for a job that I was involved in, or to see if I'd like to work extra days.  Extra work is strictly voluntary, but is available from time to time."
good,This company is a solid company to work for. I love the 2 wweks on and 2 weeks off. I would advise people to apply if the are looking for a 6 mont a year job with guarteed over time
good,A typical  day at work depended on what was going on with the well. We would clean on the rig and perform our daily routine job tasks. I worked on a crew of 6 people not including the supervisors. The job was fun and challenging.
good,"Best company I have worked, management and culture is so amazing. I would not change a thing.  They invest in every employee. It is truly a family.  Love it!"
good,"They are really good to work with and safety is most priority, but some people disagree and don’t want to take into consideration of others point of view and the arguments can get you fired"
good,It was a good place to work. just not to great for a man with a family. You make decent  money but its a lot of hours. The 2 weeks on were always tough but you get 2 weeks off so that helped. and the change of morning an night shifts were hard on a person as well
good,Work culture was not good in South Texas. People were not friendly and just had a bad experience there. The pay was awesome. Would not go back that far from one again for that tho.
good,"Great job for the out doors and rough working person. Some managers a not the greatest, I lucked up and had the absolute best managers I have ever had in a job place. Yes you work out doors in rain and shine 24/7, I enjoy the work. Stress free, high pass, hard work, Drilling for oil and gas. Great work and family life balance. 14 on 14 off. a schedule I absolutely love"
good,"The best overall company I've worked with. From safety to office personnel, they cared about their workers. Management made it a point to visit the rigs an introduced themselves to each hand no matter what position. The managers stood behind policies an procedures as per. company policy."
good,fun environment always meeting new people and learning to not only work but to live with those people.Really good place to show your work ethic
good,"The hardest part of my job is not getting any rest.  I am on the clock for 24 hours a day during a 14 day hitch.  The most enjoyable part of my job is teaching short service employees the right way of performing job duties.  A typical day at work would be depending on what is going on that day.  For example, drilling, running casing, or tripping pipe.  There are also unexpected problems that occur as well."
good,"A typical day working on a oil rig was good and always productive. I learned much about well control and working with pumps most importantly, because if any pump went down that would mean that normal operations would have to stop because there would be no way to keep pumping drilling fluid down hole. the co-workers i worked with were great guys and were all from different parts of the country and working with the co-workers was always interesting because there were different levels of experience. the hardest part of the job was working in all four seasons of the year and most of hardest season to work in was winter because the cold would get down below 60 degrees. the most enjoyable part of the job was at the end of the shift or if during the shift my crew would get to total depth of drilling the hole."
good,"* Manage crew of 20-25 people, while assisting in managing well conditions with drill site manager."
good,"One of the hardest jobs I have ever physically done. I have learned allot of discipline, and work ethics. I have also learned that safety is crucial to a successful operation. When the employees feel that management is supportive and there to answer any questions or deal with any concerns, then the employees will give everything they got. The hardest part of this job is being away from home 14 days at a time. But in contrast to that, it's great to be able to get 14 days off and live very comfortably with a compensation package that is unbeatable."
good,"The culture here is very friendly, and this company strives to promote from within. Support is always offered for any problem that may arise, and the employees from top-level management to drillers are like a family."
good,Good company to work for. Great benefits. 401K. Paid sick time. Up to 6 weeks of paid vacation. Flexible schedule. Paid holidays. Lots of opportunities.
good,Great company to work for. It a very different work culture. Lot of great things to learn from. So you have to be dressed out ready to go to work at 5:30 am. Shift start at six after the safety meeting. Then head to work do what is required for the daily tasks. Make connection or trip pipe in or out of the hole.
good,Really great place to work!! The people and culture are what make it so special. This company values its people and their family life in addition to the work they do.
good,Morning meetings were very informative. Safety was a positive. Company seemed genuinely concerned. Company was laid back. Hardest part of the job were the prints.
good,good pay and amazing benefits. i do not have any complaints at all. i was allowed to get as many hours as i wanted and the pay was good. i just thought it was easy to get stuck in your same position if you get to good at it.
good,"Como Super Intendente un día Típico : Recibir Reporte de los Equipos, Revisar y Difundir; Apoyar las Operaciones."
good,H&P has the best rigs you will ever work on and the most motivated crews that you will ever see because of how H&P treats the employees.
good,"great place to work they teach you everything you need to know. all my co workers were awesome and helped when i needed it. I learned how to rebuild top drives, mud pumps, crowns and blocks, and all B.O.P's. I enjoyed all the guys i worked with. the hardest part of the job was the managers always worried about numbers when we didnt have enough people. the managers were ok they didnt really talk to us or anything they would stand at the end of the building and stare."
good,"I've been worked from Nov 2012 to Feb  2015. My leave schedule is 28/28 on and off so i don't feel alone during the work.becase after 28 i will be with my family.My supervisor allows me to work indipendantly."
good,Great company to work for if your not a family man if you are a family man most likely not for you  2 weeks on 2 weeks off wasnt good for me but i also had a newborn when i started
good,Great job if you are okay with being away from your family. Pay is good and everything. It's nice to learn something new all the time. They take safety VERY seriously and that's awesome.
good,Very fast paced in some situations. Great company to work for if you like getting your checks on time everytime. Never bounced. Could help a Little more on boots and have more expensive uniforms.
good,"14 days on 14 days off"
good,"Good work schedule. Great benefits , they are a very safety  oriented employer! Competitive pay. Leader in drilling technologies and equipment. Great team  atmosphere ."
good,"Great company to work for"
good,"It's fast paced, hard work, but you earn your paycheck. The company takes care of its employees and is very safety oriented. All in all its not a bad company to work for."
good,"At the Helmerich & Payne fabrication facility they have the building split up into bays. A,B,C,D,E, each bay has a different build. You get assigned to a area you work in with a team. The nice part about it is its not really repetitive. They have a lot of different builds that cycle through but you normally dont repeat the same thing back to back. Everyone I worked with there was easy going and helpful."
good,"I had a daily routine of facing challenges to problem solve issues for electrical components of an oil rig. I learned how be part of a team to solve problems by a deadline to get the rig back up and running so there was not a lot of down time on loss of drilling for oil. I learned that several components must work together for one operation."
good,14 days 12 hrs a day average 84 hrs a week for two weeks then you get two weeks off. Co workers are great like family. I really enjoyed this work and job and I hope to find something I can enjoy just as much.
good,This is an awesome company to work for. They have competitive pay and really take care of their employees. They provide insurance and have goals when you reach certain limits. They provided me with living quarter and an overall excellent experience.
good,Great company to work for who really cares about ypu well being and what their reputation stands for and how to uphold that reputaion.
good,Great company to work for that values the employees. If you don't have a problem being away from home this is a great place to work
good,"I have really enjoyed my time here at H&P, everyone is very friendly and willing to help each other out. Very family oriented and great ethical and moral values."
good,Can move up relatively quickly as long as you work hard and take every opportunity given to you. The price of oil does affect your job status
good,Most days would fly by no matter what the day ahead held. I learned a lot about drilling for gas with all questions answered by co-workers and or management. The only hard part of the job was putting up with the rare bad moods from tired or stressed individuals. Tripping pipe was the most enjoyable.
good,"it was a great learning experience I learned all of the in and out of a great and 10,000 employee company. I met a lot of really great people and really enjoyed the experience."
good,"I enjoyed working for h&p, it's hard work but it was one of the best jobs I have. I was trained in working  on a drilling rig & was trained in numerous classes to help me perform my job & duties."
good,Fast pace work. Long hours. Great pay. Lots of advancement opportunities. 2 weeks of work and 2 weeks off. Hard work and labor.
good,"I worked with a lot of family on this job , but it is very physical and I enjoyed it , I learned a lot from the men I worked with"
good,Muy Buena empresa. Excelente trato a los empleados y ambiente laboral
good,"Working for H&P was an awesome experience. I learned a ton while I worked out there. People were great, and they focused a lot on Safety which was awesome."
good,"As an employee of Helmerich & Payne,I have worked 8 & 1/2 years for the company. I've been on different rig & platform. While with the company I've learn about how to communicate with other,I was fortunate to be taught by some of the best people in the company.I taught how to work safe & how to teach other what I've learn from the one's before me.I would a mentor to all that worked with or for me & respected by my piers."
good,"I would highly recommend H&P for anyone looking to get into the Energy Industry! It is a fast-paced, competitive environment that emphasizes teamwork, collaboration and excellence. A great work/life balance and competitive pay and benefits. I love this company."
good,"i was promoted 3 times in a laps time of 4 years, it teaches a person to be a team player  by communicating well with coworkers, also health benefits and insurances are great."
good,This was my first drilling company to work for. It was amazing but at the time I didn't realize how good I had it until I left. I tried numerous times to get back on with them but it never happened.
good,"A typical day is a twelve hour shift full of hard work. how to operate different types of machinery.   I learned to properly mix and weigh drilling mud.  How to maintain and fix all kinds of pumps, motors, and compressors. Gained knowledge of OSHA regulations and procedures. working with a great group of men knowing that they would help each other at a moments notice. Management was great they stayed on top of all problems and concerns with employees. there is a lot of heavy lifting involved and long hours while at work with little down time. The best part of the job is the ratio of time off. most Rigs offer two weeks on and two weeks off. O one week on and one week off. This allows for good family time."
good,Great job great people they really make sure you know and use shats going on first and most importantly to be safe. Once you have that down you get room to advance
good,Worked here for years amazing company to work for. Anytime an unexpected situation happened I was able to either leave to handle it or come in late with no problems. The crew became and still is my family.
