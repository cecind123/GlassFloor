rating,review
bad,"Worked here for 3 years, and by that I mean toiled away long, miserable, and grueling hours with zero appreciation or support. Back stabbing was the unfortunate norm, catty drama ran rampant from toxic people who all hated their jobs. Not only are you supremely under compensated, but you are expected to regularly work 10 hour days and work on weekends too if needed (warning that it is always needed, as you will do the work of 2-3 people and eternally be struggling to keep up). Comments that you are drowning with no help are completely ignored and dismissed. You will be given absolutely zero development plan or promotion opportunities, and management is extremely unprofessional and inexperienced. People often make up rumors, gossip, and drama out of boredom and frustration. You will get used to how regular it is to see people breaking down and crying from stress. No one cares about how you feel, your manager will excel in making you know how disposable you are. I was once begged to take an open role because I had the background needed, and then at the last minute told it would be a title demotion and was asked how much of a paycut I would be willing to accept (though it was a ‘great opportunity’) - as if my experience was worthless and I should be thankful they asked. Zero value in your work or skills, you aren’t even treated like a human being most of the time. Only when leaving did I realize how much better your life can be with a job that actually treats you with respect, with coworkers that are well adjusted and happy. Won't find those at URBN!"
bad,"Cliques. Favorites. Unclear policies. Unprofessional management. Bad pay. Sneaky and shady operations from district manager. Literally no HR in the company. Awful, awful experience."
bad,"I work for the largest urban outfitters store, overall it’s the worse experience, all my managers are coke heads and are racist. Literally only white people move up in the company and if your of color and in leadership they’re fearful of saying certain things to you. All my managers have disgusting attitudes, our security guards are constantly racist toward our guest. Not a great environment the only positive thing about this store are your  coworkers they’re  a great attribute but other than that i would not recommend this ."
bad,"The two week training program is a complete joke. Every time you have a question, they say ""oh its situational, you'll learn as you go."" Then.. when the situation happens and you reach out for help, you are ridiculed for not knowing how to ""do your job."" The pay is absolutely miserable; under $19/hr and you can't negotiate. The workload is almost impossible, daily deadlines, and stressed out about letting people down. There is no ""team"" environment. Everyone is in it for themselves and will throw you in front of a bus if it means they can look good to their superiors. You work with buyers daily yet you feel like its you against them.  Supervisors judge everyone. Everyone judges everyone."
bad,"I was promised advance placement, but once the managers got replaced, the communication went down the toilet. The general manager is a micro-manager. They do not care about your health. I have asked multiple times to raise the heat and they leave it cold resulting in me coming into work sick."
bad,"Urban Outfitters runs off of corruption, sabotage, manipulation, greed, favoritism, double standards, hypocrisy and its ran by a bunch of scandalous, selfish, children. It’s also a very hazardous place to work. Between the poorly stacked non-con that’s consuming the warehouse that could collapse and crush someone, the dust, the rust, the black mold, no air conditioning and how mentally and emotionally toxic the place is. Absolutely terrible. Poor management. Garbage."
bad,"Do not waste your time and energy "
bad,"They treat their employees horribly.  The ones with no work ethic get promoted, the hard working are ignored or taken advantage of.  When I worked there, I frequently skipped my lunches and breaks due to a misguided devotion to my position. My reward was the expectation that it would continue. My experience and knowledge was disregarded when management changed and when failures occurred that I had advised would happen, it was blamed on me. I would not wish this company on my worst enemy."
bad,"Very depressing and racist company, I would never recommend anyone to work here unless you’re  desperate for work. No room for growth unless you’re Caucasian."
bad,very crazy work space. Unorganized and too many employees. Not enough hours. Too many temporary workers and negative attitudes.  It was just a quick job for me until I found something more solid
bad,Working for urban outfitters was like being in high school. Very young people with no drive for success. People looked very unprofessional reporting to work. Didn't seem as though the job was valued at all.
bad,racial profiling customers that shop within the store manager was very rude using personal relationships as ways to gain promotion placement in the company despite the hard work of others
bad,Did not like the job. didn't train very well and everyone was rude. Holiday time was very hectic and we did not have the proper amount of staff. Great discount though
bad,"Urban Outfitters is a good company but they don't offer much. Most of the team members are very friendly and easy to work with, however management there wasn't the best, to me they showed favoritism, they almost treat the people under them like they are beneath them. Which made my experience with them very short, I wasn't really feeling the vibe their so I had to separate."
bad,"it was nice hip job to work at but the hours are not good and they pay is minimun to little to live in san diego ca , it was a fun job in my younger years"
bad,"Management is awful, coworkers are snotty, just an overall really awful place to work. Was paid minimum wage for copious amounts of work. Expected to carry weight of others who don't do job."
bad,"I started my journey with the company in hopes to begin a career path that ultimately became the carrot dangled in front of me on my path that lead to no where. The company structure is that of psychological manipulation and condescending deception.  A false team structure environment combined with a seemingly criminal under-compensatory structure aside I tried to remain optimistic that the promise of my on the job training would one day pay off.  The shallow veneer of progressive, forward thinking empathy  hides the true nature of the company which is mired in greed, nothing is what it seems."
bad,at first the management were okay then peak season came and they lost theyre  heads. moving people where they dont belong. firing the good workers and keep the bad ones.
bad,"This was my first ""real job,"" so I didn't really know what I was missing out on in life to begin with while working at Urban Outfitters.  The hourly pay rate is horrible... not enough to live off of.  It was a good ""first job"" for me that led to other opportunities."
bad,"""Stick to what you know"" is hardly a motivator for anyone looking to excel in life. There needs to be more consideration for team efforts. Display Artists used to apply their skills to each build and installation. Its now become more of a fabrication-based job that requires them to manufacture fixtures on the ready. The fact that so many DA positions have been eliminated has created a shift in responsibilities and workload. They report directly to someone ignorant of what the DA can actually do. The DA deserves a Manager who also works in Display. The company should have created Display Teams who can travel throughout their Districts and work on projects together on a constant basic. That team should receive direction from its District Display Artist who can plan projects accordingly with the District Brand Leader. I just with the DA had a voice in this company. There are zero DAs in an positions of authority, with the exception of the corporate team, and thusly there is no one in the company who can speak up for them which leads me to believe that the people in charge can place blame on unfavorable results and accept credit for everything that turns out great."
bad,Das Management ist chaotisch und nervenzerreißend. Die Mitarbeiter sind launisch und lästern wann sie nur können. Das Geschäft ist dreckig und heruntergekommen.
bad,"Worst Manger's  worst interview in my life ! "
bad,The environment you're involved with is a very biased environment and does not like to allow the work place to conform to the diversity in political viewpoints.
bad,"They promote workplace favoritism if your over 25 your not going to move up or be treated with respect the managers and leads treat people like garage they also ask you to perform unsafe acts to do your job "
bad,"Starting from a boring job to the pay that is a joke. And what else is a joke? The management! Or a lack of one. The ""management"" consists of people on the playground coming to work to play on their phones and not do what they actually are supposed to be doing."
bad,I worked six months on work placement/Internship.  They offered me minimum 8 hours contract at the end of my Internship.  You can't survive with 8 hours contract.  Very bad management.  I had to quit the job. Bad communication between management and staff.  Low pay as well.  Repetitive duties.
bad,"Very slow work environment, not really any room for growth within the company. Management is very unorganized and unprofessional. Promotional opportunities are scarce."
bad,The company does not pay well. It's customer service. I had to work overtime up to 60-70 hrs a week to make ends meet for my family. It was difficult.
bad,Horrible staff. 
bad,This was my first job and I absolutely HATED it! Do not ever work for Urban Outfitters. Management is complete trash and they pay you minimum wage. They are also very racist.
bad,"URBN is not a good company to work for. The management is not great at all. As he walks about on his high horse and makes the agent feel like a spec of dust. He yells are you all the time. Also, if you move departments, such as going from a phone agent to email, you have to do both. You are way over worked and under paid."
bad,The work was dreadful and the clothing produced by the company was far below par for the industry on top of being very expensive. I will never work for this company again.
bad,"Although some days were fun at work, most left me in tears. Management does not care about their employees and pick favorites. If you are not a favorite, you are treated unfairly and poorly."
bad,"Not a great job, it's boring, you're on your feet for hours upon hours, there's no clear direction of what you should be doing, it takes FOREVER to close the store"
bad,"you will be a slave, cleaning up after everyone including other coworkers. little or no room for in company growth if the wrong ethnicity. pay is not enough compared to the companies."
bad,"Such a negative environment. If I could give less than one star, I would. The management could not car less for their employees, you would be lucky to get HR to help you with an issue in any sort of way (including harassment). You will be lucky to get even a 5 cent raise within a year and if a family member dies, just forget about it because they don't have a grievance policy."
bad,"I didn't like the energy in the workplace, I felt like it wasn't an equal opportunity workplace, in the end it just wasn't for me. Hopefully others have better luck"
bad,"Not a great company to work for do to low pay, low advancement opportunities, and horrible upper level management. Was unable to change my schedule even after being a top performing agent for quite some time."
bad,They barely give you hours and arent nice. They only give you a 10 minute break which is absolutely nothing. The money you make barely pays rent.
bad,"A typical day at Urban was crazy. The company had to many people in charge, no order. I learned how to pack ,stock and etc.....My co-workers were wonderful."
bad,Horrible company. They don't care about you as a person.  I would never purchase any thing from them. They ship out used dirty clothing. Management is extremely disrespectful and do not talk to there employees. Most employees come to work high or get high in the parking lot. 90% of employees do not speak English. If you have a family this is not the place to work. They do not follow labor laws.
bad,I love the clothes. I worked for them for a period of time in which I felt over worked and under payed. Moving up is difficult and the pay is just awful for anyone who is outside of highschool.
bad,Urban Outfitters is not the kind of company I would ever want to work for again. Their employees are underpaid and under appreciated.
bad,They don't have good management and they don't know how to treat with employers. They just taking advantage of been manager
bad,"A lot of work and great co workers, great music and great discount. The hardest part of the job was handling the customers."
bad,"Processing returns, maintaining store, and covering peoples shifts."
bad,"Questionable business practices combined with poor management is the unmistakable formula used at Urban Outfitters. From unethically scheduled shifts, schedules published only 30 hours in advance of your shift, and minimal if not nonexistent breaks, Urban Outfitters is one of the most stressful and unfair places to work for. Next to no advancement, no annual raises/reviews and scheduling spread so thin that you can't even get a potty break covered without going through the hassle of getting a manager to cover you on the floor, if you can even find a manager, that is."
bad,"The managers play a game of favorites. You can't live off this job, as not a lot of hours are distributed. Best part is the 40% discount. Managers are inexperienced and not interested in keeping a happy employee. Great job for newly graduated highschooler, or someone attending college looking for something to give them very little extra weekend money."
bad,They couldn't even spell my name correctly on my checks! They never smiled at employees and made it hard to get good hours.
bad,"The bridge is never on the same page, u get different information every time u call, Bridge never want to take calls from cst wanting to speak to manager, having to tell cst to wait 3 bus days for emails abt resolutions was annoying cause as a cst I wouldn’t want to hear that, be prepared to be cursed at and yelled at everyday cause the way the system is set up csr are the ones getting negative backlash"
bad,This was an enjoyable job. The wages was way too low for the work we were expected to do. The working environment was good fun and the staff were a good time to be around and made it a very fun place to work
bad,There is no consistency AT ALL.Everyday you come to work there is something new that you need to do or learn.No one EVER seems to be on the same page and they don't value their employees on ANY level.
bad,"I worked there for almost 4 years and was promoted 3 times. For most of it I had amazing managers and a team full of great friends. However management moves around a lot so you're stuck with whoever wanders into your store. I didn't get so lucky in my last year there. We had a store manager that literally did nothing all day and made it know that she wanted associates to be afraid of her. It went from a really cool/fun environment to work in with sub optimal pay to a really depressed workplace with sub optimal pay. No brainer, I had to leave. Not to mention when I put in my two weeks I was immediately the subject of all the managers talking poorly about me in their private chat with each other. I was their most veteran employee who proved himself time and time again and they had no problem treating me like garbage. Don't work here. It's not worth it."
bad,"A typical day at work would be maintaining the sales floor constantly, sweeping dust bunnies and greeting every customer. If in fitting rooms you would be in charge of counting items, placing customers in their fitting rooms, writing their names and checking fitting rooms for security tags and price tags. I didn't learn anything new at this job. The management is very shady and talked about employees behind their backs to the store manager (I overheard them speaking in the morning) and to other employees. The shift leads are very nonchalant and behave as though they are an elite clique and the sales associates are beneath them. The workplace culture made me very uncomfortable as I was being treated like a new hire with no retail experience. The hardest part of the job was being subjected to snarky comments by management and not being able to speak up due to an open-door policy and expected to do the impossible through contests that were easier for other associates (trying to get customer shout outs via a survey on the receipt and the cashier kept winning - the cashier has the opportunity to casually mention the survey). The only enjoyable part of the job was the employee discount.  I was fired 40 minutes into my shift and the manager insulted me, shamed me  and lied to me about why I was being terminated by stating ""my priorities were not in line with the priorities of the company"". I was also terminated in front of an shift lead hired a week ago. I felt like an example was being made of me. It was completely unfair."
bad,"I worked in the UO flagship store on Oxford street, management are rude and patronising. Constantly expect you to cover shifts for them but do not want to listen to simple requests from employees. Overall, they want you to put in your all but they dont care about you. You also never leave on time, often getting kept behind for 2 extra hours when closing due to poor management and lack of staff."
bad,"you would usually be on the same section of the floor for atleast 4 hours of the day making the day drag, management was not organised, pay was not justified for the work you had to do."
bad,"I sweat and bled for this company for over 8 years. The turnover was insane, the pay horrendous, and the company repeatedly violated labor laws in order to maintain extravagant upper management salaries and profit margins. I was happy to leave and cut my losses."
bad,"I worked at the Urban Outfitters in INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA at the KEYSTONE MALL. My staff member were very racist towards me. It was to the point where people who came in to shop would come up to me and tell me they would never shop in that location again. The pay was okay $8.75 starting but I had to go after hours were cute to 6hours a week and racist co-workers took it too far."
bad,"Customers are rude, management sucks, hours sucks, staff sucks"
bad,"It's not the ideal job for people with children. More for college students and senior citizens looking to make a just enough pay check. Management is cool. I was happy to work here at first, but I just couldn't force myself to work here any longer."
bad,This place sucked no need for a review because I would never eat to work for a place like this. Terrible pay short break terrible management it was kool at times but not much
bad,I’ve never worked for a company so uninvested in their management staff. Complete bullies everyday and nothing done to stop it. Awful culture. Is not a customer oriented brand. The brand sells itself. The most customer interaction you have in a day is asking if anyone needs anything from you & even then you push it off to someone else.
bad,"I promise you, don’t work here lol"
bad,"The turnover rate for this company is unbelievably high. Since I have started and worked for three and a half years, I have gone through four managers, three supervisors and three assistant supervisors. The company can not keep anyone employed, and it is no surprise. "
bad,If u like the life of a call center mixed with women n politics be my guess. Also they have a point system so if a family member dies bringing the obituary won't even do.
bad,"Worst job I've had so far. Employees are not valued. Work environment horrible. Management is extremely bad. NO communication at all. Managers treat you like a number. They don't value employees when they want you to leave the company they stop talking to you. Some managers made employees cry. Seriously the vibe is bad, If you don't need to work there don't apply"
bad,"The Lexington location is a huge mess. The culture there is if you are bffs with management then you’ll be given opportunities. If you go in and do your job above expectations don’t expect any recognition. Also do not ever get on the bad side of management for any reason or else you WILL be pushed out. Ridiculous, full of previlaged, awkward and entitled people. Everyone is young, it is like joining a high school cult."
bad,Wasteful company that does not development their employees and lets the product sell itself. Was actually asked not to actively sell and was told to “look better than the customer.”
bad,No a good place to work and the salary no good for what you soppos to do
bad,"A typical day at work involves me hearing managers talk negatively about both employees and customers. I have never been told I have done a good job, only told what I do wrong, which makes me depressed and not want to go to work. It's a very toxic environment and I feel like I am in high school again with the catty-ness and gossip. I feel as if I am being prevented from advancing in the company due to personal opinions about me by management."
bad,"Management is horrible, they would make you feel misrable and replace you than try and correct any issues that would keep a quality worker from staying. Never worked somewhere where the employees feel so unappreciated."
bad,"They employ you then work you like slaves.  I wouldn't wish this job on my worst enemy.  Hours were horrible, you never knew your schedule until the day before, management talked to you nasty while cursing and yelling."
bad,"This isn't a job that you should aspire to do if you are college educated with a degree. In addition, in most cases management have shown a tendency to let stereotypes seep into the way they perform their job."
bad,It's who you know. Come in get told to go one job by one supervisor then have the other one yelling at you because they wanted you somewhere else. Asking for more work or to learn something new they will ignore you unless you are one of their people.
bad,"Bosses talk untrue stuff about associates about their backs, do not give the legal amount of break time, take advantage of associates and admit to it,"
bad,"Not a very good place to work and I would not recommend it to anyone. Very poor management, very intolerant of the employees haveing a life. The hr department dose not come out of the office for any reason."
bad,employees not respected or treated fairly. Not paid well enough. A typical day involves walking around the store and keeping everything neat while servicing customers.
bad,Place was a good place to work had some management changes and the new managers are all clueless led by a senior manager that is a bully and tries to rule by intimidation. Building director is never there to notice the bad environment. They put many people in supervisor positions that should not have been given that role. Lot of innapropriate relationships there also but they turn a blind eye to that also. HR thete is a total joke.
bad,"The management have no clue what they are doing, communication is next to nothing, employees are not appreciated, long hours with no benefits, low pay, I would not recommend"
bad,The job is easy and fun. The management sucks they are rude at the Augusta call center. They don't take doctors excuses or if something bad happens in your family even if you have PROOF they will still give you points. The job is off of a 6 month point system you will get pointed once you reach 100 points your job is gone if it's before that 6 months. If you're just in need of money go ahead and apply but I wouldn't recommend it.
bad,Urban Outfitters is known for being unique which they are. What you do not realize till you are in is they use you till they cannot or you are not a YES man anymore. They are sexist and there is to much politics when it comes to advancement.
bad,"in my opinion the most over worked yet under paid and under appreciated company I have ever worked for. unprofessional and borderline illegal hours of work and work load. the quality of the products were poor and overpriced, the mark up was the most crazy I have ever seen in a shop and the worst team work I have ever seen."
bad,You have former Gamestop managers as supervisors at Urban.
bad,"This was my first job ever and I stayed for two years and a half, working at two locations. I was often told that there would be promotions and raises, but kept the same salary throughout my time there, but not for lack of effort. The management at this company is incredibly disrespectful with their employees, and expect associates to dedicate their entire lives to the store. I would say that for someone who is looking for a first job, go for it, but do not expect to grow in the company unless you are friends with the right people. Effort and work performance do not matter to your managers."
bad,"The company has a terrible attitude and management of mental health illnesses. "
bad,"I'm a personable, hard- working person. This place is managed by stand-offish 20- somethings who are unreceptive to employee concerns/ideas of improvements for the perspective better of the company. They appear annoyed. Training = minimal. Layoff hard working temps without warning or reason while keeping foul- mouthed, unprofessional ""suck-ups"". Odd vibe. Unstable company with lots of worried and unhappy employees, a lot of whom have begun looking for work elsewhere."
bad,"Such a soul sucking experience.The job cares absolutely nothing about the employees. It's all about the work and nothing else. You're told that they advance from within but the only way you advance is by being a real brown noser. They don't go by your work ethic so no matter how well and how hard you work , if you dont play the ""game"" , they look right over you."
bad,"In the two years that I have worked at Urban Outfitters I've gone through 4 store managers and all of them have been caught for taking money from us by cutting lunches or something like that and my last store manager was completely rude to me would not let me move up in the company like I have expressed that I wanted to since I got to the work there. There was no hours, management puts all their work on you and you are expected to do things that people are paid more for so why should you do it because you are paid minimum wage. Played favorites, managers only care about money, they just want warm bodies on the floor, terrible place I would never ever go back to"
bad,it was an ok place to work really just keep to my self wile there.did have meals for us some times like for holidays like thanks giving christmas. didnt like how clocking in and out worked had to wall a long period to time clock
bad,"I was ambushed by my boss and offered a severance package with no notification and forced to resign, because I feel my boss wanted to replace me with another individual with a lower salary"
bad,I wanted to work here so bad but once I got in I encountered a very different setting than what was said to be expected. It truly is working in something similar to a sweat shop. The employees were very aggressive to one another causing a tense and uncomfortable environment. It seemed to me that everyone was watching everyone assuming theft from every employee. The managers lacked communication and had no training with the job itself. It was chaotic and unorganized and dangerous to me.
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was the working for the company>
bad,"Management will promote you within a year if your looks fall under a certain criteria. Also, you can work your rear off to nowhere if above is not met"
bad,Don't recommend and not a good working environment. To much favoritism. Would not recommend anyone to work here. Management was not fair and had their picks.
bad,If you could give half a star it be ample. They only keep you on if you're related to someone there or sleeping with someone there. How hard you work and attendance does not come into it.
bad,"This job would be easier if the training was not 4 days long and they put you on the phone not knowing what to do. The pay is great but honestly, it was not worth it. You have to handle 5 different brands phone calls from their customers. The system is difficult to navigate. The only good thing I can say is that the employees are really nice and you do not have to dress up. It takes 3 months after training to get a schedule that you want and that is if the 7-4 person does not want their schedule."
bad,"As a sales associate it's a fun place to work, Team leads are expected to work as hard as a manager but without the pay. Managers pretty much live at the store."
bad,"I started work at urban on Monday, I was trained completely wrong and not given all the rules of the workplace correctly, so I made a few mistakes but this is why they have a 3DAY training period, on my 3rd day I was fired because I wasn’t doing it fast enough"
bad,"Best thing about UO is the team. Some great people their from all over the US and the world."
bad,So much to say don't even waste your time with this place they hire and fire people for no reason. Every single one in management needs to be replaced...so evil and nasty .
bad,"You work from 7:00am to either 3:30pm if you work eight hours but if it is what is called ""peak season"" you will get off at 5:30 pm and that is for first shift. Second shift I have no knowledge of it. And I also only know about just one department and it would be Inventory. I also know that you do not wear any protective hearing wear to protect your ears from the noise of the convayer belts that brought plastic containers down to be reused and the noise of the cardboard box bailer that was running all day. And also the noise of the forklift's horns that pass by. You deal with things that have dust all over it in my old department. And if you weren't careful you may get cut with broken glass of a product that was sent back to Inventory. The only enjoyable part of the job is the friends you make in your deparment. I wouldn't include your supervisor though. I would not reccomend working at that plant."
bad,"Busy, management chose favorites. Not a company I would go back to. I dont have much of anything good to say about this company. They will lie just about anything to cover themselves"
bad,"Everyone is unhappy at Urban. Managers HAVE to want to be there and work, most aren't.  Not the best place to work if you want to grow. Better experiences outside of Urban."
bad,It's a good place to start if you're in college and need retail experience. I wouldn't want to stay long though. The management and team is great. Tasks are okay but sometimes there is an insane work load and it can be exhausting and I felt underpaid. Store is super big so it got really messy. Customers are sometimes hard to deal with. Closing hours are terrible.
bad,"Zero Work/Life balance-You will come in to 700 emails sent overnight by your panicked coworkers who are just trying hard not to get fired or screamed at by the psychopaths they report to. You will start staying up tile 3 am to out-do them. You'll lose your friends. You'll get depressed. You'll walk along the waterfront at lunch and consider just jumping in to end this horror. "
bad,upper management does not care about the employee's. no room for advancement.  normal call center issues. poor scheduling.  plus side there is no uniform. That can also be a bad thing.
bad,"Lead you on and lied to you about 2 promotions that were promised but never followed up on, didn't get a raise after a year of working there, unfair hours, awful management."
bad,"Only white managers, except for token Managers that speak languages of the majority cultures working there that do not speak English.  While they push your quota per hour, which I would do and exceed at times, most do not and do not intend to and stay in their positions making the same per hour as I was making.  You finally cannot take it anymore.  They do not care if they lose hard workers."
bad,Coworkers aren't friendly. Everything was extremely unfriendly. Managers were power hungry and would yell at you for whatever reason they could find. Would not recommend.
bad,vibe there was good just not great to employees.  they made us do shipping for online orders in store as well.  that was challenging  and we had no payroll.  Also our store manager was literally the worst.
bad,the worst place to workk. a bunch of kids and dummies. i wouldnt recommed  to nobody. no raises and and everybody sleeps with everybody. word
bad,"Worst job experience ever"
bad,"Managers were very rude and disrespectful. I came into work to go shopping with a friend, and I hadn't been scheduled for a while, and a manager came up to me and asked in a rude tone ""What are YOU doing here?"""
bad,"Please do not apply for this company, trust me it's not worth ur time, they're not honest, truful or loyal to their word, they tell u anything to make u happy n the next minute it's not true, this is not a real place to work for, it's a hussle job, not a real job. They write u up for anything, i mean anything, to get u fire. It's not a fair job, it's a terrible job, so please take my advice don't think twice about applying for this job, if u want further information, I be gladly to give u what u like to hear, This is definately a slave hole, please don't apply for this company, it's not worth the money."
bad,In my department we have many responsibilities because we ship the merchandise to the customers.Everything must be palletized right because they are already paid for by customers.
bad,"Management is awful. The company doesn't care about employees. You can search up about prior scandals with this company. Everything sucks about working here. Pay, environment, everything. The employees are cool though. And the discount is awesome."
bad,"Low pay. "
bad,this company does not promote from within or provide even close to the amount of growth they promise. the management is messy and extremely unprofessional and favors their favorite associates heavily. the workplace culture in this location is entirely toxic.
bad,"Not the best experience working for the company "
bad,"Everything I learned was trial by fire. 100% of how I was trained was by asking another associate ""How do I x"". Management likes to shrike off responsibilities of teaching the associates how to do things. They complain when you ask questions and gossip to fault with associates. I watched them pressure people into working off the clock. "
bad,This place is not far if you are friends with management then you get to move up and if they dont like you they are out to get you out of the company.
bad,"I was promoted very quickly within the first two months of working there and it being my first retail store I was thrilled. I now realize that I was hired out of favoritism which was something I was really hoping UO didn't have. I put up with extremely inflexible hours, drama and gossip about EVERYONE, managers not communicating to each other, loosely followed rules that they would occasionally decide to implement on people they didn't favor, and this sense of superiority that managers and other long time employees would abuse against newer associates. The manager that promoted me left randomly and the new store manager thought I wasn't trained enough to be team lead so instead of training me they would gossip and I would find out about discrepancies they had with me from other associates. Also when a manager was threatened by a fellow manager while at work the district manager instead of firing him for threatening someone proceeded to interrogate the victim manager and myself who witnessed it as if we were making it up, a really awful situation to be in. They ended up transferring him, honestly it was because they liked him and he had been there a while if I were to guess. If you go to a manager to complain about gossip they just tell you to ignore it, it is ridiculous. I loved working here for the discounts and cool employees but the management is so awful and the overall training process is so flawed there is no way to advance in this company unless the managers personally favor you."
bad,I worked the warehouse and running around to pick orders was fine but the management that was there and how fast they wanted you to be was almost unachievable from how the warehouse was set up. I had so many people get fired or yelled at when I would see them working harder than me but they still weren't going fast enough. I could handle it but it was a hard job to have with a young child.
bad,"I worked at Urban Outfitters for a little over 2 weeks and was treated with so much disrespect by the management team. I learned that Urban heavily relies on good customer experience (totally understandable) but they would make me do A LOT and I only got paid $11, so at the end of the day I had to decide if it was really worth it. I felt unwanted."
bad,"My overall experience at UO is one of constant micromanagement with no serious molding for those coming in on an entry position. Everyone is left to figure out their job for themselves while management often tends to lounge in the office and back stock picking and choosing who to show favoritism to. If you work at UO it's not for long, because the hours given to part-time employees aren't meant for those to stay there unless you have a different income."
bad,"wages too low, too much is expected of the an employee and the company offers no benefits; they barely want to grant paid sick leave."
bad,"1.   5/6 hours shift no break."
bad,"It's a good job to have as a college student if you are into that culture, but there is a lot of drama that comes with all the people because they are mostly young people that work there."
bad,i was hired for shorthire. i was never called after the first day. i was not given a schedule. they used me for one day. very horrible team and management.
bad,"Recent changes in company structure implementing more tasks on to store levels.  Removal of visual positions, high expectations on salaried employees."
bad,Hard working managers and hard working individuals. Especially my coworkers I would say we dedicate our time to this store  more than anything.
bad,"On the outside Urban Outfitters might seem like a dream job for anyone, it has a coffee shop, attractive co workers, and a ""culture"" all to itself, Looks can be deceiving after nearly four years of my life, i was injured, working with unsafe equipment, and underpaid.To the outside world this company looks beautiful while internally it neglects and destroys its backbone."
bad,"Like many retailers UO eliminated most of the creative positions in the stores, putting more work on current employees.  There are not enough district or regional managers and nobody is leading the visual procedures in the stores.  Corporate Office communication is shoved out, messy, and reactionary.  There is a lot of busy work and documenting for upper management. UO used to be a company that treated employees like family.  That company culture left with most of the tenured employees."
bad,"people in charge not nice to anyone, , always cold. they didn't care about anyone's health, so many different cultures. management do not do anything just sit and play games on their phones, they don't sort any problems out."
bad,"long hours not a lot of motivation from management, frequent rude customers are hard to deal with. not really permitted to pitch new ideas in work place."
bad,"during the time period i was there, management was extremely poor and unreliable. associates were not held accountable for actions. supervisors were given the most responsibility with the least amount of help or guidelines. everything was unorganized from the floor to backstock. while i was able to keep busy and grateful for my full time job, i was not able to sustain a living and after expressing my concerns and fears, they were met with silence and eventually termination. I was singled out for my latenesses because i stand up for what i believe to be right, fair, and just andwhile i was fired for it, countless of other managers, team leaders and associates werent even so much as warned for their actions. when i went beyond the store level, i was greeted by nothing but rudeness and no one willing to try and help. this company is selfish and is going to fail."
bad,"I worked for this company as a sales associate for almost a year. For an extremely long time they only gave me on-calls and said it was because their were no hours to give. They were lying, the store employed over 40 sales associates, and only about 10 of them were consistently getting hours; people who have worked there for over a year would literally get one on-call a week, and this would go on for months. How did they decide to solve this? By having open group interviews and hiring more people. They do not care about their employees and will show you no appreciation until you decide to quit, and they will hire 5 people to take your place (and these 5 people will take hours away from everybody else who have been working there for a year)."
bad,"Good company, hard to move up to management, easy to keep position after holiday/seasonal employment."
bad,"Very busy location, will constantly have tasks so no chance of getting bored or not keeping busy. Not a lot of room for moving up in the company unless you're friends with the managers in charge of promotions."
bad,"Management was the reason why I quit. Favoritism showed in the workplace, and scheduling was unreasonable. Commute to getting to work was ridiculous. Teamwork & communication was very coherent in the work place which was one of the highlights of working for urban. Employee benefits were very generous as well, however clientele for this specific location are self entitled, rude and slobs."
bad,"Company is very stingy with payroll and there are always 1000 more things expected from you than you can complete on your own, creating a very stressful environment. Corporate and upper management don’t understand the lack of visual merchandising support at the store level. Company direction changes far too quickly, piling on more impossible expectations that leave you feeling like a failure. "
bad,"It's a regular retail job, if you aren't part of the receiving team; handling heavy boxes without protective gloves nor decent conditions in stockroom amidst terrible in-store temperatures. Would not recommend for a first retail job."
bad,"Managers too focused on things that are not always a high priority which led to frustration, tension, and disgruntled employees constantly expected to work as a team. Too high of expectations to get things done when we are limited in our positions and restrictions."
bad,"the managers are terrible. the job was overall easy, but not worth the pay. no room for advancement and managers played favorites. If you want a nice discount on their overpriced clothes, then it’s a good place to work. Otherwise, work anywhere else."
bad,They never took taxes out while I was working there and now I owe money to the government. They don't care if you are sick and excuses don't excuse you. You still get reprimanded.
bad,"Flexible hours, discounted clothes, poor management, few hours, unless a lot of people quit, or it's holiday season. Image based culture. + cheap pay."
bad,"A typical day of work...slave job, unskilled brutish work."
bad,"So, if you want a job where you get virtually no real hours and an excess of unpaid ""on call"" shifts that prevent you from having any kind of life (not that a life would be any fun anyway, because you will be unable to afford food and will be digging for scraps out of the trash next to your new home on the park bench) then this is the job for you! You do get a discount on all the hip merchandise, which you can share with the fam. That's a lucky break because you certainly can't afford it yourself. Incidentally, they will let you wear goodwill clothes to work if you look sufficiently UO. Needless to say, wearing used clothes makes it easy to blend in among the rows of new clothes made to look used...well I guess they call it ""vintage"". My coworkers were all great there though. It is the company itself which likes to pinch pennies and over hire and put the unnecessary employees on call so they can pay the absolute minimum number of employees needed on an hour by hour basis. God forbid they pay an extra 7.25-8 bucks to their squalor-dwelling employees. They say you get fewer on call shifts if you stick around long enough, but I was quickly wasting away and couldn't stick it out."
bad,"I never got any kind of official training on applications, procedures, schedules, company culture, expectations, etc. I was expected to learn everything either on my own (impossible), from another assistant buyer who was equally overworked as myself, or by my reluctant boss who sighed and sucked her teeth if I asked for clarification or to be shown something again. Sometimes intentionally leaving me to sink or swim and complain about my ""underperformance"" to her boss."
bad,"Cons: Supervisors are young and clueless. Given a point for being 1 min late. Fire ppl for little to no reason but kept a couple people who bs all day. Dealing with dirty clothes. Work is very boring and repetitive. You’re stuck doing the same thing everyday. Very quiet"
bad,"Long days, over stressed and under paid for said stress"
bad,"poor management and very stressful, cool coworkers but you arent allowed to talk to them because they prioritize sales rather than employee welfare. its a horrible company"
bad,My time working at urban outfitters was an okay experience. It was very fast paste and hard working job you have to be commited to the job because if not you won’t succeed also you need to be an on time.
bad,"working environment with customers was fun, 40%off discount select brands, TERRIBLE hours, shifts, and management. coworkers and team leaders gossip about employees, manager plays favorites and doesn't work around your schedule. great place to work if you don't mind being disrespected by your manager/coworkers. unrealistic advancement opportunities."
bad,"The biggest problem this company has is that there is no HR."
bad,"I was there from the beginning of the new DC being built in Gap PA.  In the early days of the warehouse they appointed people in management positions because of their seniority instead of hiring the person most eligible for the job and kept them in their positions even when it wasn't working out making for a very poor and frustrating work environment.  Don't misunderstand my meaning either, I had no intention of being in any of the management/leadership positions but myself and other coworkers had to clean up many messes made because of their not being right for the job.  They also were not transparent about the amount of mandatory overtime resulting in overtime being called whenever they wanted even if it was the day of, resulting in 6-7 days a week 10 hrs a day being the norm instead of ""occasionally"" and very little wiggle room way allowed if you had prior engagements.  To put this in perspective I was hired for the shift of 8am-3:30pm Mon-Fri, but they owned me from 8-5:30pm Mon-Sun making it hard to maintain your private life with just enough time to make dinner, workout and sleep, you either worked the mandatory overtime or it was the door for you.  It would be one thing if they warned people before hiring but they don't and claimed there would be voluntary overtime and very little mandatory.  The only time we had voluntary OT was in the first 3 months of the warehouse opening, after that it became mandatory for months on end with a couple normal weeks here and there to keep everyone from losing it and remained that way until the day I left 3 years later.  This review"
bad,"poorly run but great work colleagues. no work life balance, appalling pay, its made up slightly by the 40% off but theirs only so many jeans and fairy lights that can make up for it."
bad,"Personally at my location my managers sucked and made false  promises to promote or give you a raise/more hours."
bad,"As a company that regularly exploits the creations by communities of color, working with Urban wasn't an entirely enjoyable experience. A typical day includes employees leisurely walking around the store, usually folding graphics or associates finishing projects left over by the visuals team. At 3:00 every day, managers have a meeting at the front of the store, adamantly ignoring all pages on the walkie for any assistance the associates may need. The 40% discount is not worth the irritation."
bad,Company is not good to work for. Job is based on point system and you get dinged for everything. You can show up for work everyday and get points off for going to the bathroom or being in the wrong code.
bad,"A both challenging and difficult work environment based upon the perceived culture of the company, compare to the reality of the goods and services they provided. Visual presentation took priority over customer service."
bad,I worked during the holiday season. All of the employees were pretentious and rude. I worked the sale room primarily which mean  I was picking up and hanging the same shirt over and over again every five minutes. Only perk is 40% off merchandise which was awesome.
bad,"Fun vibe, cool people. Not great work/life balance. Customers can be really awful, and the management is hit or miss. Lots of standing for many hours. They definitely see their employees as expendable. Fine for short term, or if you're really passionate about retail and wanting to move up in a company."
bad,The store would open and everyone was assigned to a spot in the store anywhere from 1 to 4 hours depending on who was there. Closing was very tedious. Clothes had to be stacked perfectly on top of each other.
bad,"If the management had let me do my job and left me alone, I maybe would have stayed for the no dress code deal and the discounts. However, the management made my stint here intolerable. I was chastised for things I didn't know were wrong because no one told me, and the task direction changed every minute. I was told to do a thing, so I did the thing, and the next day I was told not to do that thing and to do another thing."
bad,Great work environment but very poor compensation and no room for growth unless your willing to relocate. Good discount but management needs more training.
bad,"Not the type of job you would want if you have a family with children. In my opinion they are not family oriented due to the hours you must work.However, there is always room for advancement and their benefit packages are really GOOD."
bad,Urban Outfitters was a fun and productive environment but due to new management it feels like a monarchy. Management do not allow associates to have a say in the day to day tasks. If associates are involved it is due to favoritism and only those employees will be given the opportunity to have a voice.
bad,Push a table back and forth scanning product make sure it gets ship out to customer that order items off the internet making sure its pack out correctly
bad,"Working lead for picking is all about staying on top of the orders that will be droping on your shift. Making sure that you come in early to get up dated on what has already been droped so that you can clear all unnecessary items out of the computer. Keeping your crew motivated, also knowing the right people to assigned task to, know all you members weakness and strength so that everything will be balanced."
bad,"This company is one of those companies where there is clearly something wrong with the ethics and the employee manager relationships. When I first began to work there I wondered why all of the employees just seemed drained but then after about 4 months there you very much so understand that what is asked (or should I say demanded) of you is ALOT given how much money they pay. Not to mention my coworkers were not only lazy (constantly calling out) but the managers would get stressed out and lash out on the employees. I was so glad when I left this company. They either need to up the base pay for employees or make the work experience worth dealing with, maybe in doing this their turnover rate wouldn't be so high."
bad,"If you are an Operations-based employee, with less of a focus on Merchandising/Visual management, you will not be appreciated at this company. In an effort to stay relevant, merchandisers, with no people-management skills or experience, are being put into General Manager roles, in an effort to save the business by being visually innovative and ""trendy"". Dealing with aggressive shoplifters regularly is incredibly stressful. Company culture is dominated by favoritism and an inability to have constructive conversations with someone to their face. I am a grown adult who felt like I worked at a high school."
bad,"Everyone is lazy because the head manager is lazy. Management never helps with any of the duties on the floor. rules got stricter and stricter but didn't make any sense for business. My coworkers were cool, but that gets old fast"
bad,"This is a job that started off fairly enjoyable but as the weeks went by, the tone in which I was spoken to by certain members of the management grew more and more condescending and made me feel as if they thought I were an incompetent idiot, which was a huge knock to my self esteem. At the end of my time at Urban, I missed two of my shifts due to psychological illness (Something that had be discussed weeks previously with a member of management)  which also left me unable to report my absences,. On both occasions, I was not contacted by my employers to inquire why I was absent, which shows complete disregard for the safety and well being of their employees. The worst part was when the management tried to claim that they'd tried to contact me on both occasions and that i'd failed to return their calls. This was a complete and utter lie which left me feeling rather insulted. I was left feeling unwelcome and disposable. "
bad,"Have worked there for two years. Got promoted once and one pay raise. Now working 10.75 and hour full time which doesnt pay the bills. Work my ** off to compensate for the management at my store. Work environment is stressful and not team based. You either get it right in their eyes or get ** on for one thing wrong. Only so many holidays off and if you ask off for more than two days it's a big deal. I asked off for maybe four days in a row to travel and the way the schedule happened to work out I had to work 9 days in a row full time and apparently it was my fault. If you're sick and need to use personal time it's a big deal. If you work 6 hours a day you only get ten minutes to sit down and eat lunch. If you work 7 or more you get at minimum 30 minutes. And get written up if you cant find someone to cover you. You do get a good discount but the amount you get payed compared to how much you work and how expensive everything is it just goes back Into the company. Maybe im just unlucky at my store but home office does nothing to fix issues.  If you're looking for a family oriented, team based job look somewhere else"
bad,"Urban is a huge brand, but they are surprisingly disorganized and don't provide their stores with any real training for new hires. Because each market is separate by district & region there is a lot of inconsistency. Despite this, you do have some people who take pride in their teams and building them up to succeed. Unfortunately, it takes a really long time to get anywhere substantial in the company as there a little corporate advancement opportunities for store level associates which isn't ideal for people who want to pursue corporate retail careers."
bad,"Aufbau eines Pop-up shop"
bad,it didn't pay enough for me and my family and it was hot in the summer and cold in the winter months. I worked a lot of hours to make up for the lack of pay
bad,"If you want a job that cares about you and your success, Urban Outfitters isn't the place. Full time employees do not receive a consistant schedule and the pay is hardly livable. They care most about bottom line. It's a good job for part time employees in college/out of college because it's pretty flexible but it's not a good job for people looking to make a career."
bad,"Working at urban outfitters was exactly how one would expect it. It was a regular retail job at a very hip and fashion forward store with very fun coworkers and a great discount. That's the extent of it though. There was no room for advancement, favoritism, a lot of gossip, it was unorganized and lower level employees had very little respect. I would recommend applying there if you need a short term job. The employee turnover rate was incredibly high so subsequently many of the people who applied were hired with little thought. I left there because I found another job that was good to me and valued my hard work. If you apply for a sales associate position at Urban Outfitters just keep in mind that you will most definitely be disposable."
bad,Urban Outfitters has a very forward-thinking company culture and fabulous product. I learned a lot about time management and merchandising standards there.
bad,Business had its up and downs but when it was busy there was a lot of work to be done. The best part of this job was being able to help customers get what they were looking for.
bad,It was ok. Just another job that pays the bills. They expect alot with not alot of wage to back it up. Job security is not the best. The entire Merchandising team from head office all the way down to store level was let go this year.
bad,I worked for Urban Outfitters for a ear and I was going into the company wanting to ultimately work for home office. The company does not care if you work for them for 20+ years. Many of my  mentors who have been there for 21+ years got treated like trash and fired within a week. Seven of them. If you are looking for a great discount and a job that will let you go nowhere this is for you. If you are wanting to grow and see a career in this company you are looking in the wrong place.
bad,"Great job if you're 18 and in school, but your hours are all over the place, a lot is demanded of you for poor pay. The culture there is great, I am still friends with many of the people I worked with, but it's an exhausting environment."
bad,"This company has changed a lot over the years. I have learned many invaluable things from Urban. People, visual standards and creativity used to be at the core."
bad,"In a nutshell I do not feel that this is the best company out there to be working for. But if you are in want or need of a fast pace job and full work load when the supply of work is great, then this may be the job for you. If you push for it you are able to learn many things about the company and the different jobs within the building by asking any questions that you want to know and ponder about. In my experience with working for this company, the best workers are the ones who come in and find ways to keep themselves busy when they have breaks in between their usual work. The hardest part of the job is when we hit our slow time of the month, due to the lack  of work people may get sent home early if they are not able to keep busy. The most enjoyable part of my job as a collator is the vast knowledge of information that you learn with the job and the satisfaction of being able to help create work for other employees both in and out of your department."
bad,"Great customers, great music. Shifts are extremely long sometimes and managers need better management training. The music selection is great and the products sold are very cool."
bad,"At Urban Outfitters, the managers were known to pick favourites and single out employees who didn't work to the certain managers needs. They would harass employees and make them feel worthless when they carried out a task incorrectly. All around, I would not recommend Urban Outfitters for a student looking for a part time job, as it feels like you are constantly pressured to fit into a cookie cutter image that you can't be."
bad,"The management were terrible, they never listened to me about timing and would be very unprofessional towards staff on the shop floor."
bad,Be ready to put in a lot of late hours and be challenged. Amazing office to learn and be creative in but not the best training and development in place.
bad,"Extremely unorganized and lacking in communication; cuts down on productivity and makes the work place frustrating. There are some really good people working here, but there are also some extremely petty people who ruin it completely. They also higher people randomly, 4-5 people at a time, but there is already barely enough hours to be distributed to people who have been working there for 2-3 years."
bad,"keeping my work space clean and presentable and provided excellent customer service to every customer. I've learned to improve my customer service skills and to make every experience special to the customer by making every interaction fun and personal. management declined when the new store manager came in, which in turn store moral declined. co-workers from urban outfitters were very unique and diverse, great people that are very artistic and expressive. the hardest part of working at urban outfitters was dealing with upset customers and the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and keeping up with the latest trends in fashion."
bad,"I learned it's all about who know. If you try to prove you are right; you are more likey to get fired, they let foolish people move up into management. They dont work with student's schedule. Supervisors on second shift act like children. Some my co-workers were okay to work with. The hardest part of the job is work with people who act like the CEO, and pick at you. There is no enjoyable part. A new rule everyday, get blamed for other people mistakes. Get fussed at like we are children"
bad,It was an okay experience overall. The store managers did the best they could to work as a team but the pay was minimum. Decent discounts for employees and culture was diverse and easy going.
bad,"The team itself was super fun and welcoming, but the management at the time was atrocious: very cold and rude. It seemed that they did not make an effort to incorporate everybody in the store - very distant with their employees and their customer..."
bad,When you first start working it’s nice.  they take in consideration to your schedule which is cool no questions asked and your co workers are nice For the most part (sometimes cliques but that’s to be expected because of the kind of brand your working for) plus you get a 40% discount(not really worth it Though with the pay you get) . There are more cons than pros starting off with the fact that they are SUPER UNORGANIZED and don’t train you correctly at all which results in them (management) getting upset if you need help (my training session was supposed to be one on one and in a breakdown of 3 days..I ended up being trained for about two hours with another new hire that was ahead of me by a day then just thrown to work on the floor with no knowledge of anything really except to pretend to look busy). Management has a few nice ppl but others are pushy and very passive aggressive about things if they don’t like you or like what you’re doing. YOU WILL GET FIRED IF YOU ARE LATE MORE THAN ONCE (they give two warnings then fire you) and calling out is nearly impossible if you can’t find coverage because the manger on call will hassle you about why you can’t make it and expect you to keep them updated if you can’t find coverage (you also get warning/write ups for this). Last but not least during dry season you will get no hours (you will be working like once a week with a 4-5 hour shift) unless you are constantly covering shifts for people on top of that they over hire so there isn’t many hours In General to begin with . In general the work vibe is okay I guess. Definitely a job
bad,We worked 7 days a week/ 10 hours a day. No time off except for normal holidays. We were always told abide by managers orders or get fired. There was NO time for family or anything else.
bad,Didn't enjoy working in Santa Monica very poor management with borderline racist tendencies. No common sense in most of the managers (the few that were good either left or were transferred). Urban Outfitters should be a chill and enjoyable job (still low pay) however the management goes through great lengths to be incompetent and out of touch with their workers.
bad,"Management was lazy"
bad,"There isn't a good work life balance.  Over the last few years they have cut many rolls, but still expect all the same responsibilities to be done.  It is very rare to have good management that supports advancement. "
bad,"Although i love the people i work with , the managers are approachable and the work is easy. There is a lack of motivation for advancement , there is no holidays made available it's painfully frustrating trying to request a day off . it pays awful , your roster might be put up 3 days before youre meant to start the week and you're on a minimum 8 hour contract"
bad,who really cares. Do you need a Job? APPLY!! It might be perfect for you. the people are super cool... you might hate a couple of the managers and you might love others. try it out.
bad,"the most enjoyable part of the job was the couple friends i made and the days that i was not scheduled to work. a typical day would include me doing my task but over the years the management fluctuated, my first year the management was awful, i had falling outs and distaste for almost every manager but in the last year it has gotten a little better than before. i learned how to talk to people and break out of my shy shell that was really difficult for me"
bad,"My UO experience started off positive and easy-going, but at some point, the people working there showed their true colors and were disrespectful and rude to myself and some of the managers. The passive aggression and condescending behavior created an unpleasant working environment. During the interview process, the company made it apparent that it was an inclusive and friendly space, but it was actually quite the opposite. It felt like high school and even middle school at times with the lack of maturity and professionalism and ""cliques"" that would talk poorly about others. There was also a lack of advancement and growth within the company when it came to moving up or trying to increase your pay wage from $7.90/hour. I would not recommend working at the Lawrence location if you are looking for a part-time job."
bad,"Honestly a 5/10 ten, the pros and cons balanced out even-stevens. Not a one, nor a two, nor a three, nor a four, but a 5 out of ten - just to get to the word count."
bad,"I enjoyed myself with the company when I first started, but the job lost its way with me towards the end - turnover is high, and the brand itself is too mainstream now, making UO itself lose the novelty it had a decade ago. Made some awesome experiences with customers and associates however, but the culture needs a radical makeover."
bad,"The company was great to work with in 2016, but in 2017 the management changed and many changes were made to our system and has been made challenging,"
bad,Advancement and with in the company is nothing more than a high school quality popularity contest. i enjoyed the lack of dress code. credit is rarely given when it is due. No meaningful incentives out side of ones own pride in their work.
bad,Terrain was amazing. Urban is a big company so advancement is competitive. I loved working for terrain. Working in an actual urban outfitters was horrible.
bad,A typical closing shift could have you sometimes working up to 2-3 hour past your shift ending with closing store procedures and scheduling mishaps cause a lot of “clopens” to occur where you work till late light and are expected to be back to work the very morning form opening procedures.
bad,They work you like a dog and don't care if you're sick or a family member is sick. I worked through a temp agency and they even treated you like you didn't matter.
bad,"Work is not hard at all . As far as leadership goes , management is terrible. . The pay is a good start considering the lack of work People get away with on a daily basis @11.25/hr  . Benefits are one the  good things of the company . They do offer really good plans . And at pretty fair rates ."
bad,"This company is quick to break standard protocol when it benefits them - such as denying vacation days the day of a vacation when said vacation was already approved a month prior. On top of that, the management is terrible. They'd much rather higher 50-100 temps per month that will only work a few days before quitting than actually give their employees that have worked there for more than 5 years a break by hiring people that will actually take the job seriously. The management at Urban Outfitters is the reason why the Trenton South Carolina plant is closing down."
bad,"Urban Outfitters is a great place to work."
bad,"As a full time employee, a typical work day would be a 7am-4pm shift during the weekdays, and different shifts on the weekends. During the morning I will perform tasks such as cleaning, receiving shipment, and merchandising before the store opens at 10am, at which time focus is shifted towards the customers."
bad,"I worked in the Call Center in Trenton SC, they train you for one week and the throw you on a phone with no one to help you. I wonder if this company gets some kind of a kick back for quantity hired. People are let go all of the time. They accused me of something that I didn't do, I believe they have their Warehouse and Call Center down here so they can pay a ridiculous low wage, it is straight time no overtime for working Saturday or Sunday. Main office is in PA which doesn't have the labor law as here in South Carolina, which is they can fire you and not have to have a reason. Their computer system is really bad, I feel sorry for the customers, getting someone elses holder or not get everything they order. No way of advancing in the company because you will be out the door before you can even think about it. I applied for a different position and a person that had only been there a month was given the position. Of course her brother who does nothing but bad mouth the e-mail department works there. I would say if you work there don't ever order anything because they and go in and make it look like you did some on your order that you didn't do. Then when you ask to see the proof they tell you we don't have to. If you do apply and get a job, keep looking because this company has the worst management, communication and pay of any company around."
bad,"I worked at Urban for a good amount of time to know and say they aren't what they say they are. Your schedule for inbound will never be 6:30am-3pm. It's non stop 6:30 to 5pm! Not enough time for appointments, bank and basically anything else that closes at 5. One thing wrong and people will spread rumors faster than you even know it. Management and supervisors won't treat everyone equally. Safety is their ""#1 concern"" but in reality they don't care if you get hurt cause they won't pay or help with any future medical bills. No matter the reason for being 1 minute late or even 5 seconds to clock in they will still give you an occurrence! The pay isn't worth it and neither are the yearly raises. Same job skills are needed at different jobs with BETTER PAY and better management, better environment overall. Don't stop here to apply, keep on looking."
bad,"Honestly, I loved the discount I recieved as an employee. The work pace was very slow but the environment made up for that. I was able to get in touch with my creative side the most."
bad,"getting good pay rate from beginning of time,working condition is not so safe,overall its averageAssociates are fun, great people. Discount made clothes affordable. Customers generally very nice, easy to deal with.Cons.Being on call- doesn't give much respect to employees. Sometimes called before a shift, that was not on call, to say they don't need us. Hired over 20 new people for holidays when they were already struggling to give current employees hours due to lack of business. Management is lazy -- they sit in their office and watch videos for hours, all while getting angry at us for asking for a 10 minute break. They would just…"
bad,High energy workplace where job duties often varied based on cutomer priorties. Constant push to assume more responsibilities which was not a real problem. Challenging atmosphere to work in but a busy day is a fast day and that suited to a tee.
bad,"Long, unpredictable, and exhausting hours with very little pay. Even with the good discount, you can barely afford the clothes you spend all day selling. This is more for a young, social college crowd looking to make very little money on the side."
bad,"Despite creative, casual culture, it's a retail environment that means folding clothes 75% of the time.  Room for advancement for people who want to stay in retail."
bad,"Typical day at work would be managing production and keeping track of errors, meeting guidelines and deadlines."
bad,"From a customers POV it seems like a great place to work, neat products, cool vibe BUT the workload is HUGE. I've been in retail a long time and have shopped at Anthropologie for a few years but I never imagined working there would be so hard. There's constant go backs from the fitting room, stuff to fold and candles to restock. What I hated most was sizing and resizing the clothes all day and then after closing, sizing the entire store. That's what made the job miserable b/c after closing you can't go home until all is sized, straightened and go backs done so we'd be there for at least 2 hours! During the holiday I got out many a night or morning at 1:30 after closing at 10!!!! In addition to all that a few of the mgrs were stuck up and rude. One of the operations managers was the worst, talk to you like you're an idiot and be totally rude if you didn't do something EXACTLY the way she wanted. The store manager, however, was really professional, friendly and excellent at her job. I admired her people skills, she knew how to talk to everyone."
bad,"Great place to work and learn great customer service skills."
bad,"I worked for urban while i was pregnant and it was so stressful between customers, management and the long work hours it was all a mess. Management is terrible and the point system is even worse... they gave me points for going to the bathroom WHILE I WAS PREGNANT!!! Brung it up to management and they said i needed a note from the doctor when clearly i was carrying!! The pay is way to low for the BS they put you through."
bad,Listen this place was a joke to work for. Even though you had a 100% attendance record and your work was satisfactory you were still overlooked for a full-time position.  PS also you had to be the same complexion as the management
bad,"The store was almost never staffed correctly, the elevator was out half the time, and management was not organized. "
bad,"At first this company is great but you slowly begin to see how poorly they treat employees. There is no human resource department in the entire company so, if you have any sort of encounter with a coworker or management you are only limited to speaking about the concerns with the manager on duty. If you are a conservative, professional type of person this environment will drive you crazy."
bad,"The vibe and the people were great and we did some awesome events and they always had stuff going on for employees to submit to, but then we got a new store manager who immediately culled the people who didn't fit his standard and had worked there for literal years and rehired multiple new employees.  I worked really hard for this store because I liked it and it was a steady job with what seemed like opportunities, but still got fired ('let go') with no warning or chances to improve.  Others did as well, so hopefully this doesn't come across as a salty employee trying to get back.  "
bad,"I learned how to deal with all types of different customers. Was put in many different types of scenarios with customers, co-workers, and management staff. Was definitely a learning experience."
bad,"Good company.  Doesnt know how to hire managers."
bad,"Working at Urban Outfitters, or any retail store in general, requires you to be friendly at all times and to provide customers with the greatest and highest level of customer experience to encourage customers to return to THAT specific location."
bad,"Barely an hours, Its hard to get time off, You have on call shifts so you can't plan your day accordingly. Very boring at times, fitting room feels like a sauna if you are stuck up."
bad,"Besides not being able to have your cellphone on you during a shift, the work environment was very much relaxed. Every Sales Associate gets a paid 10 minute break per shift and you're mostly allowed to take it whenever you want, you just have to notify your manager and obviously find coverage if you're on the cash register or in fitting room, etc. I love, love, love the discount, however the pay is just not worth it. Sales Associates make $8 an hour and the work is just a waste of your time for that rate. Any other customer service workplace will pay you higher so I guess the reasoning on whether or not you might like to work at Urban is how much do you like to shop and do you mind that you're basically working for a discount and hardly any actual pay?"
good,"Very great job if you love fashion, music and art but management would have to be their biggest downfall. They focus more on their favorites than people who are actual hard workers. People have their their cliques and it shows. This also effects who gets scheduled and who doesn't (in my opinion)."
good,"Tolles Gesamtkonzept, jedoch schlechte Umsetzung. Management verhält sich unangemessen."
good,It's been fun working here. the schedule is flexible. However there's very little room for advancement. One must constantly kiss up to the managers in order to move on to better positions. the floorsets are constantly changing
good,"If you plan on working at Urban, fashion trends must be your life. I learned a lot about how to make a corporate structure feel like a boutique and that is through product knowledge and feedback."
good,"Operationally at Urban you have to comply with on demand skills and work ungodly hours, half of which are spent cleaning areas other than your own.  No work/life balance"
good,Was once a fun and engaging work environment however the business has moved from a culture that stresses creativity and expression to a more cash and profit focused one.
good,"The pros about working at UO are that its not an uptight environment. The company is about creating a positive vibe within the store that fosters creativity. There isn't really a dress code. Just express who you are. The employee discount is pretty fair. The company is also currently in a transition of the positive.The quality is getting better, they are using real leather, but with that the price is also increasing. I feel that the shift will take a while however I have already seen great advances from the company in this ambition. I feel that this breeds a positive outlook that the company will continue to get more streamlined however when it comes to operations they are decently organized but for the established company that they are they still have some obvious things that need to be addressed. Overall, if you work hard and communicate where you want to go they are very good at promoting from within! You will have to work your way up the ladder however. The benefits are only available to Management like most retail, (401K, Great health, dental and vision, life insurance, even perks like discounts at apple and other retailers for being an urban employee)"
good,dont recommend- bad work environment. no room to progress. will overwork you until you quit. will only give positive feedback but not promote. pays less than competitors.
good,"management assente"
good,"management was unfortunately condescending."
good,"The workplace culture is enjoyable. It is customer oriented. Positions are fitting room, front area greeter, and cashier. You being at entry level which is a sales associate."
good,Job security as long as the customer is happy and do not escalate to management. Keep your scores up or your shift will change. Make sure you appease your supervisor for good scores.
good,"Have to be on time no grace period, I was on the receiving docks there is always work fast paced.  I was also only a temp worker, not many benefits offered and not a big chance for career improvement."
good,"amazing culture, I hope it is still there."
good,"Management is AWFUL, so passive aggressive and not who you want to come to work for. The idea of UO is great and very open minded. But when it comes to team work, training and management, it goes down hill big time. Employees have groups and definitely favorite people, if you aren't HIP enough or don't like to be talked to like an idiot than do not work here. If you are also offended in any way with friendship in the workplace, don't work here either. Sucks management doesn't know how to do their job and pushes everyone out of the door that is actually good for the team."
good,Working at urban outfitters was fun bc of the employees & positive interactions w customers. Although I feel the management isn't very on point most of the time.
good,The company does great job of making sure that customers who enter the store are greeted and assisted continuously through out their visit. The branding idea the company with holds reaches out to different generations to satisfy most ages. However the company lacks the compassion of making sure every associate and manager in comfortable and treated appropriately without showing bias behavior with the intension to shun another associate and/or manager.
good,It has come a long ways since I started in 2013. Their raises are only yearly and are not much to brag about. There is a lot of real nice and hard working people there. I don't see myself retiring from there.
good,"Your job is minuscule here. At the end of the day it’s clothing retail, so all you’re doing is fixing up the store by putting a never ending amount of “tried on” clothes back and helping rude customers."
good,"You have to dress by their standards, although the pay plus the discount was still hardly enough to afford their merchandise. They often kept us there until 2-3 AM getting the store back together, instead of having more people on the floor before closing to start straightening up. It was not a diverse work environment, either."
good,Working for Urban was a good experience. Teamwork was always exercised daily. Customer service was always key in my time of working there. The Management team was always very welcoming and patient.
good,if you want a discount at this store then this may be the job for you. Other than that i did not fond this a very rewarding job except for the people i met there.
good,I think this is an okay place to work if you don't mind people always being down your back about everything that you do or say. Managers tend to not know whats going on.
good,"Definitely one of the most unique and creative company cultures. However, this perk does not make Urban immune to the current hardships of brick & mortar retail in the 21st century."
good,"I would not recommend, the company is struggling to give employees decent hours. A normal week is 3-4 days with 4-5.5 hours. Definitely, recommend balancing with another part time."
good,i didn't like this job at all. everyone was very awkward. they acted too goo for new people. very closed a off and management was not very encouraging
good,"Salary and hours are the biggest problems at urban outfitters. But from what I have seen in the world of retail, it is indeed one of the most interesting, creative place to work."
good,Working here was not like I thought it would be. I was given a lot of hours but the money did not match the amount of work that was given to the employees.
good,"This is a food truck, other employees were inexperienced but clearly favored. Management was rude and inflexible. The truck would get extremely hot and was somewhat poorly ventilated"
good,The shadiness that the managers at Urban Outfitters is truly unbelievable. If you just come in and do your job you won't be stressed. Don't try to advance with the company unless you have a management team that you really trust.
good,A typical work day consists of assisting customers with purchases and maintaining an aesthetically pleasing store appearance.  May work on dressing mannequins and markdowns if necessary.
good,"Had to stock the floor every morning and since understaffed, it was 10x more work to close up the store. Learned about different create aspects for running a store even learning about what customers are attracted to. The hardest part was closing the store because since it was understaffed at night and two floors of a bunch of fixtures with tossed clothing around and accessories."
good,"I learned to manage a team in a high stress no sleep- scheduled environment. I learned a lot about management, about team work, and about helping to develop people to be at their best potential at a daily basis. I also learned to juggle the requirements of fulfilling duties while helping customers and providing the best possible service.  The hardest part of the job was the unforgiving way managers are scheduled in this line of work. I lived 1 hour away y driving and often had close-open schedules. It was physically draining."
good,Een typisch Amerikaans bedrijf met een HQ in UK. DIt maakt dat de verwachtingen van de managers zo hoog liggen dat ik 7/7 aan het werken was. Op zich een leuk origineel bedrijf met grote openheid naar diversiteit en originaliteit maar alles draait zonder meer rond winst en het aantal uren je werkt.
good,"had supervisor that really didnt care about the workers, treated everyone really bad."
good,"well working at urbanoutfitters was not all what they make it seem , they tell you its a team work but most of the time your not working as a team . workers that has been longer tend to treat new workers as if they not apart of the company family as well.one thing i can say is that management does show you the ropes around the places and try thier best to make you warm up the company when you frist start. the hardest part about the job i can say is making friends with the co-workers , which is usually not hard for me since im a very friendly person . even though some workers may tend to be a little rude , the enviorment is very happy and up-beat and you get to meet new and different types of people ."
good,The work environment had to much of the employees personal issues intertwined with work drain the the professionalism from the work setting.
good,"I enjoyed most of my work at urban outfitters - there wasn't much opportunity for advancement. the workload was manageable but at times demanding when we were short staffed or when someone would call in sick. I feel like the management style wasn't representative of the workplace culture. In that we were often reprimanded for the tiniest of things such as carrying a water bottle on us or sitting down. When the shop itself had such a ""laid back"" aesthetic and attitude. It didn't really match up with the constant backlash from management"
good,"great people to work with some not to friendly, but enjoy being around the ware house staff they are very hard workers  and know how to get the work done."
good,"très agréable, collègues détendu, une bonne ambiance"
good,ok i didn’t like having to fight over hours but it was a creative place to work get setting while i went to school wish the pay was better i went days without eating
good,"Working at Urban Outfitters is good for a high school student or someone who is not relying on this job for mandatory bills. The schedules are extremely inconsistent vaguely speaking, and even when asked what your availability is, there is typically no adjustments made for it. I've worked at two separate locations and each one consisted of cliques and favoritism. When Managers and Sales Associates are partying consistently together outside of job,as well as siblings working together at the same location it creates unnecessary relations that are brought into the workplace resulting in drama. The drama always ended up creating an unprofessional environment, making it really uncomfortable to work with the other associates. On the plus side Urban outfitters allows you to create your own dress code everyday as long as you aren't overly exposing areas of body in an unprofessional manner. You will receive a 40% discount on all Urban outfitters Branded clothing and shoes, 25% discount on House-ware, electronics and beauty. You will also be given three 60% discounts every month that do not add up over multiple months at a time. Overall, the Job Interviews are very relaxed, leaning towards getting to know a little bit about who you are, what you're into and what you're capable of providing for the company in order to obtain the position. A typical day of work at Urban consists of clocking in, grabbing a walkie-talkie, asking what section of the store you will be in for the current hour. When you get your response you will go to that station and begin organizing the clothes, making sure"
good,"You meet such great, creative, artistic people at urban and that is it's only driving force. Oh and the discount is pretty sweet. However the company as a whole doesn't seem to care much for their employees and they expect you to go the extra mile when they've proven over and over that you are replaceable. Management barely manages anything. the play favorites and they hold personal vendettas. Too childish of an environment."
good,"When i had first started, we had opened up the store in Herald square, gave me one shift with 4 on-call shifts, that was a problem because I had kids in daycare. I am paying for daycare for 5 days regardless, but only receiving 1/3 of the ""Promised"" 25 hour day."
good,"I loved the people I worked with, but sometimes I felt like management could have treated their employees better. Sometimes hard to balance school with work and management did not make it easy."
good,"Got let go due to bad management of payroll, leading to an overspend and ultimately the let down of certain member of staff who had to be penalised due to this management mistake."
good,"I loved the discounts that came along with working here but I hated the short breaks and the rotations they had us on didnt make any sense. People would ask us where the vintage merchandise came from and I couldnt tell them that most stuff is bought from thrift stores, repurposed and sold at a higher price. Thats not true for everything at the stores so just check the tag before. I seen a shirt from target in there once, they put a bunch of holes in te shirt and dyed it with an ombre affect to make it look brand new. Yuck!"
good,"lowest pay"
good,Typical day consisted of processing shipment before opening the store and customer service during opening hours.  To say there is a few kinks in the management team would be an understatement.  Very cliquey. Hardest part of the job is taking on responsibilities of 3 different roles but only barely getting paid for one role.  Been encouraged by management team to apply for lead positions multiple times.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing all of the new product.
good,Excellent people to work with in a fun environment. Managed all operations of store and employee hiring and development.  Lead a team of 3 of department managers and 1 visual merchandising manager.
good,"A typical work day at Urban Outfitters was very simple yet fast paced. Working there I learned to work as a team, to be very detail oriented and various loss prevention skills. The hardest part of the job was being aware of shoplifters on the sales floor during weekend shifts."
good,This places management and cash flow is doing monumentally downhill. Avoid if at all possible. Management is often mean and condescending without positive critique to get you on track. Demands change without warning and management is constantly stressed and takes it out on you
good,"Urban Outfitters is a very creative and exciting company to work for. The company has a young and vibrant identity and constantly aims to be a market leader. "
good,"good environment,  typical retail job.  Looking for a better work/life balance.  Company is a little behind the times technology wise.  Makes it harder to like working here."
good,A typical day at urban pretty much consists of talking to customers and maintaining until the end of the shift. My co-workers are all positive people who are hard workers. They make the time go by stopping to make a comment just to liven up the day. Management is fine.
good,Was a great place to meet like minded artist. A bad place if your looking to move up. Too much favoritism and politics here.
good,Fun group of people with a good culture to be a part of.  Management is not transparent enough and plays favorites.  Team leads have an easier work balance even though they are under paid.  Shifts are rare for sales associates as they put a choke hold on payroll.  Learned a lot about the overall nature of retail
good,Too much expected from team members who were dedicated. Tasks were never cohesive and recognition was confused. A large amount of personal favoritism and horrible communication. Very inefficient and no room for growth. Negative attitude and no structure or dependability. Exhausting
good,"Every shift starts with a meeting detailing the previous days figures. I.E. customer footfall, conversion, total sales. It also involves any issues or strengths regarding the team or the working environment. Individual hourly deployment is also given in these meetings. "
good,"Fast paced"
good,I enjoyed working at UO however due to the location it was not the best experience. There is tiers of importance in the company and because our location was not ideal we were on the bottom tier with new management monthly. There was not a set system because of this. Being a collegiate athlete it was also hard for them to work around my schedule because of the constant change in management and employees. I did enjoy working there and the company was a good fit.
good,"Urban Outfitters has 22 stores all over europe.  We only had 9 people in accounts and the work load was very strenuous.  My co-workers and I worked very hard every day and never left the office on time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting a discount in the stores.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep to deadlines as when I joined they were 2 to 3 months behind paying their invoices and payments."
good,"Urban Outfitters is a fun place to work. The company is quite artsy and challenges you to use that artistic part of your brain in terms of visuals. "
good,"Great employee benefits, Great sales floor environment, Room for advancement."
good,"Part time hours unless you are a team lead, manager, or operations. Earliest shift starts at 6 a.m., and the latest you will be there if you are closing would be Midnight or 1 a.m."
good,"As far as retail goes, I would not recommend any other. Urban Outfitters is a fun company to work for, its a place where you can be yourself and be creative. The company definitely attracts a certain breed of people which makes it easy to get along with co-works since there are a lot of common interests. The management team if pretty friendly, however it can be challenging to build relationships with District and Regional levels, which in turn can slow the advancement process for a manager trying to move up. I have definitely learned how to be a better manager, how to coach in the moment, how to use my teams in a peer teaching peer aspect, how to efficiently delegate tasks, so on and so forth. I feel that the company has helped me become a better person for it. There are no typical days, really. Every day is different which is nice, its nice to not have a hammered in routine all the time. The hardest part of the job...well, it is retail. Retail is not easy, you tend to take the grunt of angry customers, the hours are not keen for individuals looking to have much of a personal life some times. You work crazy hours for holidays - but that is all retailers!"
good,"Overall, it would be a much better place to work if they had better organizational skills and more constant opportunity for feedback."
good,nothing special an had a lot of extra work to pick up for the slack of others including higher management. too relaxed in culture and no real progression. people who should have been moved on were not and allowed to stay in current roles which did not support the business
good,"the environment was cool, the co workers were very laid back and its comfortable. the work is mediocre and the pay isn't that great and the company doesn't provide advancement for poc people."
good,"UO is overpriced and they get you to reinvest your paycheck into the company with their 40% off discount. The turnover rate is insane, managers and employees alike. They will reduce your hours from 6-8 hour shifts down to 3-5 hour shifts, at that point theres no use in coming in to work for a 3-5 hour shift. The breaks they give you for 6 hours and under is 10 min and youre on your feet the entire time. There is also theft beyond belief and there's nothing you can do about it. cant chase someone down or leave the store. pay is a joke and the managers care too much on how they look for a dead-end job."
good,"upper management is not very personable, dont seem to care much about the staff. the expectations from them based on what associates are paid can get stupid. store level management tends to be quite good at finding a middle ground in that regard and they care a lot about staff happiness. you have to be 10/10 all the time or you are watched like a hawk. store management is really understanding with mental health and trying to lessen stress. really really good open door policy. hard to move up fast, most store level managers are 27+ and its hard to get anywhere which is really discouraging for the younger, more eager employees. the best part of the job is 100% the people. i have met my best friends because of that place."
good,Not very good pay. Long hours. Too many customers. The managers were very sporadic and the scheduling was poor. Some of my co-workers were rude and very pretentious.
good,"Don't get many hours, would like to have better pay for the amount of time spent there and the amount of work done on the job. Not a close knit relationship among  coworkers and managers."
good,"Worked with the company as a whole for 4 years, UO for 1 year. Came into a team of very young immature mean girls. No support or additional training from my district manager. Lots of theft in nyc stores. Associates don't care about the store, it's just a hang out spot. As a manager, that can be very frustrating.  "
good,"False hopes of growth. You work long hours and usually aren't appreciated for the work you do. You learn a lot in this role, but the management can make or break the role. If you are tasked with too much work, they continue to pile on the work."
good,The day-to-day job for me wasn't too exciting because our store location didn't get much business. I didn't feel like my full potential was given a chance to flourish due to too many employees.
good,"Shifts are not consistent; therefore if you have younger children or like to plan for events in advance this may be a difficult position for you. shifts may change daily, even during your workday."
good,Urban Outfitters was a little competitive but I met some amazing people and got some good experience. It was my first job and it really helped me learn the ropes of corporations.
good,Working at Urban is cool but working a 10 hour shift is not okay with me I'd prefer to work 8 hours. Other then that it was an okay job. Everyone was nice and respectful. I'd just prefer a better job.
good,"The company is great if you're not looking to move up in the company fast. They rarely give promotions. The company is also all about culture, family, and praising each other to make for a nice environment. However some of the team leads/managers were rude."
good,"Decent pay, unorganized company. No work life balance, no stability.  The food was great, and the customers made the day go by fast.  The work environment was too tense, and the communication between management and staff was poor."
good,"I worked here for about a year and half now and what can I say its terrible. I've been wanting a management position for the past year but, they always give the good positions to the favorite associates which is very unfair. I applied for a team lead back last year and they gave the team lead potion to a person they barely hired 2 weeks in!!! The management is terrible they do not care what so ever I had to call headquarters once because I worked here for almost a whole year I trained about 7 co-workers and did not get a raise until I demanded which is not fair while everyone else got a raise, Finally, I do way to much for an associate I should be getting paid more for what I do but, they do not see that they just pay attention to the favorites. This job is all about their discount bad pay check but good discount."
good,"I used to love working for Urban Outfitters until they changed job roles & responsibilities. Looking for a company that values creative, hardworking young professionals."
good,"As far as retail work goes, Urban has a nice feel to it, its quite relaxed and the people are interesting and generally nice. "
good,"Had to deal with sarcastic managers, and unreliable scheduling. No room for promotions and never anything confidential or any privacy. No team building either."
good,"The people that work there are all very nice and I enjoyed being around them. However, the pay and hours were horrible. This is an alright job for high school or college kids. Waiting tables would get you much more money though."
good,It is a distribution center. We work 10 hours a day 7 days a week during the Holiday season. The work is not very demanding but the hours are long. There are some good people there.
good,"Every Urban Outfitters is different in its own unique way. Shifts are either really long or really short. Urban has a great culture an has good products. Only thing is that to move up in the company is overly hard. They make is so difficult to move up. Overall working at Urban teaches you so much about organization, timeliness, product knowledge that afterwards you feel as if you can do almost anything."
good,"Cleaning was a big part of the morning, which is the case for most retail jobs. "
good,Worked there for 2 years and everything was great up until a year in when management changed. The new management lacked coordination and politics were a big part in whether you moved up or not. The turnover rate skyrocketed with the new management. My coworkers became great frinds of mine so that is something positive i took from that job. Overall a decent part time job for someone who might be going to school or just needs extra cash.
good,"It's decent especially for the discount but they don't take into consideration that your a student who may not be able to work 40 hours a week when your only contracted to work 10."
good,"Great place to work thanks to it stock and staff members."
good,"good place to work if you don't care of advancement  no chance of advancement. having to work weekends is a bummer."
good,This is a job for someone that doesn't care about making money. Folding t shirts is what you do all day but that is pretty easy id say. just very redundant and mindless.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is the campus I work on. The Navy Yard is a beautiful area. Dick Hayne has done an incredible job transforming these old historic buildings into an inspirational workplace for his employees.
good,"very culture environment, been withe the company 2 yrs enjoyed my experience."
good,"A typical day includes manual labor, but friendly interactions. Overall, its a great job to work during school or if you have a second job. "
good,"Working with Urban, Ive learned that big companies are still learning. Urban lacks systems and a direct chain of command at lower level management. Often making up new potions to cater to individuals resulting in breaking up systems. Management and employees resemble exactly what the Urban Outfitters brand caters to. Hipsters and trendy tacky dressing individuals.The greatest part of working for this company is the free spirited and chill environment. You love to come into work sometime. The free spiritedness of the company is also its down fall. The lack of a systems/communication & a direct development plan, that may propel other companies, this company lacks. They seem to be content with a slow growth. The room for growth is minimal and often just result in you being move from store to store with no real increase. Overall the company is a great starting point for first time retail manager."
good,"- This is not necessary "
good,"Anthropologie has an incredible time of staff which made the whole experience a lot more enjoyable. "
good,"I worked for urban for 2 years, I started off at a smaller store then moved up to the concept store. The smaller store was nice, pay wasn’t that great, then I moved up to the bigger concept store, got paid better but then the store management wasn’t that great. I dealt with it and loved the people I did work with though. A lot of retail jobs do have coworker drama and this company is no exception. The social aspect of the job is annoying because people end up being in clique so people aren’t as friendly at first but there are some good people at Urban Outfitters, you just need to weed out the bad guys."
good,"I wanted to rate this a 2.5 but i couldn't. The people you work with are fun and bubbly but the management is terrible. My first shift was on boxing day and i had no prior training or run down of how to do things. I was lost and didnt know what to do on ny first shift. Although the great employees that worked there took me under their wing and showed me the ways and made my first day better. A typical day is very boring and is a drag. Noone steps foot into the store. And i found myself messing up perfect piles of clothes just to keep myself occupied. Management would cut my hours at times because they didnt have ""enough hours"" which made sense because of the huge staff that Urban has. The staff is so large that you would be lucky if you got 1 single 8 hour shift. But that wouldnt be a issue if your a part time worker. Instead they would cut your 5hr shift into a 4hr shift. Overall i wouldnt recommend for a permanent position. And instead would recommend a seasonal or part time position."
good,"Company works employees 4 days 10 hour shifts.  Great for 3 days off per week.  Mandatory overtime during peak holiday season, I.e., 6 days 10 hour shifts."
good,"Flexible schedules, manager was always willing to work with schedules and school. Short breaks, no healthcare. Poor opportunities to grow within the company."
good,If you have kids URBN is NOT the job for you. My scheduled changed everyday. They lie in training and say you can pick your own schedule but that's only after 3 months.
good,"I was hired given lots of reassurance that I would be quickly promoted because of my previous experience, and told i couldn't be hired in at management level because the company was devoted to internal promotion. "
good,Clashing personalities in upper management make for horrible pressure for managers and unhappy staff. Being told to do something for the sake of doing something is the norm. No investment in technological advancement. They pay the national minimum wage in London which should be illegal.
good,Only work here if you want a discount on clothing. The day is boring and the turnaround is basically monthly. Favoritism is shown on a daily basis and have fun saying hi to a friend if they come in because you’ll be written up.
good,Urban Outfitters is a cool place to work at first until you learn about the culture of the company. The make offensive clothes and usually rip off local artists.
good,a lot of customer interaction and folding involved. moving around a lot and caring for peoples needs. switching between greeting and dressing room. communicating with other staff
good,"very interesting customers"
good,"Working retail you need patience and kindness. I remember doing inventories and being at the store late hours, ready to go home, but counting all the articles in the store. Not the best job in the world but I learned a few things about myself that I wouldn't have anywhere else."
good,"Merchandising and working with displays was great and you get to work with so many creative people it's quite inspiring, however management is catty & fake with a hint of casual racism."
good,Some employees are going to enjoy working here more than others.  There were groups of employees that only worked well with each other based on seniority and popularity.  The environment was cold and shady for the most part but if you had a great social life in the store then you wouldn't feel such shade.
good,"when i worked there it was 15 yrs ago. we were underpaid and laughed about being late and never getting fired, management was really fun and our store worked exceptional as a team. then they took our amazing store manager away and replaced her with this evil creature who had to follow every rule. Our sales went down and the employees were dropping like flies. just corporate culture like any other retail job,"
good,I felt I was left on my own quite a bit and put on the fitting rooms out of the way for most of my shifts. I tried really hard to cover all shifts even drove three hours from home on boxing day for the company and received no thanks also didn't get kept on after christmas even though I felt I was one of the strongest candidates. No jobs security at all.
good,I learned a whole lot about customer service and retail while working for UO but I also learned how hard it can be to advance yourself in an environment that treated its employees like we were in high school.
good,The work is awesome and fun and you get to catch people who try to take advantage of other people. The people are fun and interesting to work with. It is a great company.
good,"Urban is a pretty cool place to work as you are usually around cool people, nice clothes and get a good employee discount. Management at my specific store as horrible but us as associates always tried our best with what we were given. I worked at a store that wasn't doing so good so managers would come and go and things never really flowed easily. I would visit the store you want to apply to before doing so and check it out."
good,"meet and greet customers as they enter and exit the building. took customers orders. fix customers orders, bagged them out or take it to their tables. run a drive thru window and the front counter."
good,"I love my job because I love my managers and the people I work with. It's what keeps me going, working hard, and doing what I do in the work place. My typical day is pretty crazy! It's a big store and I am all over the place-- from working the shoe area, to running clothing, working sales, the cash register, you name it, I'm there. I've learned to be a jack of all trades at my job, and to be able to do more than two things at the same time when needed. I love that a few of our managers don't forget where they started, and actually help out their fellow employees on the sales floor. It shows us that we are a team, and that we're in this together. My co-workers are who keep me going every day I'm working there, I work so their lives can be made easier. The hardest part of the job is tending to all the customers at the same time, but trust me it is done, and always with the help of another co-worker, or sometimes by just telling them that it will take a moment. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing I've made a sale, that the customer has left happy, and at the end of the day, we've done what we set out to do."
good,At times it is overwhelming but outgoing coworkers always make the day run smoother. Customer service is an asset. Most enjoyable part is connecting with customers and making their shopping experience a great one. Hardest part of the job is working extremely hard for not very good pay.
good,"Decent work environment, ideal for younger people. Would recommend for people with passion for fashion and fashion trends."
good,The best part of the job was the employee discount. Employee appreciation happens 4 times a year - we get 40% off of everything.
good,"Best part of job:  awesome group of talented creative co-workers."
good,I felt overwhelmed only because I was doing a 5 person job and wasn't getting compensated for it.
good,"It was an enjoyable place to work as a student. The managment were great and made real connections with the employees, which was nice"
good,"i was with the company for approx. 3.5 years, it was great learning experience and had a great boss. really learned a lot. but there was way too much drama and back stabbing from department managers and merchandisers. Culture is very clique, if you're not the right type (hipster) you're out pretty quickly. they love to talk about diversity but only if you look the part. very superficial company."
good,only weekend work available.
good,"pay was not very good but the job was pretty fun. set schedules for co workers, assigned daily tasks to other representatives of Urban Outfitters"
good,"It is a great place to work if you have previous knowledge in this field and if you stayed in your place. It is a place for rich kids who want to work. If the staff accept you or like you, your job is safe. There is no unity, it is a dog eat dog place. They do not want a person to have the same advantages that they do. It was like walking on glass. I love the job and customers, but management needs improvement big time."
good,"Both times that I worked for Urban Outfitters I worked as a seasonal employee hired on black friday and expected to start working that day. I loved the pay, the discount, and the merchandise. The only complaints I had about the jobs were that the supervisors seemed completely uninterested in trying to get to know their subordinates, and remained very much to themselves. I personally never had any issues with anyone in the workplace, but I feet as though the environment could have been made a bit warmer than what it was. The employees seemed to want to come in, work, and leave. As far as im concerned people need to know one another in order for the real ""team"" aspect of a sales floor and retail establishment are concerned to thrive."
good,"People ok"
good,"I was excited to work in a cool, hip environment, and sell products that I was passionate about and would buy myself. After working for a small business for a number of years, transitioning to a big retailer came as a shock. I felt like a forgotten cog in the machine. After only two or three training shifts I was thrown in at the deep end and asked to supervise an entire floor by myself. I felt hardly anymore qualified to answer a customer's question than any other customer in the store."
good,"A relaxed place to work at, but there is a lot of inconsistency between management and stores. The work itself is pretty simple and straightforward, but training is non-existent. Store success is largely dependent on external factors. District and Regional level management are very out of touch, and Store Managers are a hit or miss type of deal."
good,Working for urban was great because we were all friends. That is until managers got involved with work place drama and started to let it affect everyday work. That’s the problem with such a young staff. People aren’t professional.
good,"I was previously hired at the Mall of America location in Bloomington, MN and absolutely loved my coworkers, managers and overall the way it was run. I would work at that location full time if I could. When I moved back to Boulder for college, I was transferred to the Pearl St. location. The transfer was an easy process and I got started quickly. Unfortunately, the atmosphere in the work environment was not good. The managers were always an issue and the coworkers were rarely happy to be working there.  Overall, it was a negative switch from the MOA location and I decided to leave because of these many problems. I am currently a seasonal sales associate at the MOA location (when I go home from college for breaks) and really do love it there, cannot say the same for the Boulder location."
good,"No tiene plan medico , no tienen seguridad para el empleado , la manera de procesar es muy lenta . No hay oportunidad para subir de puesto ."
good,Urban allows you to be yourself and to be bale to express your own individual style. It also has an open door policy to take in different ideas and measures to make the business better
good,I worked at Urban for a few months and my experience overall was okay. The coworkers were fun to be around and the job was fairly simple but the management was disorganized and would not accommodate to my schedule.
good,"It was an okay place to work."
good,"A typical day was exceptionally stressful, however I learned more than I could ever ask for! Management was terrible and misleading when it came to career advancement. It was implied that I would have to work more than 50 hours a week on average with very little thanks."
good,"Urban is a great place to work for. They are innovative and creative, which was great. The management however needs work and they need to tweak the regimen when it comes to that role. Higher ups also need sensitivity training."
good,Urban Outfitters is a well known distribution center. Steady work place and fast paced during holiday season. Comfortable work environment and job advancement opportunities.
good,"8 to 9 hrs days don't know when you will be leaving till the truck comes"
good,"This is a great job if you are in a creative field.  You'll meet other creative people here.  However if you are looking to move up or advance with this company then good luck, it's really hard as favoritism plays a big role at the company."
good,"working at an Urban Outfitters retail store in the center city area was very demanding and fast pace. I The customers were a breezy, yet the demands of the managerial staff was sometimes extremed. I was given a lot of closing shifts duirng my time there and we were expected to make the entire store as neat as possible no matter if it ran over our normal hours. Sales associates where expected to stand in an area some times for their complete shift with only 10 minute breaks. Standing without at least an half an hour break was the hardest part. The only interesting part of the job was getting to see the new merchandise shelved and the new displays being constructed every week."
good,I really i enjoyed this job for 1year and a half enjoy working on asseumble line i worked well around my co.worker and team leader there so i would work at another plants
good,"I worked in a shop on site, building and maintaining retail fixtures and executing floor-set design. I learned a lot about commercial design and the effectiveness of merchandising. The workplace culture was fun, but the management tended to ""play favorites"" with the staff. The hardest part of the job was trying to achieve one great success after another. It seemed like I was only as good as my last achievement. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with building materials and tools on site. It was fun and challenging."
good,Urban Outfitters is one of those places where you can be free to just be yourself and not have to play some one else. I love the clothing i love the people and overall i love the friendship ive made.
good,The workplace is scrambled and all over the place. There was favoritism and promotions were always determined whether you are close with a manager. Workload is also never divided equally.
good,"Urban outfitters has a compelling product and mission, however it is marred with notoriously low compensation and poor treatment of employees. Promotion is not based on job performance and demands are unrealistic. However there are some nice jobs to be had in corporate, particularly in tech or operations."
good,"Warehouse where you can find more bosses than needed,start 1 thing and end up doing 3 because they ""need to save money"",some supervisors and leads are really racists and the salary is low compare to the average warehouses in the area,I do have to say that for a few months is really slow and most of them you dont even get the 40 hrs a week"
good,"The management at Anthropologie was so weak, the girls were so rude to a first-time sales associate, decided to not train me and gave me so many tasks on my first day of work. On school nights I had to stay until 1am sometimes because they'd cut 2 or 3 of the girls for that shift and 3 of us would have to close the entire store on our own. "
good,"My co-workers were cool, but I noticed that my new manager was firing people of color slowly but surely."
good,The staff and emplyees really didn't communicate so everything was mostly unorganized and customers complained about customer service often. The company its self still has some work to do.
good,"very good place to start you journey into the world of work very warm and happy yet professional experience. "
good,"It was an okay pace to work, the owner's were willing to work with your schedule but the pay was never on time. but overall it was a fun place to work."
good,"Typical retail job. Good opportunities to move up to senior sales and to support management but rare opportunities to actually get into management. Only contracted hours, not days or times so difficult to plan things outside of work because your hours constantly change."
good,Amazing and fulfilling job to have as a sales associate. Management is lacking experience and there is little balance displayed within the higher ups.
good,"The time Ive spent with the company was really great. I got to meet so many new cool people and it never felt like work."
good,"I've gained exceptional customer service skills, learned how to multi task during hectic moments and became involved in the merchandising side of the job as well."
good,"Urban Outfitters is one company that i have worked for, that takes respect really serious. The companies employees and managers, I would say are all on the same level. A typical day at Urban consist of Intensive Customer Service and maintaining the store's merchandise. I would say the hardest part of the work day is putting all the stores merchandise back in place, being that its a big store finding and placing things could be a bit challenging. The most enjoyable part of the work day is shipment. Receiving new merchandise and being able to have an opinion on where the merchandise is being placed."
good,"I think this is an awesome company to work for, ideally, but the only thing is there was NEVER any hours... at our store at least. Only ""on call"" shifts where you call 3 hours before to see if you're needed and have to base your entire day around whether or not they say yes or no. Management was super cool, inspirational, and friendly. They really encourage you to be yourself. They're all about ""loss retention"" aka making us security guards who dress well. Idk. It's like any retail job. A somewhat great discount but oh yeah I'm doing slave work to barely be able to pay my bills."
good,"The Culture of Urban Outfitters is amazing. The free spirited atmosphere is what made me apply to the job. As far as moving up in the company, I found it difficult competing with other employees who might have a little bit more education than me or might be in the ""inner circle"". Other than some favoritism the company is a great place to grow and learn the ins and outs of retail. The most enjoyable part of my job would probably be my coworkers and the music that Urban sells and play throughout the store."
good,"A typical day at Urban Outfitters consists of daily customer interaction within a high paced retail sales environment. I have learned the ability to do inventory counts, register transactions, sales techniques, and store maintaining and operations. The employees and managers are easy to get along with and are very helpful of the job. The hardest part of the job was closing the store because on a daily basis there were sections of the store that had to be perfect closed. This involved making sure that these sections of the store were presentable and closed according to the company's standard. The more enjoyable part of the job was dealing with customers and helping them find what they were looking for. That alone was enjoyable in a variety of ways."
good,"I am known as a global associate. Wherever I am needed is where I would be stationed for the day. I learned about POS systems and also how to train others. The management team at Urban Outfitters is strong, friendly, while implementing task that need to be completed. The people in general at Urban Outfitters are wonderful, full of life, and boisterous. The most enjoyable part of work would be working with co-workers."
good,"The management wasn't too great at this store. At times I would ask a simple question about the cash register, such as things about gift cards and they would get annoyed. But the job was only for the holidays so there wasn't much I could say about this job other than that. My co-workers who I got hired with were great people. "
good,"Everyone I worked with was pretty nice, but it could be very clique oriented at times.  The scheduling is HORRIBLE unless you are a full time employee (which most are not).  I would have 3-4 on call shifts that were hardly used in a week along with an actual shift if I was lucky.  Sometimes they wouldn't even bother having me on the schedule untill the weekend.  They are also a fan of scheduling people to close saturday night, and then open early sunday morning.  I think most scheduling problems had to do with poor communication amongst management since the same person did not make the schedule every week.  I honestly didn't learn that much working here, other than how to perfect fold.  The best part of the job was the 40% discount and the fact that your family and one friend gets a discount as well.  The company also has also benefits, but once again thats only if you are full time."
good,"A day at urban is answering incoming calls, customers placing  orders, tracking there packages, paying for there orders, answering questions that a customer may have, helping the customer in which ever way possible & transfering calls. "
good,Dealt with corporate employees on a daily basis which built partnerships across the board
good,Expected to spend 3+ hours standing at the door and folding clothes and fixing them while at the same time greeting customers and making sure no one steals anything. High amount of theft that is blamed on employees.
good,It is a really laid back place to work at. They have good benefits and they really take care of their employees. Pay is average and the call volume can be up and down
good,"Urban outfitter was a cool environment to work at while I was there & i learned a lot about customer service & how to run a retail business. From inventory to marketing and branding, it was a nice learning experience."
good,"Its not that there is much to be done about it. But most of my time working there was spent waiting for something to do, also having to deal with so much theft from customers were frustrating."
good,"Working at Urban Outfitters was a fun time. Most of my coworkers were fun and nice to talk to, so were my managers. Corporate was very annoying to deal with in certain situations that had to do with the employees, but it didn't matter. Working at the store was still fun no matter what."
good,You make great connections with your coworkers. I’ve been here for 2 years and have made the best connections in my life. Work is rewarding though demanding.
good,When it comes to urban you will either end up loving or hating it. To be fair you meet a lot of cool people and they are very understanding and flexible when it comes to part timers but you are expendable and favorites are played and that’s a fact
good,"Urban is great because they really truly do hire like-minded, genuine people. I haven't hated a single sales associate and I have worked at a couple different Urban Outfitters locations."
good,"Management was a mess sometimes, tough on workers and lack of security & cleaners is annoying because you end up doing it all yourself but the customers are overall really nice, the workers are nice as well & if you like the stuff they sell, you get great discount perks. A fun job if you don't mind the rest."
good,Ambiente di lavoro competitivo e stimolante. Ottima azienda
good,There was never a lot of hours here. Very slow paced no room to grow I worked here at one point. Very low payroll only time you get good hours are during the summer and holidays.
good,lots of favoritism   no communication  management was  horrible managers doesnt even give you a chance to show them what your'e  capable you are  .. beside that the place has great paid time off vacation
good,"like any retail job there is pressure to be fast paced to get work done, and the stress of handling customers. hardest part of the job is being on your feet the entire shift"
good,There is a chill environment with people who share the same love for clothing and accessories. you make many new connections with the customers as well as employees and gain some friends along the way.
good,"This job was okay, retail is kind of boring just going around picking up after people and fixing everything people have just thrown around. You get to meet really cool people and help people get a better fashion sense."
good,"The structure of the company changed about 2 years ago. Started @ corporate; eventually trickled to the store level. After the restructure, all visual roles were eliminated in the company minus the ones in a store (if the store made over 2.5 million a year, don't get me started on the Display Artist role). Instead of have a District Manager and a District Merchandiser; they combined the role to a one District Brand Leader (DBL). They chose one of the two people in role and whoever was better, got the new combined DBL role and the other left the company (there's only one visually inclined DBL on the entire east coast). This was for regionals, stores, etc."
good,"Only worked here part time because of my availability. Was completing college throughout my employment. Vibrant work culture, great coworkers. Relaxed environment."
good,"• learned how to multitask between projects "
good,The job was pretty fair I liked working with the customers a lot and being a greeter at the front door. Back stock for the main floor and shoe lounge can be a lot to deal with but still alright overall.
good,I worked as a sales associate for Urban Outfitters for the summer. They had me work the fitting rooms and it was clear they did not want to spend the time to train me on the register. Management wasn't great.
good,"Great experience, great colleagues. I learnt how to deal with stressfull times and heaps of work."
good,It was only a temperary job. Everyone was nice and everyone was helpful. Perfect if you need a part time job but can't work a lot of hours. I had this job while in college for winter break.
good,it was an ok place to work the communication could have been better and we could have had more team leaders with open ideas. Lunch break could have been a little more organized but over all the job was good at best.
good,I enjoyed my peers but the management was not on one accord. The pay was low for the work we had to do but I did my job without any incidents. The pay was low so I took a better position
good,I had a pretty good time working at Urban there's good clothes discounts the staff is pretty laid back 
good,"Train others, pack, cover for the flow, cover for lead, pick and be an SI Clerk. I learn to calm other and helped them to think before making a mistake. I love that I could learn new things if I asked."
good,"unfortunately the directors and managers at urban outfitters are not experience enough, most directors and upper management are not well trained in the industry and don't understand the day to day task. Upper management lacks basic industry skills."
good,"huge flagship store. once you are housed somewhere as an associate you are there until the end of time. if you work in shoes, you are stuck in shoes. if you work in the fitting room you are stuck in the fitting room. not much shuffling around."
good,This is something you only want to do to kill time or for networking purposes only. The hourly rate is surprisingly low. And the raises are nothing to get excited about. However the discount is amazing.
good,"Staff can be quite mean behind your back (including management)."
good,this was my first job in retail. I had a blast. l loved my colleagues. They were super dope. the store discount came in handy at times. ill never forget the fun times I had there.
good,"It was a good starting job. You don't receive many hours and the pay isn't great, but you get one heck of a discount and you'll meet life long friends working there. Get ready for favoritism, seems like you have to compete in a popularity contest to get the best hours. Besides that, It's a great experience with different areas you can showcase your creativity."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing everyone who worked at urban outfitters have a opportunity to express  themselves through their love of fashion music and art.
good,"Nice place to work , working there learned how to drive stand up forklift, how too treat people, checking scan gun to locate product, good hours , good hourly pay"
good,"Sales associate must be able to handle heavy foot traffic, have organizational skills, assists several customers at once, minimal styling knowledge needed"
good,this is a fun and interesting place to work. however you must be a confident individual as there is a large amount of employees. the management is good.
good,packing item that was order in timely manner. make sure working station is clean before leaving for the day. keep up the fast pace enviroment to make sure orders will be sent on time
good,"The store and their products are great! The hours however, were not. Your average day can go from 4am-12pm, or maybe even 12pm-12am on weekends. The people that work there are good people, but sometimes the amount of stuff you actually have to do is not worth the pay as a sales associate."
good,"You work with a lot of amazing people and the work culture is great. However, the work politics become a bit taxing. Very high turnover so if you're a seasoned worker, you're always training new people."
good,"Upward growth is difficult right now and this is pretty typical in Retail. If you are young and looking to start your management career, UO is a good place to start.  If you are have a family, I wouldn't recommend. UO is the best of all retail environments to work in because they tend to use creativity in the workplace."
good,"Great place to work, 40% discount was a huge perk as well as the three 60% off items per month.  Great company with awesome opportunities and fun people to be around"
good,A typical clothing retail position. For the most part employees are treated fairly and with respect. The workplace culture depends on the store location and store manager.
good,"UO was a lot of fun. It is a unique store that allows you to express yourself. The team I first worked with was great! Welcoming, energetic, responsible with a lot of strive to make the store grow. Slowly people started leaving including managers, that it was not fun or a good place to work. New managers started caring less, hiring associates with out properly training them, or just being lazy and not doing the job properly."
good,they expect your life to revolve around urban outfitters. some locations are very unprofessional when it comes to the shift schedule. they pick favorites.
good,"It is an easy job and a good environment, but they do not give you enough hours to make a decent wage. They are very unorganized and seem to hire people based on looks"
good,"I probably spent more money there than I made, I learned some great customer service skills and the employee discount was pretty great, but I didn't see a lot of full time employees really practicing any customer service skills"
good,"Great customer interactions as well as horrible ones. The theft is out of control. I love the coworkers I have, everyone is super different and you have the freedom to be who you want to be at work. The upper management is really off putting and it's almost impossible to be compensated for your hard work. Minimum wage, and working almost all the holidays and weekends, for a good discount but that's it. At least I have lifelong friendships I've made through coworkers and customers. The benefits are also really good."
good,"-it is draining when constantly doing a lot at work"
good,"I worked at the 5th Ave location, I'm actually one of the many who opened the store and what a week that was. I learned a lot of skills that I took to my jobs after."
good,"The people are amazing, but there is absolutely no stability. The management turn-over rate is extremely high. The company is fairly new in Nevada (direct ordering: about 4 years), so they are still trying to get all the kinks worked out while their business is growing and expanding."
good,"Nice environment, but not enough pay for the amount of stress. Able to advance to other parts of the call center, but have to have supervisor sign off and that is not always easy when you are an asset to the supervisor's team. Management is awesome and understanding."
good,"The job itself is a basic retail job. Staff discounts on clothes are great! A good job if you want to go into visual merchandising or management. I found my peers very laid back and great to work with, not so much the management."
good,"I worked as an IT support analyst for about half a year. URBN hires great people and the work environment is low stress outside of peak season. But the job was paying very little considering the amount of work we were handling. And our hours would sometimes have us working 12-9pm and then 7am-4 the next day. Which is rough for someone with a long commute. "
good,"I have only worked here for a short amount of time, but it's basically the same routine. I greet customers, fold clothes, and put clothes away. It's nothing too exciting."
good,"I loved to stay busy, and this place was always moving. I really enjoyed working with all the people. This was my first warehouse job and it was a lot different than what I was used to but I did enjoy it.  It was hard working the peak season, because there were plenty of packages shipped,and no room for errors.  This was not my line of work, and after experiencing this I have decided to go back to the medical field"
good,"Loved the people I worked with. Urban Outfitters was extremely diverse when i first started. New management changed everything. I wish this job paid more. I would have stayed for more money. I gave them 4 years of my life my first born child and they still wouldn't give me benefits."
good,Great but loud. Family owned. Had internal family issues that made the work environment stressful. Since it was a restaurant there where no option for health care benefits.
good,"Very busy facility, unfortunately short on staff. We have been working 6 days a week/12 hour days. I work with a very diverse staff and truly enjoy my coworkers. I will work whenever needed and until the job is done, but would be grateful for less then a 70 hour work week. "
good,"A typical day at Urban would consist of early morning cleaning, with your daily crews choice of music and even dress attire. Unpackaging new product. Tagging and folding or hanging new product in best suited areas in the store and providing customers with the upmost support and service. I learned a lot about new clothing companies, style names, fashion, inventory and shipping proceedures. I would have to say learning all these new things was intriguing and fulfiling and all around enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was getting them to work with my other full time jobs scheduling, and having them not mistreat their on-call shifts. But over all this company is fun, it's a great job  to come in and express your creative style, gain customer service, fashion, and retail experience."
good,"Urban Outfitters est une très bonne entreprise pour se lancer et évoluer très vite, beaucoup de taches diverses reposent sur vous ce qui est un réel gain d’expérience en un temps record."
good,The environment here is really awesome. You can work productively and still feel like you're having fun. The people are great and there's always something new to learn. The music that plays in the store will have you humming and dancing in your head while still getting a lot done.
good,Working at Urban Outfitters I picked up some great customer skills. I learned how to handle pressure and multi-task within a deadline. My co-workers and I formed a great team which ultimately lead to a well-run and enjoyable atmosphere within the workplace.
good,An interesting and somewhat fulfilling positions. Learned a lot about customer interaction and how to handle very stressful situations.
good,For the most part a easy fun work environment. The managers were young but still did a very good job. I would work there again.
good,"Creative and social environment. Efficient duties to maintain. A lot of customer to employee communication!  Fun learning new trends and keeping up with modern fashion. Sometimes a bit strict for retail, but as a high end store and big company it is expected."
good,Fun place to work with an abundance of trendy friendly individuals working toward similar goals. Focused on company and individual development.
good,"Urban Outfitters benefits are great. I would take advantage of their 401K, health benefits and FSA tax holding for any medical care. ** Some departments have difficulty with upward movement and proper managing. Be prepared to not be compensated competitively. There is a lot of competition trying to get in and not a lot trying to get out **"
good,"A typical day at Urban Outfitters was really unpredictable. Some days we may have a tremendous amount of work and others none at all. I learned how to deal with different management styles and attitudes in different environments, mainly how to motivate others and keep a positive morale. My co-workers were great. They were supportive, encouraging and hardworking individuals. The hardest part of the job was seeing so many people leave as quickly as they did. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we met  our goals."
good,"Good staff, easy to get along with"
good,Its like working in a high school. you have to be best friends with someone or work like a slave in order to get anywhere and even then you don't feel like it was worth it.
good,"-Awarded the “Star Employee” "
good,"As a dpt manager you are expect to play many roles in the  store. One major thing is ensuring your department is comping, making directives for the week having business walkthrough, hiring and training for your department, payroll, scheduling, and many more. The hardest part sometimes is meeting the very high and somewhat unobtainable expectation the higher ups have each week. The over all atmosphere was pleasant, but can quickly change if there is one bad egg in the group."
good,this job was an ok job. it provided me with work to  support my family and obtain the necessaties needed to function  comfortably in life.
good,Co-workers were pretty nice. I've learned more about customer service. It was an upbeat place to work. The management was good at communicating with the employees.
good,"These people care nothing about you, your schedule, household or family life. They will work you until 12am without considering your kids or whatever. This place is modern day slavery."
good,"A typical day at urban required a keen sense of business. This was a requirement due to the amount of product that was sold in the store. Each department had to be monitored through sales and inventory reporting to ensure maximum profitability for your department. This was a skill that i have learned from previous employers,however Urban Outfitters really taught me how to focus that skill. "
good,"Dit was de meeste creatieve winkel waar ik heb mogen werken. Ik heb de opbouw van de winkel mogen meemaken en ook internationale kunst artiesten mogen ontmoeten. Super leuke collega's gehad, waarvan de meeste ook in de creatieve wereld zitten. Mijn typische werkdag was dat ik er altijd best vroeg moest zijn. Helaas werd er niet altijd rekening gehouden met mijn schoolrooster. Waardoor ik soms zowel op school als op het werk moest zijn. Hier heb ik helaas ook niet veel geleerd in mijn vakgebied, wel heb ik geleerd hoe het eigenlijk te werk gaat in een kledingwinkel."
good,"A typical day of work was normal."
good,"great schedule, wonderful place to learn about the basics of visual merchandising and customer service.  awesome products and employee engagement."
good,"A lot of competition and some under qualified superiors."
good,"From what I can say working at this company has its good points and its bad points. I have enjoyed working with some really great people and not so great but it does make the job easier. I would have to say management also has its ups and downs. Sometimes I see why a manager is a manager and other times I wonder how in the world this person maintains this position. I love the fact that I can explore many different creative styles when it comes to clothing. I've learned that sometimes hard work pays at this job but not all the time, it's all timing. As far as advancement some people move up pretty fast on the ladder, others seem to get lost in the mix and end up becoming a missed opportunity."
good,I only worked here for holiday one year. it was an alright place to work. full time staff was friendly.
good,"Working with the concept design team was extremely demanding, with many concrete deadlines needing to be met. However, working under such pressure allowed for a lot of learning and growing as a designer, and ultimately it was a very worthwhile experience. I expanded my Photoshop skills exponentially, and got a very real view of the fashion world from a retail perspective."
good,During the day floor associates spend most of their time maintaining the stores overall appearance. The most valuable skill I acquired during my time here was customer service experience. A lot of cashiering is required as well. The most enjoyable part of the job was the 40% discount on all clothing. By far the best discount I've seen in a retail company.
good,"Fun place to work, laid back, cool environment. Typical retail job, great co-workers!"
good,great people and environment to work in. learned to work with people and help customers.
good,"A typical day at work involves trading the business by analysing sales figures, best/worst sellers, managing deliveries and constantly communicating with suppliers discussing business building tactics to maximise sales/sell through. Sourcing the best most suitable product for the customer and negotiating the best possible terms to increase profit margin."
good,"fun and fast driven environment to work in"
good,"Great work enviroment.,Great pay , nice benifts , cool co workers"
good,Easy going - mostly involves folding/running clothes onto the floor. Little push for customer involvement. Fun management and employees.
good,"Very busy store,helping customers find what they like and some time we may not have it but we made the best out of it."
good,"I've learned allot about different software. I've learned how to work as a team and get the job done. I loved my Co-workers. I didn't like the management so much. We kept getting new people and didn't take the time to learn jobs, they had no idea what i was responsible for. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with my work on tip of all my reports. I liked the people I worked with."
good,"Ok, good first job and good work experience"
good,Urban is a very creative company and the people are a great time. You learn a lot about running a business. The upper management can be a bit idealistic at times. But overall I learned a lot and still do appreciate my time at Urban.
good,"I have enjoyed working for Urban Outfitters. Its a great company that has had a tremendous amount of growth thus far and has much growth potential. I've worked there for a few years and I have been promoted three time. However the jobs that are currently available do not enable me to mazimize my individual potential given my skill set.Its a great place to start, but now I'm just looking for more..."
good,"The hours are great if you're in management or in a lead position. It's a fairly relaxed working environment. Honestly, It feels as though the higher ups in the company don't truly care very much for the employee's within the store locations."
good,"I've learned a great deal from the company, and my personal experience with the company was very rewarding."
good,"The place is set up for you not to have to leave. They have shuttle to and from your home. 6 lunch restaurants inside, plus 1 coffee/cafe open 7am, Bring your dog to work and off leash dog park, yoga outside. bicycles to ride at lunch, awesome work parties.  Unfortunately, you work so much you cannot enjoy them if you are on the design/buyind of the business."
good,"It was a great first job for me, and I was able to easily balance work and school. I was also able to work my way up in the store I was employed at, which was nice."
good,"Working, as a department manager for UO, has been quite the experience. Although, there have been many ups and downs, I am glad to have been through them all, for they have molded me into the person who I am, today. During my experience, I learned proper time management, working strong under pressure, communication, and leadership. A typical monday would consist of walking my department with the store manager. We would discuss how business went last week, what were the top sellers, what were the bottom sellers, etc. After, I would be provided my ""To-do"" list for the week. The tasks, at hand, were always very long and somewhat tedious. Tasks would consist mainly of making sure new product hit the floor, maintaining top sellers, find ways to increase profit of bottom sellers, re visualize the sales floor, train the team, uphold backstock integrity, and most of all, focus on overall business. As overwhelming as it may seem, I certainly got a kick out of it. Strategizing and executing a plan in order to do the impossible was always a driving force, for me. There was no better satisfaction than fulfilling weekly goals with help from a strong team. The only aspect of this job that I did not favor were the hours. Having a very sporadic schedule has made things difficult for sustaining a fun personal life. It's a miracle I ever graduated from college, all while working full time. We make many sacrifices, working in retail, and I just want to be able to do more with my life.   The most enjoyable part of this job was the people. I stayed for so many years because I had the opportunity"
good,"Always a wonderful staff even when the expectations or job were difficult or less than fun. Often told to work more time than was available, or work overtime without the mandated break, but I worked at a busy location and the work wasn't very hard."
good,"Typical retail job, I liked my coworkers in the two different stores I worked in, but there was not enough career advancement even though I was qualified and the pay was low"
good,it is fun working in an environment that encourages personality (hence free dress code) but it is frustrating because we received schedules hours before the week/day started
good,"A fun place to work, with great people. Super amazing staff, would love for everyone to experience such an amazing work experience. Amazing management as well."
good,"Urban Outfitters is unique in it's culture. In past years, the focus has always been more heavily placed on visual presentation and overall aesthetic of the space. Our customers traditionally are drawn to the displays and cultural connection to the product. Over the course of the most current year, an emphasis has been more heavily placed on customer service and the customer experience."
good,"very down to earth store, alot of individualism. people can be themselves and be free in the way they dressed. have to make sure you stay up to date with trends"
good,"I loved this job, great coworkers, decent benefits, fun environment, decent benefits. You can't really live off of the salary, though. definitely better suited for someone college-aged that doesnt need to support themselves. you also wont advance unless you are favored."
good,Fast paced with fun coworkers.  Shifts were varied back when I worked there.  A closing shift would start at 3pm and could last until 2am at times.  It was a cut throat work environment.
good,"A place where a lot is expected, but there isn't much to look forward to after all of your hard work. There are also little to no chances of advancement within the company, mostly lateral ""promotions"" with less than $1 raises. You meet a lot of cool people though."
good,"In a high-volume store there is always something to do/ something that needs to get done which is great because you're always busy. The best thing about the job (besides building a great wardrobe) is the people you meet. You can meet some really great people and learn a lot from each other along the way. "
good,Retail has the same pros and cons. The people I worked with were fun and helpful. Customer service is an exercise in restraint and compassion. If you love to engage with different types of people go for it.
good,"I spent a lot of time on my feet. I organised the store, and I worked to fulfil the needs of customers. The people I worked with were lively and diverse. Overall, the job was fairly boring but a good experience."
good,"As a department manager a typical day of work consists of the following: providing a level of customer service that inspires your team., overseeing daily procedures, managing associates, and making business related choices in you department."
good,"As a team leader, I know that working closely with other leadership members it can get very stressful. You do learn alot about retail but at the expense of you sanity."
good,Fast paced work heavy lifting. Work days are from 7:00AM to 3:30PM. Holidays off and paid. A 25 minuet break and half hour lunch. Pay is low and advancement is hard to achieve.
good,"Customer service. Promoting sales. Cleaning and maintaining the store. Cashier duties. This is a place to work if you are into trending fashions.  There are many negatives to working here. Though you may enjoy the atmosphere and family like relationships with many of your coworkers, it is not a place I would suggest building a career. Corporate micromanages and accountability is a perception not a reality within the company."
good,"If you are trying to work here and make good money this might not be the place for you. They pay management and corporate very well but sales associates poorly. It takes a while to advance in the company as well. Hours are affected by how much money the store makes and if they are ""up"" or ""down"" on sales from last year. It is really hard to make decent money to live when my hours are constantly cut. So many other retailers pay upwards of $10 an hour and I think I make $9.25.."
good,"I have worked for Urban for 5 years, Throughout that time i have developed into a senior manager with all skills needed to run a positive store turnaround and a great working team."
good,"Me gusto mucho trabajar en urban,muy buen horario."
good,worked here for only a year. learned the skills i needed to move forward with a different company. worked closely with other coworker's to improve shopping experience for all customers.
good,"Overall, the job is nice. The employees are fun and easy going. Although, I cannot say the same for management and the systems which we worked with & for."
good,"Love coworkers and the job, just can't deal with the negative attitude in the inbound department. Outbound is great though!"
good,"It was a very fast paced environment but fun job because it was something new everyday. My co-workers were great people, we all worked as a team. There really wasn't a difficult part of the job, the most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with new customers everyday."
good,Retail is not the best job but Urban can be fun. Awards ceremonies to boost employee rapport and incentive s to make sales. closing shifts were terrible.
good,"High stress job with unrealistic expectations. Great atmosphere with nice customers. I learned to work in a fast paced environment, and what it takes to run a retail company."
good,"The Job itself was a good job it was just the experience of it."
good,For the most part I enjoyed my time at Urban Outfitters. The music and clothing keep it interesting and I met some amazing people there. The biggest upside was working with like minded individuals who apprecaited hard work. The down side was the sliding schedule without set days off or even predicable shifts.
good,"Coworkers are always friendly and open to meeting new people."
good,Management Seemed To Be Overly Obsessed W/ Meeting Sales Goals That Didn't Have The Customers To Fulfill. The Store Was Disorganized At Times & Seemed To Have A Balance Set Of Managers At All. They're Obsessed With The Idea Of Being 'Hip' and Cool' So Much It Displaces The Workplace.
good,"During my time at Urban Outfitters I worked mostly as a part time retail sales associate. My tasks included: Floor sales, general cleanliness upkeep and basic clothing retail duties. During my time here I learned basic corporate management guidelines and what is required while working for a corporate retail clothing store. The management at Urban Outfitters was difficult at times. We had an overabundance of employees and roughly 4-5 managers. I was offered almost no opportunity to move up in the business. The hardest part of the job was probably the management and sporadic and never consistent schedule."
good,Anthropologie and URBN are excellent companies with strong values that encourage tenure. It's been a pleasure to be a part of such an amazing organization.
good,I feel like the particular location I work at is not very organized. I feel like there is not much room for advancement in this company. I have great co workers and I feel like this company does not discriminate at all. People are accepted for who they are. The most enjoyable part of my job is coming to a working environment where I can have fun and just be myself.
good,"urban outfitters has grown me over the last 5 years. besides it being a constant revolving door, you get to meet some of the coolest people. in addition to this, the freedom you have to be able to wear what you'd like is an extreme plus. like with any other JOB there are a few downs. but for the most part this company is pleasant to work for. self motivation is a must here. as it is easy to be overlooked with such a hugh turnover rate amongst staff"
good,The people were really good but I really disliked the limited implementation of hours and the lack of communication among employees.
good,very easy job. The management could use training in real life events that do happen even if you done have any time accumulated to be off
good,"The work was fast paced, with good management. The location was close and the people were enjoyable. The only negative was when they relocated. They pay well and I would recommend this job to people that thrive in a fast paced warehouse environment."
good,"It's a very relaxed retail environment that gives you a lot of autonomy. The starting wage isn't that great, but given the low stress level of the job itself it's reasonable for a first job."
good,"Depending which department you work for, the management is either good or bad. But the culture there is excellent. Employees can dress casual everyday, 2 company parties per year and employee appreciation days gets up to 40% off at the Urban stores. You get up to 20 vacation days if working here more than 5 years. Many peoples come and go, expect to work long hours. Overall, depending on your office politics survival skills, it’s either hit or miss."
good,"I love urban I loved my management team, I had to leave to make more money but I would go back in a heart beat if they had a bigger oppurtunity. It was good for a short term job of two years."
good,I learned so much from working with this company and have gained may life long friends. I would recommend this company to anyone looking to move up in a company.
good,"I met some of the best people in the world while working at UO. We worked ourselves to skin and bones for that company with little to show for it. The people are AWESOME, the company, not so much."
good,"UO is a great place to work that promotes a more liberal and independent work culture. Where most retail companies maintain a bit of rigidness in their work environment, UO provides more independence. Work badges are required, but ""name tags"" are not; the badge is only to identify yourself as an employee. You have the freedom to make your badge unique if you choose to do so. Absolutely no uniforms; your personal style and flair are encouraged. All full-time employees are provided with paid-time off in the form of Personal-Time, Vacation, as well as Paid-Holidays. One week of Personal-Time is the standard; that's 40hrs per fiscal year. Vacation time is based upon service time; 2 weeks upon entry, and a max-out of 4 weeks after 6 years of service. Paid holidays include: NY Day, Memorial Day; 4th of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. One thing that I've learned from working at UO is that no day is typical. We have daily tasks that need to be completed. You can spend 8 hours the previous day planning out the next, but all it takes is for one person to call-out and the wrench is soon thrown into the gears. I've also come to believe that there are two types of managers that exist: those that plan for the future, and those that choose to plan day-to-day. Proactive versus reactive. Holiday season would have to be the toughest part. Whatever problems or kinks you encounter from Jan-Oct are magnified 10x from Nov-Dec. The best part of the job would have to be the independence and creativity promoted throughout the company. The people that you work with and under will also help"
good,"My experience at Urban Outfitters was pretty positive. It was a lot of fun, and became friends with many of the people I worked with there. The job itself was challenging and never boring."
good,worked fit and register. tasks were simple but work could be redundant and drab at times. the overall aesthetic is pleasant and dressing for work is integrative and fun.
good,"While I enjoyed working for Urban Outfitters and got along with my coworkers, there were not many opportunities for someone to grow within the company. Spots to move up were very limited and even if you did, your pay wasn't much better than what you started with. The only good thing about Urban were the people and the 40% off discount."
good,"I found such a job worked will during my time of studying. As the hours and rota were both flexible and decent. A job like such allowed me to gain a little extra income and never required high amounts of stress levels, even though it was a fast place environment."
good,"Arriving in the early AM, receiving and merchandising product while designing the environment to be cohesive. Directing others and delivering tasks to be done. Management was consistently challenging while also kind. Hardest part of the job was working long and hard hours with payment not being reciprocal. Most enjoyable was being able to use my natural talents of creativity and being hard-working."
good,I really liked urban outfitters they paid good the managers wasn't nasty we had weekends off overall it was a good job I wish they didn't move to Philadelphia
good,Urban outfitters is a fun and easy place to work in. The discount is pretty good and they offer other discounts through out the years for employees. The people are chill but the managements needs work.
good,"Fun place to buy one of a kind clothes and accessories, helpful and friendly staff, great place for gift ideas, not particularly catering to any age group."
good,"The employee benefits are great. They have a 401-k plan, offer health insurance and benefits to full-time employees, and offer 40% off discount with select 60% off items. The pay isn't the best but there are pay increases once a year as well as Christmas bonuses for all employees. There is a lot of favoritism in this company and the only way to get promoted (even if you're an amazing worker) is through kissing up to management. This job is perfect for a temporary job for college students and the like. It's easy to climb up the ladder but this job with change you and you will eventually get tired of the ""hipster"" mentality."
good,"Horrible hours, great management and fun place to work at! High theft rate which makes it heard for them to supply hours. Great employee discount and cool managers who are flexible and understanding."
good,I loved the culture and the vibe that Urban Outfitters provided but the benefits were lackluster. Compensation was well below market and there was virtually no vacation time offered in your first year.
good,"•	Team lead in training in training, merchandising, sales, scheduling, register, customer service, restocking, and store meetings."
good,"A typical day at the Urban Outfitters home office for me involved a lot of detailed work, whether it was taking measurements, organizing mail or working with microsoft office. I learned a lot in this position, not only about techinical design and Urban Outfiters as a company, but also about myself and how to be the most detail oriented and efficient worker that I can be."
good,I contracted here for 3 months and was blindsided by a contract termination. I was never trained. There was no real communication.
good,"Urban is a great company to grow and build your retail resume.  A typical day starts long before customer shopping hours, and can end well after.  Employees are expected to get their ""hands dirty"" with a multitude of tasks - from receiving shipment (carrying heavy loads), processing shipment, cleaning, and much more. The customers can be demanding, but great service always helps.  There are several opportunities and positions to advance within the company."
good,A typical work day was being stationed in a certain area and maintaing that area. I was able to take on more responsibility the longer I was there. I helped with merchandising and leading other associates.
good,"Typical day consisted of managing my staff and rotas in my department."
good,"I did enjoy the people I worked with, I learned a lot about the different types of patrons that came in the store. The atmosphere among the employees was very delightful."
good,"It's a real laid back place to work. You basically wear whatever you want, just don't come in naked. There is always something to do, whether it's runs or customer service or keeping things neat. Co- workers are great. Management is ok. of course you have the manager that everyone likes, and you have the manager that no one likes. just like at any place, so things can get a bit petty. Hardest part of the job is closing, but only if it is a perfect close, or u have the manager that always wants to do a perfect close even if it's xmas season and things get trashed. most enjoyable part is just working with co-workers and the 40% discount"
good,"I really like this job I can listen to awesome music, choose my own attire for work (unrestricted), and it is very laid back while at the same time still work. The hardest part of the job is keeping everything in the store organized since it is high volume. A typical day consists of assisting customers, maintaining appearance in the store, loss prevention, operating the cash register, and answering phone calls. The management is always available and ready to help if we need them, but information can always be found by asking a coworker. I have learned new ways in which to service customers and am improving on my skills."
good,"I didn't work there long, but their management and leads are fantastic, they treat their employees with the utmost respect. It was a great environment to work in, and I hope I have a chance to work for them again next Fall/Winter."
good,"I've been with this company for at least 3 years. My ultimate goal is to work in the headquarters but that takes a little time. It also depends on who you know. I don't mind my managerial staff. I get along with them pretty well. Some people say advancement takes a while and it is true. There are not a lot of open positions available and everyone is always trying to apply for the same one. The worst part is the hours, depending on how well the store is doing you may get a lot of hours. That's retail for you though. I do love that I can explore my own style within the store."
good,"The team is great, and management is good. They work you hard though, and expect to not have much of a life if you are full-time. Job first, life way second."
good,Fun & laid-back with amazing coworkers to work with. Fun to toy with different garments & dress mannequins. Also great for the trendy younger crowd. Enjoyed working with most everyone & collaborating on different outfits. Would suggest working here if you’re big into fashion & younger.  If you’re already in your mid 20s I wouldn’t find the job ideal. Not a sustainable income more of a hobby to work here.
good,One of the main reasons why I left Urban Outfitters was because I had to return back to East Lansing for school and I didn't have a strong enough desire to stay. I got offered a better job at Forever 21 that paid more but management there was also poor and lacked communication so I decided to quit.
good,"I felt like there was no training at all. At the time, I was newer to sales and felt like a fish out of water. After a week or two I was rezoned to only work in the fitting room and felt excluded from the team."
good,"Don't expect tenured employees to be friendly to those that come from other companies. That rude, cool kid vibe they are known for still runs strong. But you can enjoy being able to dress however you want for work."
good,"Working at UrbanOutfitters was great. The store, employees were amazing to work with. A typical day would include being stationed at one of many departments in the store and switch out with other employees every two hours. Sometimes if you were given a register shift that is all you would do for the rest of the day. Management was good, they never really breathed down your neck and watched every single thing that you did."
good,"There's nothing to working for Urban, its like any other retail job. Maybe the pay could be a bit better, but its a good introduction to the retail field."
good,"The culture is the primary allure to the UO brand.  Great opportunities for creative growth no matter what your position or tenure was.  Specifically for the SBL position, there tended to be minimal payoff financially but the cultural amenities far than made up for it."
good,Urban Outfitters provided me with opportunities to enhance my customer service skills and creativity. The management staff encouraged me to be creative with displays and engage with customers and colleagues on a new level which motivated me to go above and beyond and allow me to advance to the position I am in today.
good,"My day consist of receiving items that has been packed, labeled and ready to ship out to our best customers. It was a very laid back type of job but at the same time, we had to stay on track and make sure we met production no matter what."
good,"As an employee who has been here for more than two years, my love for working quickly dissipated in the matter of months. My who first year here, I loved every minute of it. Coworkers, management, the vibes. The whole store worked as a family and it's a family I'll always hold onto in the future. Ever since management changed, myself and everyone else felt the shift from working as a family to working for a corporate chain. Employees of all levels aren't being treated fairly, the good vibes no longer exist, and the love we all shared is gone. Employees don't know their benefits and rights because managers refuse to talk about them. Managers also don't abide by the San Francisco Labor Laws. Because working in San Francisco brings great benefits and this store brought me lifelong friends, I gave this review 3 stars. It just just sucks to leave a place that used to bring me so much joy to work for."
good,My most enjoyable part was working with great people and developing great friendships. I've learned how to multitask at a fast pace and to be well organized. I've learned how to manage a team and the store by myself.
good,Loved the creative people I worked with and really made the day go by fast and easier. Product choice was great so it made it easier to use that employee discount.
good,"Everything was cool about working there, the only problem I had was with management. They didn't communicate with each other when changes were being made & tasks (well at my location) But co workers was cool, you can really express you're style & coolest customers!"
good,rotating competitive shifts. great job for part time students and for furthering knowledge
good,"I like the company very much, but in the creative field, you do not have great job security"
good,"I liked working at Urban Outfitters, especially since I am a frequent buyer there, however management could have been better. I was often ignored and they had no problem being rude to me. However, one of the managers, Anna, was absolutely great!"
good,"Highly creative workplace, however poor internal communication and no DMM or Design Director"
good,"Great retail environment, very laid back in terms of a shopping center store. Managers and Management were very easy to get along with and talk to. Co-workers created a family like environment which made it enjoyable to come to work. For those who have worked in retail, the typical clothing/retail environment drawbacks are expected. Age demographic of the store ranged from 17-26 years, making it an enjoyable location for individuals of that age range."
good,"Urban Outfitters was a fun place to work at although very busy at times,  but all the staff working there made the job fun. I have learned that patience is the key to any job."
good,The job was very easy to learn and quick to get done. I would advance this job to a lot of people that are into packaging and mailing out material. Then going around helping others finish up their work.
good,hardest part of the job was during peak season. learn alot about retail package and regular packaging and the process of everything to get customer orders in which they order online . great job to meet new people
good,"Great supervision, the hours were just killing. The place itself is clean and very organized. The jobs were reasonably easy to complete. the breaks were also reasonable."
good,I enjoy working here because it is very diverse and I get the opportunity to not only meet new people but also have the pleasure to work with them and learn other cultures and lifestyles.
good,"Working at Urban Outfitters was relaxed and interesting most days. A typical day was spent talking with and helping customers. I learned so much in terms of customer service, time management, and working with a team. The management was not the best, but they were really great people. The overall work culture was wonderful as all of the employee's differences are celebrated and acknowledged for what job/task they would thrive at. The hardest part was probably working under pressure in busy retail seasons, but extremely manageable anyway. I enjoyed the flexibility they gave me in my work hours while attaining my degree."
good,"As far as retail goes, Urban Outfitters is a great job. The atmosphere is laid back, the job isn't incredibly difficult, it can get a bit boring but the people who work there are usually reason enough to stay."
good,"This was a great place to work. Their are multiple departments that you can be promoted to when opening are available. However, no pay increase comes with those ""promotions"" unless being promoted to supervisor. There is a high turnover rate primarily due to the point system. It is not designed to protect loyal employees are everyone is grouped together when it comes to point. A person who calls in due to a toothache will receive the same points as someone who was in a severe car accident on their way to work. Excuses are not accepted even for extreme cases. Also, each set of points take 6 months from the date received to rollover. This made coming to work stressful."
good,"Work was standard retail sails responsibilities, coworkers were easygoing and management always did their best. Other than that hours were cut, and pay isn't that great."
good,Many people love the UO brand because its casual and the fashion is quirky and youthful. The day consists of helping out customers and learning about products
good,"i love my opportunity at this job it's allowed me to grow a lot in my current field i would love to make a career out of it. The environment and employees are amazing. The job has it's good days and it's bad, but what job doesn't"
good,Good place to work for if you are really in to retail. Doesn't pay well but if you are a creative person and love getting really involved with merchandising you will fit in perfectly.
good,The job is pretty easy as an associate. Only thing is bad pay and they don't have many hours to give. Good discount though. Working as an associate you would probably need two jobs to support yourself financially. The work environment is great though.
good,"My boss encourage me to advance my computer skills and no big stress."
good,"Urban Outfitters is amazingg! I love how diverse this company is in hiring people of different races and backgrounds. Everyone there is pretty chill and managers are really sweet! Only thing I hated was the fact that I had open availability, but was scheduled for one shift a week. I had to get more hours by picking up shifts. Urban is never really busy unless its around holiday season, or there’s a big sale going on, so work is always boring and time goes by very slow because you’re just standing around. But overall, Urban is amazing culture wise. I highly suggest for college kids, as they are very open to changing availability based on your classes."
good,They were very friendly and welcoming but they didn't seem to want to give me any hours which I didn't understand because I wanted the hours. Also the managers were a little standoffish and rude.
good,"I felt this job could be amazing, although the new manager often says hurtful things to employees. I find her to the the only issue, alongside the other managers and employees who are struggling with her emotional and verbal abuse."
good,"At the beginning, Urban was a great place to work at. Nice management, nice employees,  and great location. Throughout the years, it progressively decreased."
good,I enjoyed working at UO. The other employees were great. Management could learn a thing or to how to treat others. There was no respect or any kind of decency. They push you so hard for something half the time you can't control. Packing orders you do Not have. So on and so forth. Other then that. You do what you do and its a good day.
good,"Spent my life working at URBN for peanuts, but had a lot of fun doing it. I had zero social life outside of the people I worked with but every day was a (tiring) party. Culture changed. Very stingy on the pay, but coworkers were great."
good,"I am possibly most thankful for the freedom I was granted in this space for personal development.  What I've learned most is truly the inner workings of a multi-million dollar store, especially the established dynamic between management and associates, designed to run as effectively as possible."
good,"The work itself was easy, the people were great, and the pay was very good. I just wish I could have had some better managers."
good,"My department manager to be very direct and helpful in stating "
good,"Almost impossible to get a promotion, you have to have nothing else going on in your life and brown nose."
good,"Showing up early am hours normally, sometimes worked afternoon shifts. Once established as a regular was put on desired shift hours for the most part. Flexible job where maintaining the floor and keeping the brands image were important. Developed people skills by recommending things to customers and talking with them. Co-workers were alright for the most part. Loved some people, disliked others but got along with everyone for the most part. Hardest part of the job was maintaining consistency and keeping up with the clothing that was constantly being messed up by customers as they shopped. Enjoyed getting off early and being the one person in the store who did what I did better than anyone else, even though it was a basic function. Made me feel important."
good,Overall a typical day at work will be clocking in going to your destinations of what floor you are placed in and every hour you change placement making it less boring for the employee.
good,"Was a great place to work but the management would never let you progress throughout the job, so there was no goals."
good,I worked at Urban Outfitters for a summer job in college. Manager would often call you in when you were not working and often micro managed. She always had a dismissive off look on her face and was not very inviting.
good,My favorite part about working at Urban are my coworkers. I always enjoy working with them because we make a good team and there is good communication. I've learned a lot about dealing with other people at Urban who have different personalities than me and also have learned a lot about myself and the accomplishments that I am able to achieve. The culture of Urban is very easy-going but at the same time fast-paced because we do get busy very often.
good,"I've learned that the customer always comes first. I also learned how to work in teams and use open communication. "
good,Helps develop social skills. Also great because you are able to meet new people everyday. The staff was very helpful and informative.. They welcomed newcomers with a smile.
good,"Accept shipment from receiving dock, inspect garments for carelabels and fabric content, get measurement and volume via scaning and set proper shipping requirements (i.e. valuable, fragile and/or hazardous)"
good,"I was well on my way into management and leadership role(s) at Urban Outfitters. After 400 Work-Hours as a Temporary Employee, I was supposed to be promoted to a ""Direct Employee"". However, this never happened and excuses were constantly being made as to why. "
good,"It was a temp job. I was asked to come in and take inventory and gen. labor. I liked working there, the people were easy to work with and I learned how to work a cycle counter gun and a lift picker. I hate to see it close down."
good,I have learned a lot about working in retail and have worked closely with the Visual and Display team which I thoroughly enjoy. There us a lot of opportunity to grow within the company and a good place to gain experience.
good,"It was an okay experience. Management wasn’t the best for a awhile, and it wasn’t until I was in the process of leaving that things started to get better."
good,This business closed it's office in our city since I was working there. It was a fast placed work environment. They had some good employee benefits such as discounts.
good,I liked my time working here.  They provided me with great hour of and pay in the beginning of my time working.  Things changed when hour of work was harder to get and put me on-call.
good,"Working at Urban varies between slow and fast-paced. During holiday season, it gets busy but is still fun. During slow season, I don't get a lot of hours which I don't like, but that's why I have another job- so I can continue working there while still paying the bills. I really like the discount benefits of working there, including employee appreciation period, one of the main reasons I'm still working there. I've talked to managers about moving up in the company, like as a manager for a department, but it's never gone anywhere, so I don't think this is a good job for moving-up opportunities unless you plan on working there for several years."
good,"Being an employee for this company was a fun experience as it allows its workers to be expressive. Although the environment is fun, I do not feel that the management and job duties are functional."
good,"i learned so much during the 5 years i was employed here, but it wasn't fulfilling so i changed my career course. conveniently, interior design and fashion go hand and hand so it was an easy transition."
good,"Cool coworkers, managers weren't always as sensible but some were. Customers were sometimes difficult but managable. best part of working there were the coworkers."
good,"Seeing as how this was my first job moving into NYC, it was a great experience for me. Not so much in terms of pay/hours, but rather we were often given the freedom to dress in a way that is expressive to us as individuals, in addition to being surrounded by fun and enthusiastic co-workers."
good,"I enjoy working here, other than not knowing what time you'll be off that day. Also you have little to no advancement in the company and they do not pay enough."
good,this job is good if you desire to work in retail for the rest of your life. the opportunity for promotion is slow. its kind of boring. but its a job. .
good,"Great place, just not to work.new store, stank attitudes. snails pace advancement. The city might have something to do with that. eVERYONES UNDER TOO MUCH PRESSURE."
good,"A typical day in the life of a UO employee would be as follows. Clock in, check clipboard or floor supervisor for your placement in store,and began to assist customers,talk with other employees or just straighten up area while listening to music. Management for the most part was unseen unheard until there was something needed of them. The hardest part of the job was no stability. The most enjoyable part was meeting customers and making some good friends with employees."
good,"Great place to work at. High volume, friendly environment. Great music, great employee discount. Also one of a kind store events."
good,"i enjoyed working with urban outfitters becasue evryone was friendly, verry cooprative and helful if it was needed, money wasnt bad and it wasnt too far from where i lived"
good,"The very best part of  my job is educating follow employees with the best tactics for offering resolutions to our customers needs. I really enjoy working with my co-workers, my immediate is amazing and call center manager is very approachable as well accommodating."
good,"Alright place to work, wish I would've landed this job at 18, the pay is low. 11 and hr when Urban makes 4 million dollars a quarter...hmm?Employee discount is the truth, but other than that, meager wages mixed with slow weeks where you are ""voluntary timed offed"" VTO'd. Basically when they don't want to pay you for 40 hours, they send your behind home and call it the ""retail"" way. Love the clothes, love the store. hate the pay."
good,"This job environment was a very relaxed one...the managers were cool, but the employees were subject to favoritism and a certain type of style was required..."
good,Staff is very friendly and likeable
good,"I worked at the new warehouse in Reno, NV. and really like going to work everyday and although I worked for a temp.services I was not treated like it. The management seam to be working threw growing pains with new equip. problems I can see them only getting better."
good,Overtime when not needed was a big issue. The management was not  very approachable and had favoritism to a lot of employees that would kinda be a suck up
good,Around the holidays there's not much work and they send you home/ ask if you want to go home. Move people around a lot. Favoritism. Not trained in the area your working in specially when you get moved around.
good,Always enjoyed working at Urban Outfitters.Great experience at Urban. Very close to my house.Enjoyed the nice people and supervisors  that were there.
good,"When it came to scheduling, it was different every week. Which is only bothersome when you have to work in the evening one day, and then the morning the next."
good,The job is easy but very fast paced. If you looking for something that involves you moving all the time and great pay this is the job for you and depending on your location it may be a little bit of a drive to get to the area.
good,"great team incentives and great  team work all around, amazing discount and amazing customers. Loved working at this store. The product and people were great."
good,"It is flexible when it comes to work schedules, but I would not recommend outside of that. The pay does not match the level of work you have to put in."
good,It’s easy work for the most part. You just need transportation and time to have for overtime. The pay isn’t all that good for starters however if you and help with the bills you’ll be ok.
good,"Typical sales associate job. A lot of tasking. Very easy-going, and laid-back work environment. Not a lot of opportunity for growth within store unless someone else leaves."
good,The work-life balance is adequate. Management for the most part is attentive. The hardest part of the job was dealing with clients. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team dynamic.
good,"Was able to learn a lot about processing sales, customer service, and administrative work. In charge of opening and closing procedures, as well as cash handling."
good,"There is a lot of turnover but this is great as a student job. It is simple work, you get a great discount, and there is an awesome community of workers with only some drama."
good,"Working at Urban is perfect if you're young and don't want to be held down by a dress code. They hire all sorts of people and it's really liberating how they promote each employee to be themselves. The work is really physically demanding, but if you show you work hard they'll be eager to promote you."
good,Urban Outfitters is one of the best place to work in this country. It provided a challenging working environment along with an urban culture. The highlight would be the urban culture which is wholly accepted and encouraged through out the company.
good,"Urban Outfitters, while a corporate company, ensures that all individuals voices are heard and that each store has its own identity among its others stores, and caters to specific clientele demographic."
good,"UO is a great company to build experience at, especially because of how well known it is. Have to be patient and determined to grow within the company it can take years if you’re not a managers favorite."
good,i enjoyed working here at a time when i was young and not too worried about finance or advancement.It's an ok place to work flexible hours but alot of employees.
good,Urbn Inc. was a great place to work but be prepared to work weekends (Sat AND Sun) 10 hours 7 days a week. They will work if theres work to be done and there will never be a lack of work.
good,Great place to enter a field. Allows for advancement and on the job training. Most upper level management positions seem to be filled by people who were promoted from within.
good,A great place to work part time. Opportunity to grow as an employee. Not much job security as a part time sales associate. Fair pay wage. Flexible schedule.
good,Its a job love it but just temporary.. I would hate to leave but can't stay and next day I no longer have a job.. Me still being with them knowing it was seasonal tells u I work hard.
good,"A relaxed and fun place to work. Management is always changing but generally, the same type of person is hired. Laid back but strict at times so just get our work done and don't mess around"
good,Great to learn about shipping and receiving as far as the process goes. Learned a lot about power machine and different lifts. Good people to work with.
good,"the hardest part of this job is web verifying the units and emailing the buyers to let them know what's wrong. "
good,"Perhaps it was because I worked there during a very busy time of the year but the management was just all over the place, didn't seem to have any idea what they were doing. When I sense a lack of confidence in the management at a job it makes me lose value in the workplace. But I ultimately quit for reasons unrelated, and I overall enjoyed working for UO. Being real.. I was just too depressed to deal with it at the time. This was about 3 years ago."
good,Working at urban was great. There was a lot of friendly co workers who i shared many interests with. At the time work conflicted with my schedule so I had to leave.
good,"This job is a really fun job. It gave you a chance to be creative and come with your own style. The team members were all unique and interesting people. Which made it have an awesome vibe. "
good,"Great employees, fun workplace, easy starting job; unfortunately, didn't pay enough for amount of work put in; learned how to customer service and talk and connect to customers"
good,Easiest job I have ever held. Rewarding customer and coworker relationships. Great discounts on normally very expensive shopping. Opportunities to work on special projects and move up in the ranks.
good,"It was my first job, so I definitely gained a lot of knowledge, which I would later come to apply in my following jobs. Definitely a great first time experienced. Loved the rotating shifts, I just feel it made the work environment easier and simply helped everything flow. The best part about working at Urban outfitters was the social interaction with the guests. I loved meeting and helping out people, for a daily outfit, or a special event, date night maybe type outfit. It was the best!"
good,I worked at urban for five years and made some of my best friends there. I learned a lot about fashion and grew a lot while being there. It was an amazing company to work for.
good,"I become friends with most everyone who I work with, and I love the environment.  They really appreciate who you are as a person outside of the store, and are very flexible with availabilities and scheduling."
good,Standard retail environment where you work with various customers and employees. Appreciate the fact that you are allowed to express yourself freely based on personal style.
good,The opportunity to collaborate with so many different departments is what made the experience unique and creatively inspiring.
good,Working at Urban Outfitters gives you the opportunity to develop personal accountability and a strong work ethic. You have the freedom of creative expression which allows you the comfortability to be yourself and grow within a company you share and uphold  the same values and approach to business with.
good,"Definitely not a career. No advancement at all. No room for error. Great transitional job for students. Very robotic. Customers are abusive over all job stressful. Pay is nice hours are ideal if earned. Hour lunch, two 15 minute breaks. Benefits are great. The customers are the absolute worst part of the job."
good,"Very in-tune with the urban culture. Eclectic, trendy, and unorthodox. I worked at 3 different locations and enjoyed a majority of my coworkers, but please do not work here if you do not understand the urban culture."
good,managers were showing a lot of  favoritism to the employs they like and giving more hours to them. i always always quite working there I was a lonely they didn't have any problem with me but i saw how others got treat unfairly.
good,"Everyday at Urban Outfitters is somewhat hectic. The work environment is okay. Management was okay until recent changes in management and staff. It hard to determine how serious some of the management and employees were about there jobs and it was always unclear what tasks were needed to be prioritized. The hardest part of the job, for me, was pleasing the customer and management simultaneously. while the customer always goes first, they are also very serious about getting certain tasks done doing the work day which doesn't quite stay in line with satisfying the customer. I have learned to independently acquire information and use my sharp knowledge to complete a task with accuracy."
good,"Urban Outfitters is a great place to work if you are looking to advance into management roles. If you don't want to work in a conventional retail store and are a creative individual, then Urban Outfitters would be a great fit."
good,"Fast paced work place with passionate customers - employers were determined and trained me well. "
good,"After working for Urban Outfitters for over 2 years, I've learned a lot about customer service. After each day of work I learn something new whether it has to do with cash wrap, back office, or business reports. Management always likes to see you being productive and not just standing around. I love the vibe that it gives off and how friendly my co workers are. The only hard part about working here would be closing. Because we have such a big store, closing can be a bit rough and sometimes we wouldn't leave until midnight or later. However besides that, I do enjoy working there and would recommend it to anyone who wants to go into retail."
good,"Although this is not my first gig at retail job, dealing with new incoming management where everyone is off cue can be difficult. However, I did enjoy my time at this job and highly recommend it to those who are just going through school and don't have to worry much about paying bills."
good,it was ok. They were flexible with your hours. Management was understanding. Coworkers were nice and cool. Got along with everyone
good,"Plenty of walking in the huge building"
good,"I like working here because it was easy to move up in the company, they wanted people to move up. Everyone was allowed to be themselves and have their own style."
good,"The people working at UO made the company fun, however we were often over worked and so tired and not having as much fun as we could have. we would often work late or early even though the opening hours were already 12 hours every day so we would often be pushed very hard to meet targets. The creativity within the store was great."
good,"can get fast paced, but its the usual retail story. Flexible scheduling if part time. Employee discount is nice if you like shopping."
good,Fun place to work. The people are definitely what makes it amazing! Lots of communication from district and regional managers and home office. Visual merchandising pushes you to think outside the box.
good,"My experience at Urban Outfitters was mostly pleasant. I enjoyed learning the management skills that I gained, as well as being able to work in such an interesting and hip store. Some days were more stressful than others, but I had a great time while working there."
good,"Urban is a great company to work for.  The store team is like a family.  We are able to successfully run a business and still have fun.  I was able to develop my communication, interpersonal, organizational, and time management skills."
good,"A day at Urban was never boring nor slow. You find yourself eager to do the next task and I believe that's simply because of the vibe they set overall of the place. Great team, great company."
good,This job has long hours and there is much to get done but the work is not very hard at all. The people are nice for the most part and the management has treated me more than fair.
good,"Throughout the day I assist with visually oriented tasks and help the sales team with new shipment and hands on training. I have learned a lot about visual standards, merchandising, and interpreting sales reports. I work in an ever-changing environment and must adapt and work quickly in order to keep up."
good,Urban Outfitters was actually a great place to work. I learned and worked my way up the ladder there in just a year. I started off picking then i got moved up to a forklift driver were i learned a lot for 3years in an industrial plant. Urban did have some of the craziest hours during Peak Season but of course it was our Peak. But when it came down to Urban getting ready to close hours really got crazy with no time off working everyday of the week for months and months but one thing i can say is that Urban is a great way to learn about the industrial environment and gets you ready for greater things in life.
good,"I ran the cash register, stocked and inventoried product, and provided customer service.  The customer base is mostly younger people around my age, so I had an easy time communicating with them and providing their every need."
good,I had a good experience with the company.  There is room for growth and development.  There are some great people that work for the company and the company culture is enjoyable.  I learned many aspects of retail warehousing and there is no typical day.
good,Working for three locations I met some fantastic people who are life long friends. It was a great experience and I was able to learn about customer service.
good,"Typical retail environment. A more hip and fun focus, but generally similar to many other retail clothing employers."
good,I love Urban Outfitters. I love the vibe and the brands and everything. I couldn't stand the gossip though in my placement. That was the onllything
good,The best part of the job is the people. Everyone works hard and has a strong sense of shared fate.
good,"The work was tedious if you were not at a management level as many retail environment jobs are. The days consisted of folding clothes, maintaining racks, greeting people as they walk in, watching the fitting rooms, and being the cashier. Fortunately, the duties that you do are changed each hour meaning one hour you're ringing people up and the next hour you're folding clothes. I found that all of my co-workers were very friendly and we had similar interests. The management got the job done and upper management visited often to assist with merchandising and further training."
good,"the campus is a great place to work at, which balances out with the long hours you might be there."
good,Fun place to work. Management is very relaxed and outgoing. Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing different styles in the same place
good,"Fast keeps you on your toes."
good,"Great company!  However, for the job that I was doing I was not compensated appropriately.  I was in charge of every penny that came through our point of sale systems.  That being said, it was a ""9 to 5"" job, however, it became an on-call seven day a week job.  I rose to the occasion, however, was a bit unhappy with the lack of direction given by my supervisors.  I could have done a lot more  IF had the time."
good,"go to managers to tell you your job dutie that day, co-workers in a college age group majority were friendly. favorite job."
good,"Usually a laid back environment, coworkers and managers very nice and friendly."
good,I don't like the way that this company is run from the top down. People low on the totem pole are bullied and have no say.
good,"•Responsible for providing excellent customer service and upholding all visual and operational standards"
good,I usually worked in the morning to process shipment. I was entitled to un-package all merchandise for my department and fill it out on to the floor using merchandizing skills or put it in the process section in the back stock and later find a home for it. I was the woman´s accessories team lead which meant i was write under the manager and had to for see  all aspects of the department. I was always on register and was entitled to have the exact amount of money the computer processed. Not a penny over or under. The people were always friendly and welcoming. I was always myself and not judged. Working at Urban Outfitters gave me a new family.
good,Typical day includes interacting with customers and fellow employees.  You will be on your feet and walk around a lot but it is easy work and enjoyable.  You learn how to interact with customers and how to enhance customer service.  The hardest part of the job can be a unhappy customer but also keeping up to date with where the merchandise has been moved to and what is new to the store.
good,"Urban Outfitters, Inc. is a great company to work for. Each store is individually designed by a strong creative team. The staff in every store I have worked in has been original, creative and eclectic. The company itself provides ample room and training to develop and grow into a career with them."
good,"Aside from Monday, everyday is generally busy at Urban Outfitters. There is always new merchandise and the staff is helpful."
good,"A typical day at work for me included; being at the stock room and helping unwrap new goods, I would be set tasks and had a period of time to try and complete it."
good,"Typical day in work was see the morning targets. Walk around shop floor. Do a floor grid of were to put new merchandise. Merchandise clothes. Create new Displays and style customers."
good,"At Urban Outfitters, we had hourly rotated roles in the store. This meant that each team member had the chance to further develop their skills in each important field of retail. We had a very close bond within our workplace and as a team, we were very driven and productive. Working Christmas time meant it was incredibly busy and was a time where I had to use my own initiative to complete set tasks and deal with any problems that arose. Having an incredibly friendly team of co-workers at Urban Outfitters made the job much more enjoyable and a very exciting atmosphere to work in. "
good,Great people to work with.  Beautiful environment and dog friendly!!!
good,"Great business. Assisting customers, carrying out projects all day. Definitely made the day go by fast. So many types of people from all over the world with that work this company. Young and talented individuals. Management was also very young, which led to no leadership skills. Very large staff. Loved wearing whatever you wanted to the job."
good,"Though there are problems with the company in general, this store can be a fun environment to work in. The managers are definitely not the worst and you can get some decent hours during a good season. Be prepared to mop!"
good,Helping clients shop and also selling products on the floor was very satisfying. After every shift we were taught the stores final sales number which would motivate me into selling more and brining in more shipments.
good,"As long as you put in the work, you have opportunitiy for advancement/promotion. Best part of the job is the people you meet. Met and worked with a variety of people and multiple locations over a 5 year span."
good,"They are very flexible, very accommodating depending on your location and manager I worked for the shoes department so it was easy to change shifts here and there"
good,"Hours can be unpredictable, like most of retail. A lot of cleaning, boring when the store is empty. The assistant managers are normally really cool and helpful, but if the store manger isn't then it makes the job much harder. The discount is awesome and its easy to learn everything."
good,Enjoyable work however only complaint is that as a student I had specific times I could not work however there was little regard for this. Colleagues were generally very nice and managers were pleasant.
good,Urban Outfitters is a company that gives youngster a great work environment. They're very flexible with hours especially with working students. They also give you the benefits to explore your artistic self and give the team new ideas to help the company grow.
good,"The store level management at Urban Outfitters has a high turnover rate, usually due to unsatisfactory work habits determined by district level management. Management however, does push its employees to always be pursuing a higher level of responsibilities within the company, and gives its employees chances to test out a promotion before deciding whether to move someone up or not. There are also many summer internships at the Home Office location in Philadelphia, for which they pay to fly its applicants out there, and allow its interns to discover more than one direction that they can go in, within the company."
good,I enjoyed working at Urban Outfitters. The scheduling was enough for a part time job but it became a little much once several team members left. If the store were managed a little better I probably would have stayed for longer.
good,Workplace culture is the most important part of the job. Even as a sales associate I felt cared for and appreciated. The management team looked for opportunities for improvement and promotion.
good,"I’ve been with the company a long time and I’m still in the same position. Management changes a lot and I feel like I would have gotten a promotion if I pushed harder with the old management but the new management doesn’t really know me and I feel like that’s why I’m in this weird limbo. Sometimes, they make you feel like you have to choose between your job and your life which isn’t fair. Overall, you meet some pretty awesome people and the clothes will keep you spending all your money lol but I have had a good experience."
good,"•Extensive  work background"
good,"I liked learning about the sales aspect of this job, also gained a lot of customer service experience, along with retail. Management was great. I loved working in a creative environment with like minded people."
good,It was am awesome experience. I enjoyed my co-workers trying to teach me their language. The managers/leads were very helpful. They provided us with coffee throughout the day because we worked 10hrs. The building was clean
good,"The days that the customers received quality customer service they always left the door feeling a little cheerier. Since my store was pretty small and in a lesser populated area, we had a lot of the same clientele all the time. Getting to really know these few customers that were regulars, made all the difference to their experience in the store and my experience with them. We made them feel like they were at home every time they were in the store and thats what kept them coming back."
good,Dealing with customers on a daily basis and being able to maintain and clean the store while catering to each customer's needs.  I learned how to ring on the register and was able to make friends at this workplace.
good,It is an Ok job to just have in the mean time. Nothing long term a quick job to have to have some money in your pocket while your in school. Not a lot of advances but if you don't plan on being there long it shouldn't matter.
good,This Urban Outfitters location in Philadelphia has a lot of great people working there which makes the days fun and it creates a great environment to work in.
good,"I walk I and a lot of positive vibes , I love all my co-workers, it was just warm welcomes from everybody. Everyday there wasalways something to do and that's what I like about the job. Checking everything and everybody.i had to be very visual on internal, external and paper work errors. The only problem is here is that there is really no room for growth. I wanted this to be my career and become something great for the company as an loss prevention investigator and grow but unfortunately it couldn't happen,"
good,"Worked retail, assist customers daily, assist store manager, responsible for maintaining inventory. responsible for opening and closing store."
good,Great place to work if you like trendy clothes and a nice discount.  Can get hectic at times and really busy. I like the design of the store and learned a lot about retail.  Very young crowd with expensive shopping habits.
good,"Typically an easy day come in look to see which area you are zoned (Front Area, Mens, Mens Sale, Runs, Womens, Womens Sale, Fitting Room) from there you attend to you responsibilities in the zone raging from maintaining and restocking floor to greating and helping guest. Real aren't any hard parts to this job, but i find working in fitting room to entertaining because of the guest. The ones sitting & waiting usually have funny stories to tell while the people trying on clothes can be very eccentric."
good,Management wasn't very good on second shift but the other employees and atmosphere make for a decent work place. Hardest part is keeping up during peak season.
good,Good place to work--except for the hours--they just do not schedule enough hours for employees--they cut hourly workers down to 1 shift per week-2 at the most---would be better with fewer employees and more shifts per employee.
good,"Urban Display is a cool work environment, perfect for recent graduate or student looking to finish school."
good,Assisted customers with their purchases and the products they need by getting whatever size of clothes or shoes from the back or front of the store. Increased sales outcome by becoming knowledgeable of store products. My supervisor would pass out our weekly sales to us to know our sales quota. Answered customer questions about store products on whether their product is in the store or order their purchases and sent to their homes. I did performed a yearly inventory check by using a scanner. I cleaned and prepared the store in an orderly and presentable manner.
good,I enjoy my time working there they never stifle your creativity at all. workday can be hectic depends on location. on-calls can be a bit of a burden. the hardest of my job is dealing with co-worker paces. the most enjoyable part of the day is customer interaction meeting people.
good,"Chaque employé est formé à la caisse, au service à la clientèle et à l'accueil du magasin. Cette rotation des postes assure un développement des compétences pertinent à l'employé chez Urban Outfitters. De plus, la rotation des postes stimule davantage le travail et permet à l'employé de connaître ses forces et faiblesses afin de s'améliorer. Ceci étant dit, l'employé évolue dans un milieu de travail sain et sécure mais est soumis à une rapidité d'exécution qui lui permet de relever des défis personnels au travail."
good,"Working as an intern at Urban Outfitters is a wonderful experience that I was lucky to have, as I was able to learn the necessary skills of the retail industry at 15, which has been an advantage amongst others as this is the career path I desire. Despite my beginning anonymity to the workings of a retail store, I was urged straight into the business, which really helped me gain independence and a hard-working, self dependent attitude."
good,"Friendly fun work environment."
good,"Worthwhile 6 months"
good,"Typical day is busy and productive maintaining positive vibes for my associates as well as the customers while presenting the best possible shopping and ""Urban"" experience, in general."
good,"Urban Outfitters is a great place to start off working.  I have learned so much about sales and superior customer service from my coworkers and managers who are all unique, passionate, and share many creative ideas."
good,Not much room for advancement.  Management was very caring and good at addressing problems.  Very friendly co-workers.  Overall atmosphere was laid back.  
good,"Normal retail job. I was able to move into a shift leader position fairly quickly which was nice because it was the same hours every week, but I never made it to the management level due to cliques. The culture of Urban Outfitters was very similar to high school, Management were the popular kids and part time employees were trying to be like them. Management never got anything done and never followed through with making sure their departments were being productive. Nor did they ensure the employees were ensuring quality customer service. "
good,"UO calls for a lot of hard work and long hours for poor compensation rates. 8+ hours for a Team Leader constantly moving and reorganizing entire shops, creating/remerchandising fixtures, multitasking between registers, fitting rooms, and customer servicing due to lack of hours for $12/hr at a high volume store seems like hard work for little pay."
good,"The company was simple, low maintenance, and low commitment job. The management was very easy going and communicated effectively. The workplace was tailored to indie hipster culture and was where you would expect young contemporary adults to shop. Customer service was straight forward and easy."
good,"A typical day at work concluded of opening and closing the store according to required tasks, organizing and cleaning the store and back stock, making sure the sales floor was always restocked, full, and looked according to the store's seasonal requirements and newest collections. I learned a lot about the industry in terms of receiving + checking packages, customer service and time management. "
good,"As long as you fold the tees and do a couple figure eights as you greet the customers, you'll speed through your shifts. Management is chill as long as you do your work and don't call out too much. Super chill place to work, pay could definitely use improvement."
good,"I learned to work more with people and different  personality better "
good,"Urban Outfitters is an excellent company and an awesome place to work! The management and co workers are some of the best people you will ever meet and many have become my good friends. If you commit to it, you can accumulate many hours, however during the slower seasons for retail hours can be difficult to come by depending on your standing and department. The compensation was not the best however there was a holiday bonus provided to each employee (awesome) and opportunities for additional hours if you put forth the time and investment into the store. One thing no other retail store can touch is the diverse and rich culture of Urban Outfitters. Any and all people are accepted here and because of this, the cohesion between the entire team was fun and eye opening."
good,A non-typical merchandising role where I am rarely at a desk.  I merchandise rooms in a real life set up in a large converted ship yard building for anthropologie home catalog.
good,"Workplace culture was nice. Group reflections at open and close times to increase morale and sense of community. Disorganized scheduling that was at times unclear. I only worked as a seasonal sales associate for a short time, and can't really speak to job security or benefits."
good,A typical day at work is routine. You vary stations every hour but are predominately in one more than another. I learned how to sell certain products to customers who maybe intended to buy something else. Management is overall good. They are attentive and helping. The workplace culture is relaxed. All employees are friendly and encouraging. The hardest part of the job  is loss prevention. We ourselves have to locate shop lifters and check bags when alarm goes off. The most enjoyable part of the job is to sell products that provoke conversation and are creatively unique.
good,"Meet great diverse people of many different backgrounds (employees and customers). Hours can be  excruciating, especially for parents, sometimes released at  4 a.m. for ""perfect closing"""
good,"The management staff was a great set of people, very laid back and easy going but also assertive. Long hours on your feet and short breaks. Compensation doesn't really equate to the amount of work you're putting in."
good,"came in and inspected the store for anything out of sorts. when store opened i made sure staff and customers would doing the right thing. I loved the people i worked with, especially the management. they were always welcomed of new ideas and very sincere."
good,over all I like to work in the warehouse envirement .I really loved working with my coworkers ..the best part about this job is we received many discounts
good,"Hipster vibe, nice playlist of music. I learned how to be a leader and encourage my coworkers to grow; I appreciate them looking up to me. The most difficulty I had in the environment, was angry customers, only because you're not the one in control if the situation, they are, but I never let it bother me; I got used to it. What I loved about the job was building many relationships with customers who would come back to enjoy a great shopping experience with me."
good,"Days spent maintaining store standards and helping customers find product. I learned about time management, delegation, and team building. The discount was cool too."
good,Pretty easy going place to work. Schedule has long hours but 3 day weekends typical. Management is very accommodating as long as you perform to their standards which are not difficult.
good,"Overall, working here was a positive experience. The coworkers are all young and vibrant professionals with an eye for style. The environment is relaxed for the most part and people are easy to talk to. The hardest part of the job is staying engaged. The work can get tedious at times and I feel like I'm not using my brain half of the time. The main reason why I left the business is because I needed a higher paying job."
good,I love my coworkers at Urban Outfitters and I enjoyed working on register. The environment is fast-paced and always kept me on my toes.
good,"Great job for lazy people, not really hard just a lot of folding and standing around. A couple of the STAFF/MANAGERS suck. But pretty laidback and fun."
good,Worked at Urban for 2 years. Pretty much loved it but when I was forced to move to another mismanaged store everything went down hill. They work you very hard and pay you barley nothing and expect you to be grateful. The awesome discount and great co-workers are the only saving grace.
good,"I was originally hired to interpret the American e-mail forms that were sent to German customers and basically had to translate and recreate them all, but then a contract fell through in Germany and we became obsolete so I then had to work as a customer service representative on the phone and talk to people about their orders, problems, and other issues that came up. I learned how to use sterling which is the operating system for the call center and learned great customer service skills. My management was a great team and they always kept it fun and interesting while we were working. my co -workers were all really nice but it was very busy so you couldn't really get to know them well. The hardest part was dealing with irate customers that wouldn't even tell you what the actual problem was and just use foul language while yelling at the top of their lungs. Most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers pick out clothing or furniture for important events and them being so excited about what we came up with together."
good,"packing and shipping singles or multiples items using WMS process, ups system and Labeling all the boxes "
good,"A typical work day for any employee at the UO DC in Trenton is to receive or put away product, pick, pack, or ship orders to customers. The employee comes in knowing what is expected of them each day. Most of the time it does not change. "
good,"A very heavily assorted store in which you must stay n your game, as far as shipment, daily product moves as per sales ect. I learned how to stylize in te way urban outfitters does, and that is irony.  Pairing a frilly chiffon dress with beat up combat boots for example.  It was a very different approach on fashion.  The most enjoyable part of the job was its diverse people and culture.  Fresh ideas and different ways of looking at fashion and merchandizing as a whole."
good,Working at Urban in the design department allows you to be creative and have fun with you work.  It is very fast paced but ends up being rewarding because you are actually able to see the results of your work.  Not like a traditional firm/studio at all.
good,"A typical day at work begins at 6am where shipment of apparel is received and we place product by merchandizing according to corporate trend guidelines that are given to myself and the visual team. Weekly, we go over business trends and evaluate them ased on product moves and placement specific to our store's customer profile. I make sure product is filled, merchandised correctly and that it reflects the company's brand integrity."
good,"I learned various things working at Urban Outfitters. A typical day at work included anything from ringing non stop from the beginning of the shift till the ending to processing and finding the skus for various items. The hardest part of my job is that there's not really a set guideline of rules and procedures, it seems like everyone has a different way of doing something and as a new hire it was extremely confusing. The most enjoyable part of the job is the great employee discount for myself and my friends and family as well as employee appreciation season perks."
good,"Typical days included enhanced customer service and running around trying to help everyone get through the day as smoothly as possible. Leaned how to delegate work to coworkers and lead my fellow associates to a productive day. Management was OK, some were very good, others were very unprofessional. Great interactions and relationships with all of my coworkers. I would say the hardest part about the job was rationalizing management decisions that hindered the success of the store. The most enjoyable part would absolutely be the relationships i built with my fellow co workers."
good,"Knowing nothing about the retail industry, I was thrust into a world of both fashion and finance.  I tried to soak up everything that I could (and I did) and excelled in my communications techniques within the company."
good,"The days are either one of 2 ways, extremely busy or extremely slow. Either way, there's always fun to be had.  The managers are nice, the coworkers are pretty cool as well. The worst part of the day is having to refold and rehang everything once the day is done. The job overall is nice relaxed part time job"
good,"A typical day consists of processing shipment in the morning once I arrive at work, 10am. Then place samples (new items) we receive in the appropriate room environments in the mens department. Once completed we will work on mark downs or change out displays in the men's department."
good,"Relaxed work day, great coworkers (mostly college students). Management was ok for the most part. Scheduling wasn't too great for me. "
good,Urban Outfitters was a great environment to work in. Day to day we worked with reports to help understand our most performing product to our least. We would then make changes to the floor set to help increase sales and attention of bottom selling items. We had a fun environment where we could all work together and create our own space based off of corporate inspiration. The hardest part of the position was to maintaining a work/life balance. There was so many people to manage and a heavy work load creating the in store experience that work would exceed a 50 hour work week.
good,i was blessed to have chosen to work for a store with such wonderful employees and that really makes or breaks your workplace experience in my opinion.
good,"Urban is a great company to work for if you're a creative looking to be around people with similar interests and network with local people. The work is not too difficult but sometimes customers and management can be demanding. At the management level, forget about work-life balance period. You'll always be around good people and listening to good music at work though."
good,"Easy college part-time job, with a lot of discount perks. Fun group of people. For the most part it's a relaxed, creative environment. Not much advancement."
good,"If you're going to work retail, I would recommend Urban. The clients can be frustrating, but the staff always proved to be a large, welcoming family who made it better every day."
good,I would recommend working for Urban Outfitters if you want to work with creative and fun coworkers all around. Everyone is very nice and friendly. You can grow with the company if you want too.
good,I loved interacting with customers and organizing clothes.I learned how to deal with customers in high stress situations and how to work as part of a team.
good,"Typical day:"
good,"The work is wildly varied - you will communicate with entirely disparate teams that have varying levels of experience and focus on your area. In this way, it is collaborative, fast-paced, and dynamic. It can also be frustrating, as you are relying on a lot of other teams to pull their weight so that your job can be done correctly. There is not a lot of transparency, but any kind of entrepreneurial effort is generally rewarded there. People are funny, nice, and open-minded. It's the ""coolest place in Philadelphia,"" and you literally get paid to know what's cool, so that feels nice but also is not for everyone. Fit is paramount to ability a lot of times and in a lot of positions. Focus on the customer is palpable and valid. Everything is leanly staffed, so be prepared to wear a lot of hats and work a lot of hours."
good,Urban Outfitters was my first job in retail. I was a full-time student when I began at Urban and all of my managers were very respectful of that. I loved the environment and overtime became good friends with my co-workers.
good,"Work life balance was unbalanced in PA. Regret UOI moved from Trenton SC, that facility was ran like clock work. Our Manager (in SC) was the best we ever had, caring compassionate, direct, transparent, a truly Professional Leader."
good,A caring organization and store. Its atmosphere is very flower child-like environment. The workplace itself is extremely busy on and off but is handled well. Management is kind and straightforward and does their job with efficiency.
good,I had a great few years at urban. I would have stayed longer but poor management lead to my decision to leave the company. I think longer break times and more consistent hours would have also helped my situation.
good,Worked for company for 10 years. Great people job was not complicated very engaging. Great place to advance your career. Employed there during Time of relocating
good,"great place, the management was friendly, but cut out anyone who they did not get along with.  very superficial workplace  environment, all about the latest trends and fashion"
good,while managers love bieng on their phone you will be given a write up for having yours on your person. the discount is great. it took two years to be given a chance for a promotion and it was given to an assocaite who had transferred from another store 2 weeks prior. the relationships you form with your coworkers is the best part about working for urban outfitters.
good,"UO was my very first job in retail.  Although I don't think I would stay in retail much longer, the experience was fun and the other employees were nice."
good,Up beat place where interaction is key and getting along with co workers will make working there way better and easier. Everyday it felt like there was something new to do and you didn't get bored or stressed out
good,pretty easy job for me I enjoyed it. I loved the workers and managers where the best. I just deserved more hours and a higher paying job so I had to make the decision  to part ways.
good,Good group of people to work with. We all work as an effective team which as a whole makes the store run smoothly and efficiently. Hours needed to be managed better.
good,"Overall, Urban outfitters is incredible to work for. However, I believe they are currently having a bit of an identity crisis with the change of upper management and adapting to current sales culture"
good,"everything in this job was great, considering it was just a part-time sales associate job. the only problem i had was with the manager who treated his employees badly. he blatantly insults them in the sales floor (including me)."
good,"I enjoyed my time working there. It was very relaxed and easy going. Everyone was super nice and the customers were also normally super nice. The only problem I had was that I found out after I started working that I was technically seasonal, and an assistant manager told me that I would be permanent, only to learn later that I was not. I've realized this is kind of typical in retail, however."
good,Busy atmosphere but friendly staff and great customers. Discount is big and pay is nice. Great company to work for as really care about good customer service.
good,I would typically run the fitting room and restock the sales floor. It was a pretty easy and fun job. Managers would often have favorite employees though.
good,"Who wouldn't want an employee discount from Urban Outfitters.  They have great clothes and you get to interact with people all day.  Nice place to work, down in NOB Hill too."
good,"I work at the surplus store in Sherman oaks. Most urban's are really busy but this one is almost always empty and it can get boring. Theres really nothing to do most of the time. Make friends with your coworkers, they're always really cool people. The store needs to update the playlist they use for music in the store lol. "
good,I learned a lot during my time at Urban Outfitters. My coworkers and managers were extremely friendly and it was a very relaxed environment to work in.
good,"A fun company to work for, with great perks and management benefits. However there seems to be a huge disconnect with corporate higher ups and store level associates. As well as a huge disregard for store needs and unrealistic deadlines."
good,great place if you like to do you. some opportunities for advancement if the management can dig you. good because of the benefits. can be cool to work during holiday time.
good,"greeting customers and helping them with purchases, communicating and meeting people made this job a great way to open up my networking skills. loved talking and learning of peoples likes, and dislikes of certain fashion. open to all cultures."
good,"I was a department manager for Urban Outfitters for 3 years and this was my second role as management in retail. "
good,It was a very strict but fun job and good crew to be a part of  everybody worked well together at times the job got tuff but nothing I couldn't handle plus I had the opportunity to work with people from all over the world managers wasn't too bad they wanted us to do a job and we did it 100% the hardest part was doing someone else's job cause they were too lazy .
good,"-sewing the actual styles"
good,Pretty good place to work. I've been a sales associate there for a couple years now. I understand that it's retail but raises are like never a thing. I feel like I do too much and get paid too little there
good,It's a very amazing place to work and advance if that's what you're looking to do. Your days off and schedule preference depends on you so that makes it fun.
good,"The vintage atmosphere is unrivaled. Typical day involves the usual clothes folding, neat stacking, fitting rooming, cash wrapping, and ultimately customer servicing. Management will play their roles, and rightfully so, regardless of how chill they seem. Urban culture is an exceptional place unlike any other. There is nothing hard about the job, except maybe the rare rudie every now and then, but even them are handled courteously. Most enjoyable part of the job is mingling with customers and assisting them with providing what they want."
good,This job taught me customer service and efficiency. I really loved it most days. The pay wasnt awesome. And most of the employees were pretty jaded. That made it difficult to enjoy the gig.
good,I love UO!  Honestly a great place to work and encourages growth and creativity.  You meet a lot of different people along the way that will foster your creativity and encourage your growth within the company if that is something you an interested in!
good,"Cleaned warehouse."
good,"had great fun working here "
good,"when I had my first official contracted job at  Urban Outfitters Camden, I was able to interact with co-workers easily because they were really friendly and welcoming. I then learnt more about the urban fashion has started to explore my creativity. I enjoy working in an environment where I am able to take control and express my ideas."
good,"Working here is great! The people there couldn't be nicer, which makes working retail easy. I've learned a lot about the business aspect of the job. The in's and out's of day to day functions and what goals need to be meat. I've also learned how to handle all types of people and how to approach situations with customers that may not be ideal so they leave satisfied. I've leaned how to balance individual tasks and group tasks, and how to take charge if something has to be done, A typical day in the work place involves interacting with numerous customers as you work to get new product out on the floor. Also you manage associates and make sure they are customer servicing correctly and if there is no customers then they are working on bettering the environment of the store. For example cleaning or processing shipment."
good,"It is a culture to be a part of.  It is laid back and has a feel of a small company, but then there are times where it is very corporate."
good,It was a nice experience overall working her but I feel there were a lot of miscommunications between the managers and employees.
good,"I love the company and their culture. I think that this was just a new store and it had a lot of opportunities. Each manager would take their turn floor supervising different hours during the day. the other hours were free for our departmental work or other duties that might have been assigned to us or needed to be taken cared of. The hardest part of the job (for any job) is always the people you have to work with. Everyone is so different and brings a different energy to the store. The best part was that we all felt like we were a family, but this is how it's like at most places on the island. I loved my co-workers; they got me through the days."
good,Most enjoyable parts of the job are that you get to represent your own style and where what you like and be who you are. Met a lot of cool people there. Pretty standard retail setting otherwise.
good,Great place for a first job and awesome for making connections and being surrounded by good people. Lack of positions to move up and compensation is on the low end for everyone. Great employee discount though and nice amount of hours available.
good,"Urban Outfitters is a great company to work for especially in college or the first years out of college.You can make some great friends, the discount is great, as well as the culture."
good,I sort through merchandise and pack them for customer orders. I have learned a lot about the different companies such as Anthropology and Free People. My co workers are nice and easy to get along with. We work well together and much teamwork is involved. I enjoy looking through the different clothing.
good,The most enjoyable aspect of my job was being able to speak to and assist customers. I was able to express myself while developing skills in such a creative work space.
good,"As a manager, typically we would spend part of our shift tending to department responsibilities and tasks to ensure we are improving business in comparison to the previous year.  This would include working with merchandisers to ensure that product was being properly and evenly represented in the store, referring to data reports to see how changes in merchandising have hurt or improved business for specific item classes, sharing product knowledge with staff to ensure they were able to not only sell the product but find a way to connect with the customer as they do it, and back-of-house organization.  What I've learned from this position is that using your people and proper delegation is important for being able to accomplish all of the demands of the job.  It is easy to fall into the habit of wanting complete control, however realistically, one cannot run a department on their own.  In terms of management, I felt a lot of support from my fellow managers.  Out of all of the department managers, I was the newest, and they were always willing to give me a hand or give me tips or criticism when I needed it in order for the store to thrive.  My staff was the best part of the job because I made a point of seeing them as people as not as subordinates.  I respected them and in turn they appreciated me as a manager and were always willing to do what I asked without push-back.  The hardest part of the job was probably the conflict of direction from upper management, which was consistent in our store.  However, through that, I was able to learn how to prioritize and not get caught up in"
good,"I enjoyed working here for the most part, I would go back if I was younger. I loved talking to people and trying the products when I was allowed. Clean, Organized and my co-workers were friendly."
good,"Every day brings new obstacles, which I like. I've learned a lot of different software/hardware & working with different kinds of people. I work with great, energetic workers. I really like here at Urban, but unfortunately they are relocating."
good,Pretty nice place to work at besides some of the management staff. Most people work great together and training in whatever position you want to work toward is offered.
good,"My job consisted mostly of assisting customers, folding clothing, and cleaning the sales floor after closing."
good,The days were always busy and productive with the right balance of fun. I learned about buying being able to participate in the process in a very hands on manner. I had a lot of responsibility which was great seeing as though i was only and intern. Most of the people in the office were very friendly and inviting. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with everyone in the office seeing as though it is a very fast paced environment and process. I loved being able to meet with vendors and help choose product that went to stores and online.
good,"A typical day would be attending the fitting room, or maintaining the large sales section or attending the shoe & accessories department. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Urban Outfitters. I worked as a picker until I was hired on permanent. I was promoted to Shipping Lead and scheduled for every weekend. I've learned much from working at Urban . Picking, packing, receiving, shipping, induction, wsi software, writing BOLs, etc. I think Urban for the type of experience they have provided me."
good,great fashion and very cool urban place to work. Lots of cultural people with many different styles and uniqueness.
good,"At urban outfitters call center I was hired on as a seasonal, then was asked if I would stay FT and take a promotion along side with the FT/Benefits. I was promoted from phones to email representative. A typical day was walking in with our badge, then setting up out computer for the day. We had daily and weekly goals, and thats how we were measured on our productivity. A day we had to do emails an hour. (reading, opening account, finding the issue/answer, responding, making sure its correct, and then sending with proper signature) For my shift it was 150 emails a day. We were graded on 3 randomized emails every other week. I was still expected to take calls when the Que was high. Overall I enjoyed the environment the most, very loving and caring people."
good,"Basically what I experience at Urban is a fun retail job that allows me to be around fun people that enjoy the same music and fashion that I do.  The management team is super fun and laid back, everyone cares so much about the store that there's some major team building that happens, but everyone's so fun that you kinda forget youre working.  I know WHAT could be the downfall? The only one is that you're hired with about 30 other people and you don't get nearly the amount of hours you need. Sucks. But rocks all the same."
good,"I enjoyed working there because it was a very decent and chill enviroment, management was reasonable and wasnt too pushy."
good,A day at Urban will go by in the blink of an eye. Doing your best to help every guest with great customer service surely makes it a fast paced environment. Management is great for asking any questions you need help with product knowledge.
good,"Working at Urban Outfitters was a wonderful experience, I would definitely work there again if I lived in a city that had a store. Everyone that works there is very friendly and helpful. The managers definitely stick out here compared to other jobs that I have held in the past, all of them were awesome and did a great job. Most of the time I would either be somewhere in the women's department or down in the basement where the sales department was. Both spots are very customer oriented, its all about making sure they have what they need while also making it a point to keep the shopping and working area clean and organized. The hardest part of this job was the times when there didn't seem to be enough workers around so I would have to manage the fitting rooms, looking for different sizes in the back room, as well as taking care of customer and store phone calls in order to locate certain items. Other than that, I loved everything about this job. My coworkers were a true joy and I enjoyed the customers to the fullest as well."
good,My position with Urban Outfitters gave me quite a bit of firsthand experience with consumer retail.
good,I would make sure the store is following operations according to company code. Managed around 5 to 15 people at one time.
good,"Slackers need not apply! The company is amazing at branding itself, so you'll be thrown off if you think that working there will reflect the experiences you had as a customer (Anthropologie in particular). There is a lot of hard work and little rest involved in full-time management, but the company is great about encouraging and promoting their hard-working employees."
good,"Nice company to work for very nice management , Great workplace nice flow very well maintained, would recommend this place to anyone layed back management"
good,"If you are looking for a job that will have you going and keeping you busy, this is the job for you. They need fast learners who are willing to put the hours in to see the store succeed."
good,"You basically spend all day folding clothes, putting clothes away, organizing clothes... it gets repetitive. if you don't have an interest in fashion then you'll get bored real quick. Surprisingly, I enjoyed handling the clothing because I liked making it all organized, and I liked to look at each style, etc. "
good,"Great benefits, nice people, beautiful campus. In my group they hired management from outside so there really was no career path. Vacation and holiday exceeded expectation and I thought the salary was decent  Great holiday party and other functions throughout the year."
good,"Relaxed, retail job. Mostly folding piles of clothes and communicating well with customers. When itʻs slow with customers itʻs a slow work shift. Itʻs a good first job to gain experience."
good,"Non - stressful"
good,Overall Urban outfitters has good corporate culture and also great benefits . They are pretty laid back and also good work enviornment . The discount is a great benefit
good,"My time working at Urban Outfitters was okay at most. The pay could have been a lot better especially cost of living going up pay could be more respectable if at least started at 9.50 training then 10 for actual pay. The hours depends on the payroll or the amount of people who work their. I worked there while at school and I barely made enough to hold me over a week. Only way to make respectable pay is covering other shifts or picking up extra. Besides pay the work environment was great, and the employee discount made it worth it but don't spend all your money giving it back."
good,Its chill and fun. Everyone is nice and professional. Management is great. I enjoy the work environment. The clothes are nice however I feel the quality has gone down. The music is great.
good,"good work environment with good perks , managers are very cool and eager to teach about the job. I learn something new every time i walk in the store, i get ecstatic for the day ahead"
good,"At the beginning everything was well. I truly relished working there. Everything changed when I began seeing favoritism within employees and poor management began to stand out from my own manager. I have always liked retail, for I enjoy the quick pace of it. Nevertheless, it is difficult to be motivated to come to work when you're treated as a simple employee. "
good,This jobs is as well work with clothes. This jobs intresting that are not very hard. This work requires more experience and English. It really is very good for advanced people. He may not be suitable as a beginner. Just that is my opinion. This work has great opportunities for improvement. Great team. I like it.
good,"While i found working here extremely fun, it lacked any real challenge or advancement that I seek in a great job. Would still recommend working here as a part-time or first job."
good,"Not a bad place to work, benefits are good, plenty of hours to work, a lot of good people that you work with, lots of over time, plus personal days that are paid for,"
good,"Urban Outfitters had a great atmosphere and a fun, caring team of employees. The hours were inconsistent from week to week, but employees are able to switch shifts with others or give up a shift with sufficient notice. Dependent on what department you are working in, a shift can be very busy or fairly relaxed."
good,"They were very accommodating with school schedules and very flexible when asking for time off. When I was hired, there was not any rush for me to be cash wrap trained but I did not feel adequately trained in that area compared to everything else.  Later on, the need grew for more sales associates to be cash wrap trained right away and that seemed to be overwhelming for new hires. Overall, it was a pretty laid back job and a super easy part time job. Managers provided feedback and were there when you needed them."
good,Overall  I really enjoy working at urban because of the people i met and the growth i have developed in my different positions within the company. Also being able to have a flexible schedule.
good,"Excellent family vibes and creativity with all employees and management. I was doing work for management and getting paid as an associate, which drove me to go back to school to get out of retail. Fun place to work to get through college, but compensation was not fair."
good,"It's a fun first job and/or for students. Weekends are the busiest and can get crazy but it helps to keep you active. By the time I left there was a better balance of long and short shifts being doled out to sales associates throughout the week. Many opportunities to take on more responsibility and move into leadership positions within the store and company. Very supportive management team at the Durham store in particular. Like all other retail jobs the hardest part of the job can be the customers but if you stay knowledgeable of policies, products, and sales you will excel and take a lot of the pressure off yourself. Best part is the fashion and creativity you'll be inspired and surrounded by and the employee discounts."
good,"my colleagues were really nice and friendly. It was a fun atmosphere to work in, and we always had stuff to do. However I didnt get my last paycheck so that sucked."
good,"Depending on the store, you can have a great experience or a lame one. My coworkers have all been cool, the discount is pretty nice and the customers are generally mellow. Really, it's up to management. The store I started at was amazing! Management was like family in the best way possible. They cared about the worker's well-being, personal life, and were just overall genuine in all their interaction. They weren't very passive-aggressive and just told you how it was, in a professional yet chill way."
good,"A typical day at URBN consists of putting your things upstairs before clocking in, informing service lead that you are here for your shift, checking the break sheet to see where you're zoned, being allowed two 10-minute breaks for 5 hour shifts, half hour break for 6 hour shifts, 45 minute break for 7 hour shifts and an hour break for 8-hour shifts. Finally, getting checked out by a manager/security, clocking out, and you are all good to go!"
good,"Relaxed atmosphere, store goals provided at the start of each day which gives the associate constant reminders of what needs to be accomplished. The hardest part of the job can be unruly customers but not to often dealt with."
good,Working at Urban Outfitters was the first retail job i had. It opened my eyes to the retail industry and my future within it. Your work environment is always changing but it is how you influence it that matters.
good,"Honestly, I love working at Urban. There is a good balance of creative, challenging, and new projects, though I very rarely feel stressed or over-worked. I'm surrounded by talented and encouraging coworkers, and the atmosphere is very relaxed for the most part. I generated many portfolio pieces and work that I was proud to contribute within the first year. The only downside I would say is a very slow progression of career advancement within the company based on skills and merit, and some confusion within the management hierarchy due to ever-shifting roles and high turn around. Philadelphia is cool but not somewhere I'd personally like to live permanently, though I'd recommend trying it out for yourself."
good,I loved working among other creatives. Overall a great experience. The discount is fantastic. Scheduling is at the mercy of the managers. Sometimes hard to get shifts covered if you are a working artist.
good,Fun workplace. Free to be yourself. Chill management. Hard work pays off. Opportunities to grow within company. A lot of physical work. Easy-going management.
good,"Working at Urban outfitters was a good experience  if you are starting out in retail. The vibes were always energetic and lively, the employees are very sociable and treat one another well. Management is understanding."
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits but the progression in store was weak. Lots of competition for roles in store which meant that you were often working for targets and jobs that were rarely available."
good,working here was a fun job for a young person who is just looking to get their foot in the door and get general work experience. The benefits are great for someone who also likes to shop at OU and related companies (under the OU umbrella).
good,"Everyday you work a set 8 hour schedule unless asked to work over time, in which you will  be expected to work 10 hours by showing up an hour earlier and leaving an hour later.  I have learned a lot about how distribution centers work.  The management is very professional and try to create a good work environment for their staff.  The management is also willing to work around days off that are needed.  The hardest part of the job is during peak season, employees are expected to work for weeks strait at a time with no days off  and most days will be 10 hour days.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that you are left alone as long as you do your job. Also, there are bonuses and incentives offered for different things and the company is very generous with vacation and personal days."
good,"Urban Outfitters is a great starting job, especially in retail. Customer service will be drilled into your head but it's actually fun talking to customers and helping them pick outfits."
good,"It's a fun and carefree work environment, the people you meet there will become your closest friends. Also the discount you get is absolutely amazing, so amazing in fact that is where your paychecks will go. Only problem is after so much time you grow tired of being just a sales associate making minimum wage , and waiting for higher opportunities to come by but will actually never happen."
good,Reaching daily target whilst being accurate. Working as a team. Several managers. A different manager for each department.Urban feel very highly about culture in the workplace. Being left to get on with the job. Hardest part of this job will be giving negative feedback to work colleagues.
good,Working at Urban was really fun. It was super relaxed; we interacted with customers and tried to make their experience unique. You meet many different people that you will be able to use as networks for the future.
good,"The working conditions are very calm and Steady, there is always work but there is rarely ever no work. Stations have plenty of space for people to monover. Most stations are organized for easy working conditions"
good,"Most workdays are fast paced, yet never too overwhelming. The majority of your day is spent arranging inventory and tending to customers. I've learned an incredible amount about retail and the trends that keep the company going. The company has switched to focusing on customer service so the city and surrounding area really contribute to the feel of the store. Advancement is the hardest part, unless you are willing to relocate to another store or are favored for a position it's hard to stand out. Urban has been hands down the funnest place I've worked because of coworkers and the environment. Most coworkers I've had are easy going and it's a really enjoyable workplace."
good,Fun creative place to work but not good for paying bills. People are easy to talk to and make you feel like you're a part of something. You get to be around fashionable people.
good,Urban outfitters is a fun place to be yourself and with hard work their is opportunity for growth within the company. The company itself has fun ways to interact with other members of the team and get to know each other.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. I was very productive,proactive, communicator, teamplayer,and got well with everyone"
good,the vibe was great it a great job it opens door. it shows you how it is to work in a friendly environment where your co workers are like family
good,it was nice working with people. i like being at the cashier. handling money is very easy to me. i like the management. the most enjoyable part of the job was when i would have a busy day and i got everything done.
good,"very cultured work place, learned a lot of management skills and display work, co-workers were like an extended family, hardest part the management wasn't the best or most organized."
good,"Working for Urban Outfitters would be one of the most goal demanding jobs that I would approve. Being apart of a company who not only promoted where hard work was due, but would teach, and build structure for future advancement. Time would be used wisely and effeciently, attitudinal issues came and went, but would never get in the way of business and work. For the most parts high energy was kept, we worked as a business as well as an family oriented company. And understanding of difficult situations."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty good. I learned a lot about style and the company. The Management was okay not as good as you would think but it was decent. My co-workers we're pretty good, I enjoyed being around them. The hardest part about the job was closing the store at night. The most enjoyable thing about it was the activities we had for customers and also the discount we had as an employee."
good,The company allows its employees to seek out growth in various areas of the country and promotes from within far more than without so once your foot is in the door it's a good place to grow.
good,"You will always find something to do, no matter the location. I've learned more about customer service here than any other job. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with magnificent people."
good,I have learned to be more open minded and patient working here. All the managers and my coworkers are different and creative which my my workplace very interesting and enjoy going to work.
good,"Urban Outfitters was a very fun place to work and everyone was fun and helpful especially the managers . "
good,I'm in the Benefits Dept. We deal with all things benefits and HR related.
good,This job is flexible and also allows you to be yourself style wise.
good,"Before the shop opens at 10am the manager called all the staff to tell them what they have to do, if they have any complain suggestion etc. when the shop opens everybody goes into their duties and one day i have to tag some shoes on put them in the display, while i was puting the shoes on the display some customers asked me to find the right  size of their favorite shoes in the display, after finishing with the shoes i went at the changing room where i had to take the clothes that customers tried on and they didn't buy them and put them back on the display, around midday i had to go to the staff room and tagg cloths and shoes arrived 2 days ago. one hour before finishing my job for that day i had to steam some cloths for the following day."
good,"Very unorthodox, yet professional. FUN! Had a computer in the back where students could surf the web, do homework on break and/or come in early/stay late to finish. Thought that was neat. Great discount"
good,"It's a fun place to work, it keeps you busy but entertained at the same time. I love helping the customers and seeing everyone taste in fashion. It's an awesome place to be yourself and express yourself through clothing. My co-workers are all welcoming and fun to be around; yes we may have differences but at the end of the day we are all a family. The managers are great and outgoing people, they try to make everyone strive to their fullest. I've learned to accept my individuality and not hide it anymore. I've also learned to just pay attention to more than one thing. The hardest part would be just be the cleaning part of the store, but it's not really hard just a lot of work. Otherwise, everything else is great."
good,"Whilst doing my work experience at Urban Outfitters I would usually be in the stock room sorting clothes and making sure everything had a tag, I would then go onto the shop floor and deal with customers. I learnt how to work under pressure in a retail environment and how to greet a customer and deal with them properly. I would say the store was managed very well, everyday the new stock delivered would have a tag and be in the correct place, whether that would be on the shop floor or in the stock room. I didn't really struggle whilst working there but if I had to choose I would say how fast stock came into the stock room and then how fast it had to be sorted. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be dealing with customers which was something new."
good,nice place overall just have childish leads in some area which will try their best to eliminate competition when they see new good workers.
good,"Working here was great, management was amazing and so were my coworkers. I didn't really have a problem with any of the work or anyone at work. Its a shame that it was only seasonal but I did learn how to properly do stock and put outfits together for anyone was in need of assistance . Folding wasn't bad and doing stock helped keep me occupied. I can't really find anything bad to say because I was treated with respect and everyone was kind and friendly."
good,I really like urban outfitters it was an pleasent envirmonet with everyone had tons of energy
good,"*I would assist customers with placing their internet and catalog orders, making sure that their orders were shipped out on time, confirming their billing information was correct, and made sure that there was no fraudulent activity on the accounts with their credit card information."
good,"Every morning Monday through Friday I put out Womens Accessories which include jewelry, bags and shoes. I also train other employees on cash registers and inform them of different policy changes in the store. I assist customers with shopping. I shadow managers and currently in training to become a manager.  The most enjoyable part of the job is training others and the hardest part is finishing shipment when I'm suppose to ring up customers all day. There is a lack of coverage in the store, so I'm mostly doing more than five things at once. I learned to step up as a leader. I gained more confidence in my work and take pride in what I do."
good,"Urban Outfitters promotes a relaxed environment and encourages it's associates to embrace their inner selves. The goal of the store is usually to have great sales while enjoying yourself. The management is a bit shaky. Some of the managers treat their associates fairly while others, not so much. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers and theft. But the most enjoyable part is the customers. You meet a variety of people and it's a very upbeat place. Co workers usually feed off of your vibe and are great for the most part."
good,"Retail is retail, but it helps to have a team that makes you feel like a family. The managers really do work around your school schedule and are very understanding of your status as a student."
good,"A typical day at work included opening the store, placing product, etc. We would have a steady influx of customers most days. My duties included floor selling and fitting room sales, floating : finding items for customers in the store and over the phone, and cash register procedures. I learned how to deal effectively with all types of people. I also gained quite a fashion sense. The management was very thorough. My co-workers came from all walks of life, differing cultures and ages. it was a fun place to work. The hardest part of the job was being pulled in many different directions in a fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting so many different people as well as being able to satisfy the customer with an exceptional product line and second to none customer service."
good,Urban Outfitters is a fun place to work. Not your typical retailer.
good,"• Store duties consist of: opening and closing the store by counting registers and safe to make sure they are even; payroll, banking, shipment, receiving, and planning floor schedules."
good,Urban is a great company for anyone interested in working in a diverse atmosphere. Every employer has their own distinct identity. This compnany records high volumes of sales and business. Great retail store with alot to offer.
good,"If you can deal with the corporate, repetitive rules and tasks then it really is not a bad place to work. The staff/coworkers were awesome people and very friendly. The work environment was always positive!"
good,Some of the work is pretty boring but the managers are willing to rotate people on a daily basis to break up the Monotony of the work. Management was also very fair and would work around my schedule if need be.
good,"Being a Picker and Sorter always kept someone busy. The constant moving and peeping would keep you going. long 12 hour shifts all seven days of the week. good money, no sleep."
good,"I learned a lot about customer service, excelled in communication skills, and gained experience. Supervisors were good people, and good leaders. The most enjoyable part was probably the environment and being a part of a team."
good,"The Urban Outfitters team created a delightful sense of creativity making each day different and eventful. An independent position indeed, most associates used their own sense of judgment and common sense to fulfill the needs of the patrons. With many opportunities to grow associates made their way through many situations they'd never thought they would face in a somewhat seemingly easy going store. It was definitely an experience to remember."
good,"Working at Urban Outfitters entails being observant of your surroundings, quick learning, and constant team work."
good,"Give us your opinion about a typical day at work; what you learned ,management workplace culture, the hardest part of the job, the most enjoyable part of the job"
good,Urban was always on the trends and very innovative on what is new and different in the industry. It was fast paced but always a fun atmosphere to work at. The culture was creative and the executives were available to the employees when and if needed.
good,"Urban outfitters, was a different place to work in due to their quirky vibe which I quickly adapted to and fell right into the culture of the brand and the store. Enjoyed my time there thoroughly"
good,Management and warehouse team were amazing and helped with training as needed.  the inbound teams work very hard to ensure that the inventory recieved was passed to our team in an orderly manner
good,"the job can be somewhat annoying and i could only last for 10 months there just because retail isn't my thing, but i loved working there. i made some best friends there and it was a good work experience as intro to sales."
good,"This is a decent job to have when you're young and first starting out retail. Management is caring and understanding (for the most part). I learned a lot of social skills while working here since the main part of your job will be communicating with customers. It's an easy job if you do what you have to do: greet customers, tidy up fixtures/sections of clothing, listen to management, be aware of loss-prevention. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the generous discount and meeting new people (customers and employees)."
good,I had a great time there. People were friendly and the workspace was great. It was little hard at first but over time I got used to it and was doing a little below average.
good,"The work load itself was fine, i enjoyed my day to day role. Im interested in fashion so working at urban was a good way to see many different styles."
good,My store location did have a higher percentage of shoplifters but the managerial staff was always ready to help. My favorite part of working there was my co-workers
good,"Best co-workers you could ever ask for and a quite healthy working enviroment. There's nothing really bad I can say, except trying to get covered or calling out for emergencies/things out of your control is a hassle."
good,"Urban Outfitters was a fun place, and was located in the heart of the West Village.  I was able to express myself creatively, and was responsible for dressing our mannequins according to the production of each product."
good,"If your a young boy/girl looking for a job, then Urban Outfitters is definitely the right place for you! Full of young and friendly people your job won't ever get boring."
good,"Empresa con buenas condiciones higiénicas, buen clima para trabajar"
good,"worked at UO  part-time (Less than a year)"
good,"Easy to make a lot of friends and a great social job. You can move up if thats your goal but you need to start young, they don't care about education."
good,"""	Maintained constant presence on sales floor to address customer needs "
good,"Great place with good, smart, fashionable people. Work pace varies throughout the day.  Managers are pretty understandable and the discounts and pretty okay"
good,"I would usually start mid shift and close down. I loved the creative environment, new trends, and cool people that you can network with. I would usually close around 10 30 or sometimes 11. It was always a good day to work because you can be your self and help people find what they are looking for. My favorite thing about working at Urban was the 40% discount they gave us also meeting new people every day."
good,"The modern vibe of the store is engaging and exciting, despite the management failing to provide equal and fair timetables. The team and the people that work there are great people, you feel like a family after 2 weeks"
good,"A fun and interesting place to work because of the fellow employees, but as tedious and mind-numbing as any other retail job. Discount is exceptional."
good,helping customers with whatever it is that was needed and making sure that their experience in the store is one they'd want to have again.  Making sure they store always looked up to par.
good,I enjoyed working for urban outfitters they were very associates and managers as well as the hours were good and the pay was great. I would recommend this job to anyone who likes customer service.
good,"Overall, management and employees were super helpful in the training process as well as answering further questions I had down the line. Hours were cut quite often but overall motivational workplace."
good,I worked during the holiday season. All of the employees were pretentious and rude. I worked the sale room primarily which mean I was picking up and hanging the same shirt over and over again every five minutes. Only perk is 40% off merchandise which was awesome.
good,Creative freedom and allowed to contribute in all facets. Ability to grow and move around different departments. Long hours and location of Philadelphia difficult to manage.
good,Urban Outfitters was a very vey fun job id definitely reccomend it for someone just starting out in the retail world very flexible schedule and style!
good,"I completed work experience there and the work colleagues were helpful and friendly. They helped you get started it off, so you can do the job properly."
good,"I have learned a TON from this company, within a few months I was given an opportunity for a promoted leadership role and was taught both the business and artistic aspects of running my own department. I was VERY supported by my prior store manager and department manager, who invested a lot of time pouring into me and teaching me their own knowledge. There is an incredible sense of community in my store particularly, and I've made many wholesome friendships with people whose relationships go far beyond a mere coworker. The management encouraged planning bonding events both in store and outside, and give a lot of love to aiding in the expression of and encouragement towards their employee's artistic endeavors. The hardest parts of my job was very often receiving conflicting instructions from different managers on a daily basis (i.e. how one manager would expect something to be done or performed, and then having another reprimand you for doing so and saying it should be carried out in the exact opposite manner), which could definitely be frustrating, but does understandably come with the territory of a company which supports and encourages individual leadership styles and innovation of ideas (which I personally really respect and find necessary to all industries, and I value the importance of treasuring humanity's individual contributions striving from their unique perspectives). I think URBN has managed to pull this off overall pretty successfully from a professional business platform, in taking advantage of their employee's unique contributions to be able to best apply to their"
good,I loved that we all had the chance to be involved in creating pieces for the displays and exploring our own creativity at work. Our suggestions were taken into consideration and everyone was treated equally.
good,"Awesome place to work, managers will work with you if you want to move up in the company. Really good discount, not just for urban but for free people, anthropologie and other brands within the company."
good,Good place to start if you are interested in retail.  The pay is okay for someone who is still living at home with parents or who needs a part time job.
good,"Typical retail position, generally laid back, but depends on management. Very cool products and company culture. Working at different locations definitely highlights the significance management makes store to store in what it is like to work for this company. A lot of  flexibility and liberties given to management."
good,I love working at Urban Outfitters. The people are great and so is the environment. Its a beautiful place to work. The clothes are trendy and urban...
good,Looking for a chance to better myself and get a second chance in life. I have a very good skills in listening to others and giving good advice. I'm looking for a chance to better myself
good,"I was in charge of working the floor most days, so I would rerack and reorganize clothes and attend to customers, which was the most important part. The store was very focused on customer satisfaction and loss prevention, so working with people was a must. The employees were very lax and fun and I enjoyed my time. The breakroom was a bit small."
good,Working at Urban Outfitters Herald Square is a great experience.  Day in and day out I enjoy going to work and making great things happen with my coworkers.  I learned how to manage a retail environment successfully and how to operate a business at store level.  The culture is amazing and open.  The people are amazing.
good,"At Urban Outfitters, we used farm vegetables and hormone free proteins. We prepared fresh food for 1200 people daily. The hours were great and the work atmosphere was very lively."
good,"This was my first job and it gave me experience interacting with customers in a usually fast-paced environment. The atmosphere of the store as well as coworkers were great. The downside was that because we were so many employees at our location, it was difficult to get hours."
good,"I love being a sales associate at Urban Outfitters. I've worked at two different locations and both have been pleasant experiences. The management want you to succeed and they're approachable and fun to be around. The company treats you nicely and no matter where you are on the ""food chain"" you get the same benefits."
good,Stocking and helping customers was a great experience. There was many employees who came and went very quickly and there was large staff. Was my first retail job and learned a lot about shipping and receiving as well.
good,"You will be trained how to approach customers and how to communicate with the entire team. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for 5-9 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is the bond you create with coworkers, the workplace culture is friendly and trendy so if you have a love for teamwork and fashion, this is the place for you."
good,Es una Empresas muy buenas la recomiendo a todos es bueno trabajar alla.
good,"Great retail space and environment"
good,"I found that working for urban outfitters allowed me to use both my creative and customer service skills together. "
good,Urban Outfitters was a good company that I enjoyed.The pay was good.The hours were good and my co-workers were the best.
good,Working for urban was a nice productive environment. Our typical day of work was restocking and folding merchandise and making sure everything was nice and neat. what i learned from this company is being very organized and memorizing product information. Also dealing with any type of customer in a friendly manner. My co-workers all helped each other in different tasks. The hardest part of the job was being consistent because the job does get tiring after a while. It was a good work place to work to learn the ropes as a sales associate.
good,A typical day was awesome loved this place but clocking in getting my computer picker. Once i get that i would go check my stand up lift checklist. Then i would put my order in my computer and it lets me know where i need to go and pick the order. I don't think it was a hard part in this job unless u was scared of heights. The most enjoyable thing was seeing the things people order and knowing that i was helping get there orders to think.
good,"A typical day at work included, greeting the customers, restock, dressing room management, and organization of the displays and the store. The environment was fun but professional"
good,"Basically I worked in Packing Department- and there I learn new stuffs, like the way they're packing, some brands like Free People, Beholding and Anthropology you have to wrap all the products, then pack, but all ways you have to  scan first, because those products or items has packing list, which they call ""CALLATE"". They have nice lunch room, they have a place to relax up the building, they're more to say."
good,Store is typically not hectic. Store is usually well kept and tidy. Co-workers were all nice and down to earth. Gives a great discount to workers.
good,"Just generally keeping the shop floor tidy, replenishing stock and serving on the tills. Very well organised and fun management. Great team."
good,"The culture of the Urban Outfitters organization was incredible and very energizing, but had little place for advancement."
good,"o	Work as a district team, traveling to support other stores when needed."
good,"The particular store that I worked at in San Francisco was five stories and there were almost 200 employers total. There are so many good people working there and the managers are also awesome. The benefits and pay are nice. However, the customers that Urban attracts throw things on the floor and are generally rude and arrogant people. The store itself is very dirty and dusty. There is also only a small square room for the employees. The compensation and benefits make up for the quality of the workspace but all-in-all I would say that I enjoyed my time at Urban Outfitters."
good,Great company to move up in.  Constantly working to improve customer service. Managing others and helping hire new associates.
good,"A typical work day consists of helping customers and cleaning up. Honestly its not that hard of a job, the employees have a cool kid vibe but they're all really nice. I liked that we were allowed to wear whatever we wanted."
good,"If you're looking for a part time job while going to school this is PERFECT for you. It's so laid back, you can wear whatever you want, and you get to meet and work with some really awesome people. I met and made so many great friends working there."
good,"I really enjoyed working at UO it was definitely a Job I would go back to if i could. The environment was laid back, and management really tried working with your schedule."
good,A typical day at work consists of helping customers and providing a clea and shoppable work place.
good,"The main goal of this company is making an enjoyable experience for customers. There were many duties performed daily including greeting all customers and being free to help them at any time. I was also trained on the registers and used them almost every day i work. The most important thing I've learned from this job is how much goes into a company. This was a protocol store and I got to learn and be a part of a lot of ""behind the scenes"" parts of the store that not many people got to see. My managers are simply amazing. I have close relationships with a few of them, and I feel as though they were very fair. They are role models for me, and I admire them for the good job they do in creating a team that does so much. Same goes for my co-workers. The environment of the job was so friendly and made me feel very welcome. I think the most challenging part of this job simply was simply solving some of the customers' issues. I find it difficult sometimes to find a balance between what the customer wants and and what we can do for them. I also found the hours somewhat stressful. The hours can be very long and late and I just am not a person who did well with the ""on-call) shifts. My most favorite part about this job is the community. We are all apart of such a close team that helped and taught each other. That was made me want to come to work and work hard."
good,"Urban is a great place to work. I wish they paid a little more than they do, but other than that, the atmosphere is wonderful, the supervisors are phenomenal, and the environment is perfect."
good,Awesome company with great philosophies. Fun environment with a lot of diversity.
good,"•Acquired skills: customer service, data entry, inventory accountability, and financial reliability."
good,"I loved working at Urban in Nashville. It's in the gulch so it's already a great place. The atmosphere is really laid back and the coworkers are all great people to work with. When I comes to Management, they're great as well, but when it comes to being paid it's kind of rough. Around $7/hour isn't enough to make a living off of. Luckily it's pretty easy to grow with the company."
good,"Your typical sales associate job; I loved my co-workers. I handled registers, fitting rooms, and stocked items."
good,Constantly answering the phone. No down time. Very strict with hours and being on time. Very easy to get overtime. Very great people to work with.
good,"I loved it here! I had the chance to work with a incredibly talented and varied team, and learned many skills that I have been able to take to my jobs since leaving the company. "
good,"A typical busy day at work involves a lot of customer service. When dealing with some customers, a lot of patience is needed. Handling the cash registers as quickly and as efficient as possible is a big must. At times, I have to perform other store tasks, such as checking inventory and packing and shipping out items that were ordered from our store. The managers are always there to answer any of my questions and are always helpful. My co-workers are a lot of fun to work with and we all get along. We work well as a team and help each other out when we need it. The hardest part of my job is that sometimes closing the store takes us until 1am. The most enjoyable part is being able to provide great customer service and knowing that they are satisfied because of the service that I provided. "
good,"Laid back atmosphere, customer service skills are a must. Provide benefits, good for a part time job."
good,Great company that promotes within if you're willing and able to travel to another location within your general metropolitan area and sometimes further
good,"check the HUB for daily information before clocking in. Once clocked in take calls and help customers. workplace culture is fun, great co-workers, check my schedule several times a day since it is always changing. Inconsistent of how we are graded due to a new system but management has not taken any action to correct it. Otherwise I like my job very much. Fun workplace minus management ."
good,This was a lovely place to work with friendly staff and management. I was well looked after and was often offered extra hours to help support me. The pay could have been better but was fairly calculated.
good,"Management just want whats best for them and they only care about their own hours, but make a lot of friends and not a serious place to work. Definitely suggest another job if you seriously need to pay your bills."
good,Opportunity to transfer between stores. Great for college students bouncing between school and home in the summers.  Great work environment for those trying to stay on top of current trends.
good,I learned how big companies operate. I also learned that most managers or team leads were lazy and often put the work on some one with a lesser title but they are still able to reap the benefits. I learned that not everyone is clean like me when it comes to the fitting room area and trying on clothes.
good,My day at work was constantly filled with new and exciting creative challenges to overcome. Deadlines and budgets would help me expand my vision and also develop my prioritization skills.
good,"busy fast paced work environment. I learned to be more spontaneous and meticulous. the management was superb. The wokplace culture was relaxed. the hardest part could be the continuous heavy lifting although assistance is always given. the enjoyable part of the job was the hours, perks, discounts, employee gatherings, and compensation."
good,"I liked working here because the job was not stressful for most people. For the most part, it consisted of talking to people about fashion and everyday life issues to make them feel comfortable enough to shop there."
good,"Urban outfitters HQ is a cool place to work. Very open and friendly, I loved meeting new people and really enjoyed the puppy policy. I learned how to meet the needs for over 500 employees and managed to keep everyone happily satisfied. The hardest part of working with urban would be fulfilling last minute requests."
good,It is a good first job to have. I learned a lot about the retail environment. I really enjoyed the available moving up steps. but overall i couldn't work there for long .
good,"I Worked part time as a sales advisor at UO whilst studying. 3 days a week so I was able to balance work, uni, social quite well."
good,"A typical day was fun, got to do lots of different things on some days. Management was great, really approachable. Workplace was really laid-back, everyone more like friends than colleagues."
good,"I loved working at Urban Outfitters. It was relaxed while being fast paced at the same time. I was never bored and I always had tasks to do. I loved that you could be yourself at UO. You dressed how you felt and were able to express yourself in so many ways compared to other stores that require a dress code. Being able to be my real genuine self in the work place made me much happier and I always enjoyed going to work, even for those 6 am shifts."
good,Different than any management position I've held before.  Given a lot of opportunity to engage with team and develop staff.  Very focused on merchandising and visual presentation.
good,Great job just don't like the way they cut breaks and there isn't nothing to do on the phones. Wonderful people and the call center is so clean. Best call center I've worked for. I just didn't like when I had something really bad happen in my life and spoke with management it was alright. Then I got fired because I couldn't make it because of personal reason and cant work there again. That isn't fair if you ask me when I was doing a great job on the phones and emails.
good,Loved coming into work everyday to hang out with my co-workers. It was a chill relaxed environment. You're able to wear and look how you want. The supervisors were very friendly and helpful. Genuinely enjoyed coming into work.
good,"A typical work day was hard work, but the work team and environment allowed me to succeed in working at Urban Outfitters. I enjoyed the manager and coworkers."
good,The staff is very professional and polite. Everyone on the sales floor is respectful and always has a smile on. Great benefits for full time employees. Pay is adequate.
good,This job was very easy work just had you standing on feet in one. Place but work was easy times and shifts was great..the company was leaving town so they had closed down in my area
good,"Hardest part of the job is the production that at the same time I enjoyed. It keep me busy and not bored. Co-workers are okay some are really nice and real some are not. That's part of life, it's hard to please anybody."
good,"Urban culture is peers-teaching-peers. Down to earth employees, fast past work environment, assist and get to know customers from all over the world!!"
good,There is a lot of freedom to dress the way you want here! Self- expression is not constrained when working for this company.
good,"Was good day , I worked with a lot of women in my department, I've learned how to return items that needed to return . refund the money back to the customer or exchanged items. The most enjoyable was seeing everyone happy, laughing and getting along with one another."
good,always exciting product fun people and plenty of opportunity to grow within teh company good management listen to you and can help tyou achieve your goal what ever it may be.
good,"Typical day at work- walk in put my stuff down and just go straight to helping customers and cleaning."
good,"A typical day at works includes organizing shipment, collaborating in design for the store, and creating an enjoyable vibe for customers."
good,"Very comfortable environment. I work early mornings to afternoons and my day consist of product flow (basically stock), monitoring the shoe department, and the fitting room. Co-workers are very cool."
good,"A typical day at work would vary depending on what zones you were placed in. If you were register trained one day might be spent at the register. If not, you would get placed in different zones depending on the hour. I liked this because it never got boring. I learned a lot at Urban Outfitters. I learned that I wanted to be a fashion merchandiser or a buyer. I also learned that working hard feels very good and is very satisfying. The management could not have been better. I've never seen a store run so well while still maintaining a friendly and fun atmosphere. There wasn't anything I found particularly hard about the job, but a few things did have a learning curve. When you work the register, if you are up there alone, you also have to answer the phone so learning to balance ringing someone up while answering the phone without seeming rude is a bit of a challenge at first. I loved all of the people I worked with and stay in touch with a good bit of them. I enjoyed every aspect of that job."
good,"a typical day at Urban Outfitters includes being given a zone within the store that you are then in charge of for the day. Within this zone it's my job to make sure it's tidy and that i'm approaching every customer that enters this zone and give them the best customer service that i can and help meet their needs. I have learned how to take responsibility of my zone each day and work with all different kind of customers. The management and co-workers at Urban Outfitters are nothing short of amazing, the most friendly, helpful and hardworking team of people i've came across yet! The hardest part of my job is dealing with difficult customers who just cannot accept that you are trying your best to help but at the end of the day this is all part of a learning curve. The most enjoyable part is the satisfaction of knowing a customer has left the store completely satisfied with their visit because of my customer service."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a Daily."
good,"Great place to work, Typical day was helping customers and cleaning up the store. Best part of working here is the co-workers and laid back work environment."
good,"- working in a slow pace store allows more time to get projects done. however, I would much rather work somewhere fast pace "
good,"The typical day at work requires a lot of interaction with many different types of customers. My co-workers and I are usually merchandising, organizing, and straightening up the sales floor. Dressing up the forms and putting out shipment is also in a days work. The management is relaxed and usually provides a list of general things to do, but the employees get to work out the details. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability for the employees to use their own ideas an creativity when working on projects. "
good,My daily duties were the register.
good,"This is a cool spot to work. Pretty easy job overall. However, it lends itself to the brown noser. If you're not explicitly liked by management your hours will be terrible and they'll treat you just as bad. No strict dress code is nice as well and you get a cushy discount on clothes. However, you don't get paid enough or get enough hours to get a nice check. Getting paid every 2 weeks sucks too. It's possible to move up with Urban but it takes a lot of patience and paid dues and still at the end of the day if they don't like you then it won't matter."
good,"Ensuring that the customers have a pleasant shopping experience, Maintain the overall day-to-day operations, check daily emails from corporate, bank reconciliation, maintaining promotions and displays"
good,"Depending on the department i would handel money, fold clothes, attend to customers, ect."
good,"During a typical day at work I would either open or close up the cash wrap and the women's accessory fixtures. I would manage the cash register's primarily throughout my shift and I would occasionally work in the fitting rooms or as a greeter at the door. I learned a lot about teamwork and the need to work cohesively with other people in order to maximize productivity. I also learned a great deal about customer service and I now feel comfortable dealing with difficult customer situations. The most difficult aspect of the job was working the long hours because it was always unclear what time I would be closing till and sometimes I would have to stay 4-5 hours after closing to clean the store. Also I worked for minimum wage, which is fine because it was my first job, but I had to inform my store when minimum wage increased in the county because they did not raise my salary in accordance with these changes. The co-workers I had at this job really made the work enjoyable and I appreciate what an awesome team I worked with at the store."
good,"Best retail company ive worked for overall, great to customers, great with employees (from salary to part time) lots of ways to earn extra via bonuses contests etc, freedom to be yourself (not cookie cutter) lots of room for advancement and growth in many different fields/areas within, a great place to work and a fun atmosphere"
good,"Urban Outfitters has waxed and waned with the trends of fashion, but the creativity stayed true.  I was there for the recession, and yes, the business operations had to change, but it remained a pretty fun environment to be a part of.  As a leader, you had A TON of autonomy over your space.  We were afforded the opportunity to do what was best for your business, upper management just asked that you be prepared to speak to your ""whys.""  It's true, the culture sometimes made that difficult, but I sure met a lot of amazing people along my journey."
good,"UO is a fun place to work if you love meeting new people and love branding! Constantly cycling floor stock keeps the store fresh and interesting on a shift-to-shift basis, even. Great personalities tend to work and shop at Urban Outfitters."
good,"Worked for urban during a very large boom.  I loved the culture that urban carried for diversity, love of animals, and willingness to discuss new ideas."
good,"Great place to work for the young fashionables and great progression for staff who want to work their way up in retail, lots of opportunities. Management on the whole are approachable and create a great moral in stores. The benefits are good like holidays and discount, however the management pay needs to be looked at as it is very low compared to other retailers. Some operations need updating but on the whole great place to work if you want to enjoy going in to work every day."
good,I enjoyed my time with Urban. I was able to travel all over the US and meet great people. This job also helped me generate a solid portfolio and resume.
good,"although i have little interest in working retail anymore, i loved working at URBN. i was offered many opportunities for growth from the start and got along well with everyone throughout the company."
good,Working with urban over the years has been great. I've learned and grown so much with the company. During my time here I've been given huge opportunities to advance and have gotten just as much as I've given out of role I've taken on.
good,Fun working environment with great people and great product. A very creative retailer that's constantly changing it's merchandising and displays. Up beat and fast paced work environment with great discount and room to advance.
good,"We'd start off by checking the store out to see if anything needed to be cleaned or put back into place, after we open the store and help out as many customers as possible and maintain the store in the process. What I've learned working there was to always be as polite as possible because you'll never know who you'll meet. Management was great, although they made me feel welcomed they also made sure that we knew when it was go time. The vibe of the store was great even when it was hectic, it was still fun. The hardest part for me were the hours but the most enjoyable part was the people I worked with, they were great."
good,"The workplace culture, and my co workers made all the difference. There was a great sense of community at Urban Outfitters which made working there alot of fun."
good,I enjoyed working for Urban Outfitters because no day was the same. I learned how to display the merchandise based on company sales reports to ensure sales continued to increase. The culture in the workplace was extremely high and motivating because the team was highly motivated and always had fun while working in a fast paced environment.
good,"Answer calls from around the world with a kind and considerate tone with helping the customers with their concerns. I learned that not every call will be a delightful one, but I can make it delightful by caring for the customer. Management is spot on with what they do. The company keeps growing. Co-workers at this job are great to be around. The hardest part about the job is the timing on putting yourself into break when 5 calls are back to back. I enjoy helping customers find what they are looking for!"
good,Urban Outfitters was a clothes and Electronic shipping warehouse. It was also the first to teach me how to use a scanning gun. Since I enjoy working in a fast past it was nt hard for me to meet my quota my first week. They made me feel like i had it going on when they realized it only took me a few days to have my job down completely. The hardest part of the job was finding the product if its lost in a Pallad. That use to upset me when the younger people would talk instead of paying attention to what they were packing.
good,"I like this workplace, it's fun and you get to know a lot of people that work here. During my work here I've learn how to communicate more with my co-worker and especially my higher up bosses. I've also learn all different type of jobs, like receiving product info. and input into the computer and more."
good,"I worked several positions, so the most basic day consisted of attending customers, cashiering, completing daily/weekly tasks, processing and placing product, and cleaning. I learned a lot from management, including what type of manager I do and do not want to be. Employees of all levels developed a tight-knit ""Urban"" family. The hardest part of the job was moving up, or getting recognition for going above and beyond. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom to be creative, and to be creative with the rest of the team."
good,"Every day I work. I work to do my best in mostly everything I can do. For example, If I am going to be a the cash wrap I will do the best I can do by working hard opening and closing and making sure everything looks nice and neat with a smile. Since when I started at Urban Outfitters. I have learn some parts of the business and some partly visuals and as of goals and product knowledge with fantastic workers. We work as a great team. every individual has something to offer and brings to the table for success. The hardest part of the job is working to hard that not many opportunities for promotions are given. although I would like that very much so. I like working. I would work 7 days a week if I had too, I enjoy working with people."
good,"It was a generally good company to work for, it was fast paced, had a fun environment, and there has always been a lot of diversity in who they hired and their different styles which was awesome and everyone meshed together really well. There were three main shifts that you could have: opening, closing, or mid. A typical opening shift began with cleaning the sales floor, straightening up the tables, processing online orders, and begin to tag new shipment. That's just in the first couple of hours. once the store is actually open, then it's just maintaining a fun customer service oriented environment, maintaining the merchandise and the fitting rooms, and pay attention to loss prevention. Mid shifts revolve around maintaining a clean environment and helping out customers as well as paying attention to loss prevention. Closing shifts begin with maintaining the store and at the end of the night, once the store is close, all of the ""go-backs"" are ran to the floor, the floor is ""recovered so it looks as if it hasn't yet been shopped, and the break room is cleaned. The only downside is that management does play favorites, and that was evident in both of the two locations I worked at."
good,"One of the best places I've ever worked. Great job culture, great products and music. Located in one of the nicest outdoor malls in the inland valley."
good,"My job basically consisted of clocking in and gathering all supplies needed to load, package and ship gift cards for urban outfitters and its 4 sister companies, i would complete up to 500 orders a day. Management was outstanding always addressed employee issues, kept the environment very upbeat and casual. the hardest part was sitting for hours doping the same thing repeatedly over and over again. i enjoyed the fact their were constant rewards for completion of orders."
good,"It is a job where you learn a lot, and dealing with the client enriches a lot. the work days are very enjoyable due to the work environment. there was a lot of fellowship."
good,Exelente compañía se aprende muchas áreas como a procesar órdenes arreglar pedidos y entre otras áreas en fin me encantaba el trabajo
good,"Flexible schedules and they try to accommodate to ur availability as best they can. If you want long shifts and there’s extra shifts, they can extend you up to 9 hours. The staff are very nice and and friendly. It is so easy to get along with all the staff, especially the managers."
good,I greatly enjoyed my time working for Urban Outfitters. I wish the schedule was more consistent but that comes with working any retail job. I grew a lot while working for the company. I became a more confident person by taking on more and more responsibilities in my position. They taught me a lot about being a good associate and manager. The teams are always very supportive and encouraging of each other.
good,"It is typical to be on a rotation in regards to where exactly you work at a given time. Each rotation gives the employee a change of scene and job task, always something to do as it is a big store. If well motivated, can be a fun place to work at when busy but in the slow periods it becomes a tad bit boring. The culture is really laid back. People you work with are nice and management team is nice too."
good,I have fun and managers are great their and culture is not bad umm work place is good I was always confterbal  and it's a safe place to work at  I learned a lot
good,It was a great job. Everyday there would basically be the same challenges but over all something new every week. Customers were good and they really liked the brand.
good,"-With the peer teaching initiative employed by UO, you have great opportunities to meet and bond with your co-workers. Questions are always welcome and you get the strong sense that everyone has your back which makes you want to be an equally strong pillar to help support the store."
good,"I enjoyed being part of urban, the house rules made it easy to get along with everyone, and we were all part of a great team. I became a 'buddy' which involved looking after new members of staff, helping with any queries about the job and showing them where to go for breaks, introducing them to other colleagues & generally making them welcome within the company.  I also became part of the health & safety team, this involved regular meetings with other members & management to discuss issues and create awareness to all staff throughout all of the company. (All done in our own time) I was part of 'the fun team' which created & organised fun events for the company to do as a whole... (I.E) charity events such as children in need, race for life, red nose day as well as friendly competitions such as, fancy dress for halloween, pumpkin carving, cake making, christmas fancy dress, easter egg hunt and our annual christmas staff party. All these were also organised and arranged on our own time. I was also asked to become part of a scheme that was designed to help anyone & everyone to be able to communicate effectively & confidently, letting everyone know that any problems they had, no matter how small, would be listened to & dealt with.This was done with small workshop sessions. I had no problems with any of the management, they were always willing to listen to anything you had a problem with, and dealt with it in a professional and when needed, discreet way. "
good,"Is an American multinational clothing corporation."
good,"A typical day at work included greeting customers and finding out what each of them needed. Open and close the cash registers. Performing tasks such as counting drawers, coupons and vouchers. Maintain record related to sales goals amongst fellow co-workers."
good,"I actually loved working with Urban Outfitters, We would always have themed meetings where employees would come dressed up in characters. I loved the upbeat environment of the store! The only reason for my leaving, was at the time the distance from my home to the store was too far."
good,"Typical day is come in early, around 7am, read reports, fill the floor, and finish with assisting customers. Learned how to time manage and train fellow associates. Managers are all really awesome. Great co-workers. Hardest part of the job is not having enough hours in a day. Most enjoyable part about working at Urban Outfitters is the daily interaction with fellow co-workers and customers."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, they allowed me to use my skills and training to the best of my abilities."
good,i learnd to use the computer and ordred lot of sttaf and i always enjoy my time when m at work
good,"Recently, I was employed at Urban Outfitters clothing store in Durham, NC. A typical day at work consisted of coming in at 9:30 am. cleaning the sales floor, folding clothes, restocking the sales floor with different sizes, and managing the cash register. Urban Outfitters is a very team-based job. Everything was done in a group effort to make sure the store ran efficiently. My co-workers were extremely pleasant. There were no altercations ever. The hardest part of the job was the holiday traffic. The crowd volumes were very high. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers that I met and being able to assist them in their drastic wardrobe changes."
good,"Fun place to work, a lot of cool people to work with, management is decent. You have your cool laid back managers & you got your oddly strict mangers who act like someone can get killed if you don’t follow the rules but for the most part it’s a great place to work at. There’s a lot of room to advance. You have to be sure to voice your opinion and thoughts about moving up bc they will listen to you. Company does a biannual employee survery to ask about your opinions of the company and how they can improve. I think it’s a great job for someone who is in school full time and need a part time job. You just have to be up to date with trends and fashion styles and know how to style for a job at UO."
good,Très accueillant et endroit agréable où il y a de bons liens entre les travailleurs et les clients également.
good,The best thing they had was great benefits and supervisor and Manager were great the only thing I didn't like was working 70-80 hours a week.
good,I love working at Urban Outfitters because of the many aspects of business that I learn that can provide a basis for other work opportunities.
good,"The Discount is the best benefit you can get from working at Urban Outfitters. The people you meet is amazing and well, you get to dress pretty much as you want."
good,The Urban Outfitters Company as a whole is amazing. From the diverse sense of style of the interpersonal relationships made within the company. My duties were to ensure all members of my team understood the guidelines on creating healthy & trust worthy relationships with customers & peers. As well as to ensure that every single associates understands the importance of knowing the Urban Outfitters policies. I was to exhibit & lead by example for all employees that customers are our number on priority for without them the business would not be able to operate smoothly.
good,"This job was seasonal so there isn't much to really say. I can say that the money was very helpful it was around Christmas and I was unemployed, I was grateful when they hired me."
good,"Good days bad days, If you like sitting in a cubicle this job is for you. Sending emails all day was not my idea of making a living so I dipped out. The end."
good,"The company is fun to work with, great place to start at helps you become more accustomed to engaging with others and helps bring your communication skills"
good,Have not worked here in over ten years. Do not know what the company is like now. I feel as though my review would be irrelevant.
good,Very fast paced Job. Great People. Worked nights 10 Hrs. Shifts for 30 days straight most of the time. Management was on the take and Safety violations everywhere.
good,"This store is one of the best stores I have ever worked in. Normal days after Christmas are slow but we are still very productive. I learn more of self dependency, working at my own pace but still fast enough to complete my task in a good amount of time."
good,Good work thereJust make sure you get your right pay again I don’t really want to do this being forced to write this review just to get to the resumeApparently I didn’t write enough so just going to ramble on a bit more till it meets the 150 criteria so that I can get to the resume
good,"Being the Women's Specialist at Urban I was able to not only create a one on one relationship with my supervisors, but I was also able to learn more than just sales. I have gained experience and confidence."
good,"(Prao) Arbetsuppgier bestod av att jobba i kassa, hålla hyllor"
good,"I enjoyed working at urban outfitter, it seemed that everyone working there were different but similar  individuals at the same time. There was never any drama the work place and It was an overall great place to work"
good,"è stata un'ottima esperienza, ho potuto implementare le mie predicenti esperienze nelle vendite e nella  promozione dei prodotti,  in un ambiente strutturato, giovanile e dinamico"
good,"It may take you a long time, but it's a company that you can definitely grow with if you're determined. Constantly express your interest or you will be overlooked and someone else who wants the job more will grow."
good,What an amazing place to work. Get to be yourself while letting all your creative juices flow. The teams are all amazing and gell with each other. I love the comradery @
good,I worked at store 34 in East Lansing. It was so much fun! I became good friends with all my coworkers and some of the regular customers who came through. Everybody is very nice and friendly.
good,"As with all retailers, sales is a major factor. Management switches around, but at the time I worked there, employees were treated poorly and looked down upon. Scheduling was okay, they typically give you the number of shifts you want and days booked off in advance. The store's atmosphere really helps to elevate your mood, and you can meet incredible individuals there."
good,It's good help me wit retail and to better my retail sales for the future and to be better at what I'm doin to be at a good place and to be good at sales
good,"I enjoyed my time at the Carltun however, it was not the filed of work I went to school for. I mainly worked there for the benefits and perks, and also a steady source of income to supplement my income from freelancing as a fine artist, illustrator, graphic designer and muralist. I recommend working at The Carltun to anybody who has a passion for the service industry. As with any job I take on, I excelled going above and beyond my assigned tasks and received promotions and was even able to us my design background on a daily basis."
good,Urban Outfitters exploite une excellente culture d'entreprise. Celle-ci m'a permise de monter les échelons rapidement et de mettre à profit mes aptitudes tout en repoussant celles-ci. Cette entreprise m'a permise de grandir et de devenir le travailleur que je suis aujourd'hui.
good,"Driven to provide my employees to achieve more and assist them every step of the way. "
good,"Worked here for about a year. Didn't take long to learn the job. Easy work and laid back environment. Training lasted about two weeks and once I hit the floor everything was a breeze. Only cons of this job are the occasional rude customers, no pay increase, and the point system. Although it was stressful at times, URBN grew on me. This company became like a family to me. Would recommend!"
good,"Employee for over 3 years. The nicest, diverse group of people you could work with! They genuinely keep your best interests in mind and help you grow. I've made lifetime friends over the years here."
good,"great atmosphere very welcoming crew always intending to find what the customers want and need with a smile on their face, the store is also always very clean and organized"
good,"Good place to work,friendly environment."
good,will recommend friends to use this website if they ever need help finding a job. hopefully it will help them also like it is going to help me. has many variations of jobs to choose from
good,"Your fellow employees will be from all backgrounds. Very friendly and enthusiastic people who really embody the company brand. "
good,I loved working at urban outfitters. It is one of my favorite stores and it was a dream come true to be able to have the opportunity to work at the company. The managers and all the employees were very kind.
good,I enjoyed working at Urban Outfitters. I gained alot of experience there. I intend to use my skills an experience in my next job. I learned what not to do and what should be done. I learned alot about my self as well
good,"I worked for this company for over 2 years and I learned a lot about being a sales associate while working here. I worked with shipment, fitting rooms, store maintenance, cashier, and most importantly, customer service with all the guests that entered the store. I had regulars that I enjoyed helping whenever they came in. I felt a team work and management was very well organized, had sale goals for each day, and did well with meeting before each shift to discuss what we're excelling at and what we as a team could do more of. Every 90 days or so we'd have a meeting with a manager to see where we are at in the store and where we'd like to go as far as promotions. I really liked working for Urban Outfitters and would be interested in working for the company again in a higher position."
good,"Very productive place where I learned a lot of things like packing and labeling the packages which contained clothes, makeup, lingerie, etc. Also it enhanced my computer applications skills."
good,Really cool place to work the people here are the coolest most amazing people you could ever come across. They are always helping each other and all :)
good,I was able to be part of a fun and innovative company that allows a flexible work schedule an amazing discount and room for growth. The company is full with amazing people who enjoy what they do .
good,Learning experience. Enjoyed working with the other workers and customers. Great managerial skills learned here. Pay could have been better with all the work that was being put in.
good,"The only issue with this job, the compensation was too low, was not able to take care of all my bills and family efficiently. Other than that a great job"
good,"Overnighting for Urban is the most fun thing to do. You learn about the new products we get in, and we also learn how to interact with each other well. The hardest thing I'd say we do for urban is carrying the boxes from one location to the other. It hurts your back sometimes and when we get a lot of shipment it gets tiring after a while, but the best thing about the job is that you make great friends."
good,it was great. I loved the people the staff and the environment there is was an awesome experience. I learned a lot working here I taught new things that could elevate me higher into the company if I desired.
good,Providing Customer service. Displaying of various merchandise. Cow-workers friendly and unique. The hardest part of this job would be dealing with different personalities consistently. The most enjoyable is being allowing to express your individuality.
good,I love my job and enjoy being around different people. Urban offers unique clothing and vinyls that you won't find at any ordinary store.
good,"We come together as a team and warm up for the shift to excell,i learned how to motavite myself and others to be a better teammate and get our productions done. Management was there to help and assit when needed,i enjoyed working with different people and different departments,the hardest part was keeping up with the line to get the itemsor gifts out when you had at least 5 shoots and all the iteams wrapped,and boxed up to be shipped out.the most enjoyable part was that i was able to work in different departmentsand learn different things."
good,Doesn't feel like work. The environment is very enjoyable even at times when the store gets busy. I consider each and every coworker of mine to be friends. We have created a really awesome team that definitely effects the way that customers treat us.
good,Learned a lot and developed a lot of skills from being a department manager. Working for Urban Outfitters has been a great experience.
good,Urban is a great company to work for. They allow their employees to express themselves with limit boundaries. The management team at Urban New Orleans was incredible. SO intelligent and helpful along with responsible and hard working. They showed me what it takes to be a good leader and how to manage your time wisely and use your creative mind.
good,"From learning how to sell and engage consumers with current retail promotions, to operating the register, processing online orders, and how to log inventory, Urban Outfitters was a great company to work for. I worked with a fabulous team of enthusiastic and motivated managers and sales associates, who were instrumental in helping our store meet our daily, weekly, and monthly goals."
good,"It was hard work. I love fashion, but it was definitely hard work. It was very physical, and more in depth then you realize. But it was absolutely worth it. It was my first job, and I would not trade the experience for the world."
good,"- attending fitting rooms, cleaning the floor, making sure clothes are picked up and folded, working cash register, sales pitching,"
good,"customer service, cashier, store maintenance, and fitting room. daily duties of a sales associate at a retail clothing store in chicago gold coast."
good,I did a lot of sale associated duties. It was a really fun environment and I learned a lot about working in retail. Urban Outfitters is a great company.
good,cool place to work but hours were not compatible with school.
good,"Workplace is far from controlled, employees with higher title break rules. no base infrastructure"
good,"Its been years since I've had this job, but I remember it being quite fun and easy. My co-workers and managers ended up being life long friends that I am still in contact with."
good,Everyday was exciting to interact with new customers and analyze many fashion styles.
good,"Fun upbeat place to work."
good,Great customers and great staff. Nice work place with great music playing to help past time.
good,"I loved this job. Wish I was still working here the people were nice, it was fun and I was happy about work."
good,"* Unload, receive, putaway and inventory stock"
good,"The entire work experience at Urban was very well enjoyed. My coworkers were very friendly and helpful, management was also very kind and always had smiling faces. "
good,the staff is great and the kids are better. I have never worked at a more enjoyable workplace than Children's Courtyard.
good,"I am either assigned to the cash register, fitting rooms or customer service. Customer service is based on serving customers and fixing the standards within the store. The fitting room includes helping customers with sizes and keeping the area and clothing organizing and clean. Cash register includes counting out cash, processing credit cards, and ensuring a positive end to a customers shopping experience. My management is fantastic. They are very direct and helpful yet very friendly and create a positive environment. My co-workers are all very nice and we all strive to help each other whenever we can. The hardest part of my job would be to look out for loss prevention. The most enjoyable part of my job is to work with cool products and great people."
good,This was a factory position. The employees were all very nice and helpful.
good,"what i loved most about working at urban outfitters was the passion i had for the shop, i loved shopping there before i even got the job so when i did i was so excited to start working. the whole ethics at the job was great, it was working for a part of a team selling things we loved ourselves. we had a great team to work with, we all got on with each other great and that made it easy and enjoyable going to work everyday."
good,Urban outfitters provide a fantastic working environment which is not only rewarding but fun to work in
good,"Urban Outfitters allows for creative and hardworking individuals to cooperate with managers and merchandisers to achieve sales goals and continue the overall brand aesthetic. Associates work with managers in merchandising the store and giving customer service to customers who come in searching for anything from housewares, to women's accessories, to men's clothes. This is achieved from: an associate at the front of the store, greeting customers and assisting in through-the-door customer service, associates on the floor or in the shoe departments, associates helping customers in the fitting room, and lastly at the cash wrap."
good,I've learned all my customer service there. The co-workers are so easy to get along with. The management has an open door policy that is awesome. They also listen to things you need.
good,A great place to get your creative juices flowing. Many of the people I work with have great ideas about art and photography and being able to convey this in the way that they dress. Nice relaxed atmosphere to work in.
good,"Depending on which store you work at, the management teams run a little differently just based on personalities and volumes of the stores. Typical day would be coming in, seeing where you are stationed for the hour, and following tasks whether it be the fitting room or cash wrap."
good,It was a decent place to work for a summer job. I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed much past that. With so many managers there were too many figure heads to report to which made it difficult to do your job.
good,"High energy employees, respectable and understanding customers, and a relatable management team."
good,"Fast paced always busy day. Fun place to work, great music. Management was young and great to work with. All of my co-workers were fun and enthusiastic. The hardest part of the job where the unpredictable hours. The part i enjoyed the most was the customer interaction and the clothing."
good,Urban provides a great atmosphere and all the employees are great people. The hours are not great but the job is enjoyable so it makes up for it. Management is great.
good,enjoyed going to work every day great environment.im huge fan of the brands the sale. so it totally made since for me to work for the company.always had great customers
good,"i love working here however i feel like since ive been there i work overtime when asked i have run the prep area being in charge of ten or less employees, prepping work keeping them all on task, printing labels and ensuring proper paperwork goes with proper purchase order. I also run cuba scanner ensuring all merchandising has the correct weight and measurements, i do final sorting, stowing making sure all merchandise goes in proper bins and also labeling and printing paperwork, and i feel like i should be compensated for fast learning. the people are amazing however one of the HR staff took it upon herself to tell my daughters dad i work there which i tought there was client confidentiality.."
good,"Working in Urban Outfitters allowed me to gain a decent amount of retail experience needed for the workplace. I picked up a variety of skills from customer service, decision-making and so on. "
good,"A typical work day includes a safety meeting, and order to be completed. I learned how to stack, task, and hold orders online if the purchase merchandise isn't in the warehouse to be sent out."
good,The people you meet make the job enjoyable. fast pace and you learn about yourself and work ethics you would need in the future. Helps you learn to have patience.
good,"A typical day at work would include enhancing customer service in order to make the sales quota and beat the LY (last year's quota). The management is fun, outgoing, and friendly, as are my coworkers. They manage the workplace through shout-outs (every hour) and are always available to help sales associates with problems or questions without judgement. Urban Outfitters Inc. is a peaceful, young environment and my peers are outspoken, fun, and ambitious. Mostly, I enjoy helping customers with enhanced service to find what they came in there for - a happy customer is a happy employee."
good,"• Ensuring a positive and sincere customer service experience"
good,i only did inventory for this company but it was a great experience.
good,"My store was a bit of a novelty; everyone liked and supported each other. That's not common at all UO stores, and because of that it maintained a significant employee retention rate. Retail always feels a bit soul sucking, but if you let apathy get in the way, you'll never feel fulfilled. Because my team was so supportive of each other we over came obstacles in creative ways and forged friendships from it."
good,The company is amazing to work for but the salary is mediocre compared to other places. The upper level management does to much micro management. Not a lot of job advancement.
good,"You get to dress how you feel and really express yourself through clothing. Fun and relaxed day to day duties. Typical retail job, go backs, helping people find what they need, keeping the store presentable and nice looking."
good,"Working @ this job I learned a lot, I never knew. I made new friends. I made money, and had benefits. I enjoyed the working experience at Urban. Thanks"
good,"Urban Outfitters is the first job I have felt comfortable in especially with having such a big passion for the brand so it has been a pleasure working here for the added bonus of the wonderful discount. I have made some amazing friends for life and have gained new skills from working here. The downside is that I have learnt certain skills but haven't progressed in the company and many new starters seem to be getting more opportunities. They also have just employed lots of new staff but cut all current staffs hours, this is a great inconvenience for I and my other employees that have just left university and are in need of full time work."
good,Had a great time working there and met a lot of great people. There are long hours and you don't use much brain power here. It can feel a little stifling.
good,"My time at Urban Outfitters has been amazing. Although the store can be very busy, management and my coworkers are amazing. The vibe of the store really shows through."
good,"I like the group meetings we would have in the mornings as a team. I would be assigned to different locations in the plant.I learned that you have to be able to read the order form,make sure all items were in the shoots accurately & wrapped individually to be shipped out to the customers.Learnd how to use different micosoft to ship out military items that they ordered,management was friendly & helpful,my co -workers was all differently but was very helpful. The hardest part of the job for me was keeping up on the line when you have 5 shoots to fill orders ,wrap,& put into boxes to put on line to be shipped out.The most enjoyable part of my exprenice was learning different departments of the plant,and finding myself busy & happy."
good,This company is closing and relocating.  The work schedeule is 7 days a week 10 hour shifts.  A typical work day includes doing many different jobs and working hard.  No everyone pulls their wieght.
good,During my stay at urban outfitters I learned a lot about style and being up-to-date on what's hot! The employees were easy going yet edgy. The job was pretty even paced at times and was a fairly great place to work.
good,"Nothing bad to say about Urban Outfitters. Always felt like I was hanging out with friends and not just working. Sadly, hours and money weren't the greatest but the friendships and work environment made up for it."
good,"The job really wasn't that hard. All I would have to do is manage the mens floor of the store. That would consist of helping with sales and making sure the shelves were neat. All of my co workers were awesome. In urban outfitters it is a different type of environment where you can really be yourself, which I really enjoyed."
good,"A typical day is just organizing the store, making sure it's kept up. My co-workers were very friendly and made sure everyone was comfortable. The hardest part of the job is remembering cash register rules, and the most enjoyable was just the aura of the store."
good,"Very relaxed and easy going workplace. Plenty of jobs to do when busy, with customer service being main priority. A friendly and welcoming envirment to work in."
good,i really enjoyed working at this place and would refer anyone.. If u have a flexible schedule then it is definitely the job for you.. Great job if you lo0ve shopping and interacting with customers
good,"Would love to return and work for them again. Personal matter attended me to leave but I would most definitely return to work for urban. "
good,"Urban Outfitters is a great company to work for. They often check in with employees to communicate the employee's goals, should they wish to specialize in a skill within the company."
good,"working at urban was a really interesting experience, it was during holidays so the work was a little bit more fast paced but managers are pleasant and coworkers are always looking out for each other."
good,Fun place to work. Great discounts on merchandise and clothes. I loved meeting new people and working with colleagues that turned into long friends...
good,"I don't have many things to say about UO. The management at my location is bias.They pick favourites, and then let the others have the lesser jobs. Not very organized."
good,"really cool fun store to work in. styling for all types of people. from hipsters to the hip hop culture, all people can find items they would like from this store."
good,It was a very great place to work i really enjoyed working with my team there i loved talking to new people and placing orders and just interacting with one another

good,Working at Urban Outfitters has been an overall great experience for me. I am learning more about myself and the kind of person I want to become and develop with the company
good,great place to shop or simply just vibe out. great environment friendly staff. trendy atmosphere. Inexpensive apparel.
good,My old store was cool and fun with an awesome staff. My new store that is 15 years old is very odd to me.
good,"A typical day at work for me is normally working the morning, so I have my coffee by my side. Once the day starts moving I can feel the coffee kicking in."
good,"Fast paced, large staff and high volume retailer. artistic and eclectic staff members and district team. I learned everything from the ground up. Beginning with sales associate to receiving to display artist ending in a management position with awesome benefits and quarterly bonus incentives."
good,"I get to work with wonderful employees who I am proud to now call my friends. Working at Urban Outfitters has taught me valuable customer service skills. The Management team is amazing, they are completely understanding of every situation and they approach every issue without any bias."
good,Pay is low and there is no room for advancement but the employee discount rocks.
good,A typical day at Urban Outfitters started off with a team meeting every morning. I learnt many new skills during my time at urban such as picking a packing items correctly. There where no hard parts to the job. Most enjoyable part of the day was the afternoon

good,"Great atmosphere and people."
good,Fun filled work environment at a slow but steady pace. No major complaints other than having college students as unexperienced supervisors with lack of an actual training department.
good,"I loved working for Urban. Everything was ever changing and everyone was supportive. I felt like Urban, as a company, is above the rest as far as standards.  I Hope Urban will continue to nourish individuals and provide life long connections because I know I've met some amazing people there. Including my husband."
good,Good for college students who need a part time retail job. Met great people and learned a lot about customer service. Fun and lax work environment with unique individuals who are all usually striving creatives.
good,I’m this work place I would be asking customers about there interest on buying products and try to help them find what they are looking for I was able to resolve complaints and have each customer leave happy. The hardest part about this job was dealing with rude customers although I had a smile on my face. But the most enjoyable part of this job was being able to see a customer leave satisfied:
good,Great place to work. Probably my favorite part-time job I've had. Every day is generally different from each other and management really cared about my life outside of work. Never had any cranky customers and it's a joy to come into work everyday.
good,Very nice place to work!  Teams is very efficient. Management is nice. Most enjoyable part of my job is the customers.  Also the work hours are very nice.
good,"The location of the HQ was on a renovated Navy base, I was required to drive 4 other employees to the site on HQ every day. We worked in a different place on HQ every day. Moving mirrors, clothing, furniture, and other house hold items to be displayed in sets."
good,Great place to work. For the most part laid back but there are really busy seasons where you have the opportunity for overtime. Many training opportunities.

good,"Collaborating with Urban Outfitters to style products, create outfits and have them featured onto my fashion blog and the Urban Outfitters Europe online blog to inspire others. Its a great experience working with like minded individuals."
good,"UO is, by far, the best retail company that I have ever had the pleasure to work for. The company has spent years on improving their technique for customer service and how to make sure that the customer is always happy. Every single soul, from the bottom of the chain to very tip-top, is filled with positive energy and their own unique quirks. I can always count on management to help out with anything that's bothering me and know that they truly mean well. The hardest part of my job would have to be resisting the urge to compulsively buy a new outfit. That's it. I have no real complaints about working here and that, in itself, is the most enjoyable part."
good,"Everyone was always ""on brand"" as far as fashion is concerned. your colleagues are great free spirited and hard working people who also enjoy having fun at work."
good,This job is great if you love being your self this is the job for you .

Love working with my co-workers and management because we worked as a team. The hardest part was during Black Friday, it was so hard to keep the floor neat because of the high traffic. I love working the store because I am a people person and fashion lover. "
good,Loved working there during my time in college.

The management at urban is awesome they are there if you need them. Work place you work around a lot of nice different cultured people and the work place is always clean.

The most enjoyable part of the job place is if your are in a bad mood you go straight back to your truck and they will come check in on you once in a while

good,It was a blessing to work there. I would not trade it for the word. I miss the kids. I  hope they are doing great. They should be fine.
good,"Although this job could be summarized as folding clothes, hanging clothes, and running around a store to keep it organized, it is so much more. It's a place where people love to shop and we as employees love to help people find exactly what they are looking for. This job has given me experience in clothing store retail, store set-up, loss prevention, extensive customer assistance and working with MPOS systems. "

good,"Working for Urban Outfitters is awesome. The management is understanding and the staff as a whole is like one big family. Management is easy to talk to and the environment feels safe. I love working with my coworkers to complete projects or help customers to our fullest abilities. Although we have recently been hiring more employees, we all still work as a team and it is fun getting to meet new people and help train them to be wonderful sales associates. On a day-to-day basis I tend to spend most of my time at the register, checking people out and helping them order items we no longer have in store. The hardest part about working here is always being on top of having exemplary customer service skills, our customers want personal-shopper style customer service. During the holiday season, things get a little bit hectic, but at the end of the day seeing the sales we made that day makes it worth it."
good,"Working for Urban Outfitters in Calgary was one of the best experiences I've had at any job. Everyone worked together well, and were extremely nice. Urban Outfitters encourages the idea of Peers Teaching Peers which allowed an open and professional communication line between the managers, team leaders, and sales associate."

good,"The staff I work with are so full of life. I am already an energetic person, so to have others around me that reciprocate my energy is fun. Everybody get along which mean there is little to zero problems between us co-workers. To me, the hardest part of the job is being on your feet. But since we are constantly moving around, I sometime don't notice until I get home."
good,Urban Outfitters was a very fun job to work where I was always busy and had something to do. I enjoyed helping customers with selections. The people were fun to work with and management always guided you in the right direction.
good,"A typical day at URBN would consist of taking part/working with fellow co-workers in almost if not every aspect and area of the store."

good,"Great place to work. Very relaxed atmosphere, casual dress code"

The benefits are fab (60% off on three items a month, 40% on other clothing items, 25% on houseware, but 40% off during Employee Appreciation). The staff is extremely amicable. Management is considerate. Knock on wood, but I really have enjoyed my time at Urban so far."

good,"I love working at Urban. Working at the store makes me happy. The staff is awesome. I just love the overall vibes that Urban gives. The only problem with Urban (at least in the store I work at) is that they only give you like 8 hours per week to work because our hours depend on how much the store sells. I have another job so that I can pay my bills, but I wish I could work full time at Urban because I love working there."
good,"what not a lot of people know about working at an urban outfitters would be the fact that there are different store volumes, which makes it a different experience from place to place. "
good,"Fun, cool and trendy place to work. Met many different characters and got to experience working in London. Learned how to build customer relationship skills and how retail structure is organised."
good,"Great company, it encourages self-expression, takes your opinion into consideration, and understands that you are part of their business. Also, their events are great and you get to learn a great deal about sales."
good,"Very fun people to work with"

good,Urban Outfitters was a great place to work because the environment was fun and the staff was great. Management was able to appropriately manage employees while also having a good time.
good,The most desirable work place with great team members all striving for the same goal. Teaching up-selling and how to offer exceptional customer service. Supportive management team that makes work enjoyable. Decent amount of restrictions and regulations to follow for such a thriving company. Hardest part of the job competitive hours and pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was gaining the respect and admiration at what you were good at!

good,"This place is truly a hidden gem. Management genuinely care about their associates. They're understanding and they're really flexible whether it's part-time or full-time work, Part time is really scarce on hours this time of the year but it is just a part-time job. Pay varies by location so that's something that depends on where you are. Advancement in the company at this specific location is easy as long as you're committed to your job and willing to do the job. I love it. Plus the discount is awesome :)"

For me, I was and am always excited to go to work and see who I am working with that day. The managers are great and you get to know everyone very well so it seems more like a hangout spot then it does work. I learned a lot about customer service and helping people out. I also made a ton of great relationships with customers throughout the three years that I believe will last forever."

good,"Working in UO is a great experience. You are constantly broadening your creative side, the company encourages its employees to reveal their skills, to express themselves, welcomes people who differ from the crowd and are unique and creative. The working day is considerably busy but very enjoyable since your are surrounded by friendly, diverse and open-minded people who make you feel like home."
good,Urban Outfitters I loved because it was still customer service but a different atmosphere and culture which I loved. it was like a Hot Topic kind of store but less dark and more quirky.
good,I learned many skills that will help me with other retail jobs. I learned how to properly interact with customers and learned out to push products onto customers without being too forward. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I am able to help a customer find what they want (rewarding feeling).
good,The work life balance is perfect. Corp. headquarters is located on an amazing campus that can stir anyone's creative side.

good,fashion store different people coworkers fun hard work pays off 8 hours a day the hardest part was getting a raise I learned a lot how to do stock and also where the clothin comes from
good,"My review , I over all love the job, i love the enviornment, i love the manager, I was a huge fan of the location. Ive learned a lot of the departments! Ive learned how to handle situations that i never would have encounters."
good,"I have only been with this company for a short period of time however I am thoroughly enjoying the job thus far. During a typical day at work I will be assigned a location on the shop floor to keep tidy and deal with customers, the location changes throughout the day. All members of staff have been warm and welcoming and the managers are on the ball and good at giving clear direction. I do not find this job difficult as I have worked in retail for a number of years already. The most enjoyable part of the job is making a connection with customers and getting to know fellow members of staff and management."
good,"Every body  friendly was very friendly."
good,"I love it there! My coworkers are like family and its always fun to be there. We all do our job but sometimes it doesn't even feel like work, you know?"

I was able to excel into other positions and gain strengths and be apart of the management and making our store run more smoothly and perform great customer service to our guest by being prompt working together and making new concepts as a group,small projects in and around the store. Working along other employees to learn or help enhance a certain task to simplify the store or a product at that time."
good,"This clothing company was by far my favorite work place. A typical day would be to clock in, start folding clothes and making sure the store is organized. Meeting and greeting customers at the door, and working in the fitting rooms. The management team here was absolutely awesome. I loved every moment I had working at this job. However, my commute was too far of a drive."
good,"I answered incoming emails for customers regarding their accounts, orders, placing orders and product information. In working for this company we had 5 company's that we handled customer service inquiries for. I also answered incoming customer service calls for customer inquiries. This job was fast paced and very multitasking. The management team was wonderful and always very helpful. The environment was very upbeat and I loved working for the company."
good,A typical day at work was pretty fun. I learned a lot about life and my own culture from my employees. I also learned a lot of different things about shipping things off and how it can take so long sometimes. The managers were nice and laid back and the coworkers were friendly. The hardest part of the job at first was all of the walking but then I got used to it and it was all a breeze.
good,My absolute favorite job. It is like a huge family and i love that feeling.
good,"I learned how to feel more comfortable speaking with customers, as well as greeting people at the door, helping them with the item they were looking for. Also helping and organizing the fitting room, women's department, and sales department."
good,i scanned items to be shipped out.
good,Flexible with scheduling. Easy to pick up hours. Pay isn't the best but it is a retail job. Love the environment and coworkers. The discount is very generous.
good,"Worked at Urban Outfitters for three years and it was the best work experience I have had. The management team looks out for you, everyone is friendly and drama free. They give you the opportunity to learn more things rather than just on the floor duties. Gives you the opportunity to grow."

good,"I’ve worked at two different locations at Urban Outfitters and I loved both dearly. My coworkers at both locations have been close like a family, with a lot of us forming strong friendships outside of the work environment. Management has been endlessly kind, understanding, and helpful. When I was very sick recently, they immediately began working with me to make sure my schedule was as ideal as possible. I love this company and its people."
good,"It could be from my lack of extensive warehouse experience, but from the short time i had working for Urban, i found my self everyday being able to look around the warehouse and find something new to appreciate. Very large, tidy work-space combined with mind stimulating, and physically demanding work honestly made me feel like going into work was more than just another paycheck."
good,I worked in places that were cutthroat. Like the Dept of corrections.  And now meeting people that are wonderful is a blessing.  And think its a great environment. The work is fast paced. But I love that. God made me that way
good,It's a good place to work. You'll meet plenty of the other staff members and make friends. The fast pace environment at times can be stressful but it definetly isn't boring

good,"My typical day at work consisted of interacting with and assisting customers. Urban Outfitters has a great leadership program being that they train the employees to be helpful to other co-workers and eventually lead them to rise within the company. Urban Outfitters will definitely teach you the meaning of teamwork and how to make things work as a team. Another thing is that the company focuses on the customer first, so that teaches customer service at first hand experience. There weren't any parts of the job that were very hard for me to grasp just because I'm a quick learner. The thing that I loved most about working at Urban Outfitters was interacting with the customers. I enjoyed that the absolute most. "
good,great company
good,I enjoyed working for the University of South Carolina. There was always something new and exciting going on at the campus. I enjoyed the retailing aspect and my normal duties as the textbook buyer and store manager. Interacting with students and faculty.
good,Overall Urban Outfitters is a great company. I would continue working there but the job was only seasonal. As a previous employee we greeted and assist customers properly. The store was very organized. We accomplished many goals that were set and my team was always there to catch and prevent shoplifting.

good,"I see a lot of negative posts about the point system with the company. The system is there for a reason. If you abuse it, you lose it. The points are there for when you need them. Also, YOU are in control of your schedule. There is plenty of room for advancement. If you excel and show that you care about your job, upper management notices. Nothing worth while is given, it is earned!!!"

good,The work culture is very relaxed. Obviously as a retail employee you get the occasional bad customer but overall the store is enjoyable to work at and I would recommend it.

good,"My bosses and coworkers were all cool, you could wear whatever you wanted for the most part: they wanted diversity, not 20 people all wearing the same clothes talking and acting the same way. Have to fold a lot of T shirts, be prepared for that but its fun when you're doing it with your coworkers with music on in the store."

I loved my co-workers we had fun times and never any altercations. There was no hard part about the job. The most enjoyable time of the job was black friday there was so many customers and thats what made it such a thrill. Our theme was bikers and it was interesting to see how each employee participated.
