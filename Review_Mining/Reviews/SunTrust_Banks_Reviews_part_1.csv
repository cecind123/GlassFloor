bad,"I would not recommend anyone working for Suntrust. It's a very cut throat environment. Very unfriendly; they do not live up to their objective goals. "
bad,"Management is terrible. They pretend to care about the client, but only want you to become a pushy salesman.  Been in financial services for 20 years and can say this is the worst company I ever worked."
bad,"Gave it one star because I could’ve give it none. Terrible management. They don’t listen to you, pay is awful, too much stress. SunTrust cares more about selling products then really helping customers"
bad,We were often there 3 to 4 hours after we closed.. a hour or 2 before we opened to make up for the lack of staff in our location. The location wax a HEAVY traffic area. Not to mention we had mice running over the building.
bad,Bad company to work for... Cares nothing about the employees. Company cares more about getting numbers than the clients or employees. The pay is decent but not enough for the things you have to go through with!
bad,SunTrust Bank is still with the equipments and process that was in the 1980s ! Not just in regards to equipment but also their process and the employee relationship!
bad,"This job asks you to work long hours, do things outside of your job description, and pushes you beyond your limits. I was there 2 years and after transferring to the Dunkirk branch from Prince Frederick branch for full time hours, I experienced less than desirable work conditions. At one point there were only 2 people in the entire branch working. Me running the entire teller side and another woman running the desk side. Customers can be mean if you haven't worked there since its opened so they don't trust you, and the get impatient waiting forever to deposit a check."
bad,Terrible experience the company couldn't keep employees too many client complaints not enough staff for the amount of business that was walking through the door too many complaints about the company
bad,Commitment To Team Is Terrible. Company will always put it self first above all others. Will work you like a slave with no lunches. And management is terrified so they scare their underlings as well.
bad,"This bank was not in a positive situation when I was hired. In several company wide meetings held each week, so many disgruntled employees expressed negative concerns and frustration at these concerns not being resolved. I felt the problems had been ongoing for several years and that I decided not to continue with the company for this reason."
bad,"The time I worked for SunTrust was not a good experience, I was not  respected for my skills, and experienced racial prejudice from some of my management team. The Project had a lot of turnover, and the management did not have a clear process for delivery.  I  found that management was not sure what to do about the potential fit for new hires, and was really scattered and dysfunctional with the requirements for delivery."
bad,Worked at Suntrust for a year and a half. The culture wasn't great. Hopefully things improve since they merged with BB&T bank. BB&T bank was a great company to work for.
bad,"Most departments in Suntrust allow you to make up for time not on the clock throughout that week. Example, like doctor appointment, childs afterschool event or illness emergency.  Many that work here who have been in a car accident or gone to the the hospital for an emergency come back and are treated like liars.  A doctors note does not excuse you so you don't even need to obtain one.  Time can not be made up and it affects your attendance and occurrences which is the number one reason for loss of employees in work area. "
bad,"I would not work for this company everything is half backwards not to mention there is not proper consistent policy and procedures. Management does not care for you they only care about numbers not about the overwhelming position they put you in based on location, teammates and past management. Health insurance sucks I never paid so much for a family of three in all the years I worked. Turn over is crazy everyone leaves."
bad,"Very rigid rules and one horrible  and unprofessional, rude, aggressive supervisor in fraud that they wont reprimand or fire."
bad,"fast, not enough staff, not enough pay, manager was brought in and the staff had to train her.  Very numbers based.  Did learn how bank procedures and safety"
bad,Cancelled my interview while I was driving to the interview at Laurel Lakes branch. The reason was that the manager just got back from vacation and could not interview anyone.
bad,"The company focuses only on sales, leaving employees on the operation side to suffer, work long hours for little pay, and be held accountable for every little thing that goes wrong, regardless of if it is their responsibility/fault or not. Operations employees are disregarded, disrespected, and treated as easily replaceable on a daily basis. Management does not back their employees, and when asked for advice on how to improve the moral or the efficiency of the office, completely disregards it."
bad,should shut down it is a kissing behind type of job and if you love that smell on your lips and don't mind getting treated like an machine and then please go work for them
bad,"My experience at SunTrust was brief but not quite brief enough. The schedules were terrible, the management put too much importance on things that really didn't seem relevant and the pay was horrid. I think it's a good stepping stone for someone just starting their career in corporate America but anyone with a few years experience should steer clear."
bad,"SunTrust is more concerned about sales than clients or employees, the longer you are there the more they look for ways to let you go to hire lower salary employees"
bad,This place is a mess. They have the reorgs and people end up losing their jobs for no reason other than upper management needed a reorg but upper management never loses their jobs just the people who actually do the work.
bad,Suntrust is not for its employees  They did an reduction in force and got rid of long term employees. Suntrust is all about the numbers and not taking care of their employees.
bad,Toxic work culture and bad management. It's like working with zombies. No mentorship. Deployments were a nightmare. Certain team members had anti-social personalities. The IT managers don't have business degrees. They're just Senior Devs with extra responsibility.
bad,"I worked for SunTrust for almost 20 years. It used to be a great place to have a long, stable career. But in recent years, the bank hired a large number of middle managers from outside the company. Essentially, they are trying to get rid of all of the older people and replace them with younger people. These new middle managers ruined the culture and drove most of the good people out of the organization."
bad,Suntrust just lay-off over 100 + employees with our no remorse left families to find for themselves. Wish is not fair to those families. Suntrust is not a good place to work
bad,"Unethical expectations, expected sales over customer experience, poor management, "
bad,"there was a high turnover rate within the company, making job security unsure."
bad,This company will use you up until your burned out and broken. Avoid at all cost they are total users of employees. Thank you. I was bruised as far as emotionally.
bad,I enjoyed getting to know our clients and understanding the role I played as a bank teller. For the most part it was pretty easy; mostly listening to each customer and try to understand how to better service them.
bad,Long hours sometimes with no lunches. short staffed not enough people to run a branch efficiently. Management micromanages every aspect  of daily routine.
bad,Very stressful workplace. And there policy and procedures are a joke. I know now why they have such a high turnover rate. I would not recommend for anyone to work there.
bad,"Not enjoyable.  typical corproation that looks out for itself.  Not flexible nor willing to work with employees.  wife had baby, had to be back at work in a week."
bad,"If you have never worked for a bank before, and adore micro-management, Suntrust has exciting career opportunities for you.  Relax your mind, your thinking will be done for you."
bad,If you notice all of the openings at Sun Trust that should be the warning that it isn't the place to work. Horrible work/life balance and no advancement not worth it.
bad,They fired me bc I borrowed $5 from a customer for lunch. I forgot that you couldn't take any money from any customers. My manager was there and sitting there while watching me take the money and didn't say a word. He waited 2 days before firing me.
bad,"Senior Management team was not supportive.  Every single one of the manager look out for their own benefits. They did not care for the employees."
bad,I only worked here 9 months. Did not like to sell stuff to customers. All they wanted was to cash their check and go but management wanted us to upscale them.
bad,"Teammates worked well together and faced many changes with management. In this company wasn't fully able to make decisions own your own, coaching was done but no actions were taken when needed"
bad,"new management change the way things were conducted. In which, this pose a problem a lot of things were put in place which showed a lot of favoritism."
bad,Suntrust is strictly political . The managers even up to svp are one sided if there is a issue with management. half the company is out on medical leave for stress if they aren't already part of the dozens of layoffs they have every year. This was once a good company to work for but  I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.
bad,"Poor upper management structure, company has has no long term goal or sight, goals and objectives change often depending on what the company is trying to obtain at that time. Incentive plan can change in the middle of the quarter without and prior notice and company expects you to achieve goals based on a plan that was just implemented."
bad,SunTrust Mortgage is outsourcing 90% of jobs to India. Lay offs since Sept 2018 and continuing. The upper management and senior leaders are not transparent and expect the teammate to be dishonest about results.
bad,I was fired for the color of my skin. Not giving away my race but my manager and i were let go after increasing the sales in that location by more than 40% in less than 3 months due to our sales experience.
bad,"I felt like robot at this place. The higher-ups in the business never appreciated their staff. Working conditions were repetitive in nature. Trying to get days off was a mission in of its self. terrible place to work, or at least the department I worked for was."
bad,"No defined structure, their vision is waffling.  Upper management is lacking the appropriate training,  Sales driven with no technology.  Intently focus on sales and the incentive plan is poor."
bad,"New management promoted at SunTrust Mortgage continuously told us in town hall meetings and in emails that employees were NOT the company's greatest asset - Employees are ""our greatest expense"".  Thus, they released hundreds of employees over the last 15 months.  Maybe I have the wrong perspective, but I believe if the bottom line is shrinking, management should have been creative with tools to assist sales to increase production.  Instead they chose to eliminate people because the ""people"" are too expensive.  Sad."
bad,Please look for a job some where else this place make employee do unethical job....It's more like a call center All day call and call then sale to clients and very pushy. If you cant get sale they will make you feel terrible
bad,"While working at Sun Trust, I found it to be an eye opening experience the people are all for themselves.  The manager would say one thing and not support it later on."
bad,"very poor management; you are a slave and your personal life doesn't matter. No job security and benefits is not the best."
bad,"SunTrust hired me as a full-time teller but instead, it is a full-time sales position with all the responsibilities of teller work completely taken for granted. All my manager and teller coordinator care about are the sales and referrals. It is constant stress and hints that I can lose my job if I don't make my quotas for referrals to bankers. There is never any recognition for meeting any requirements as a teller. I could be the best teller that all the clients love, but it would not matter if I did was not a good salesperson getting the bank new deposits...nothing else matters whatsoever. I have been successful getting referrals but yet every day is a new day for more stress and being pushed with my teller coordinator on us all day about what we say to clients, how we say it, and why are we not as great as she is. I have seen female bankers brought to tears as well as tellers due to the stress from the manager and the teller coordinator. Grown men who are bankers have been yelled at for the most trivial things with no regard for their hard work. Clients who have money are treated with great regard while clients without are ignored. My work environment is the most stressful place I have ever worked in my life. I have have never worked where my manager and my teller coordinator actually spy on me and the other tellers listening to every single word we say. When district managers come to visit, we are told that they will be listening to us too and we better say the right things or else. I hope to find another job as soon as possible. There is a lot of turnover there and the reason"
bad,worse place ever to work they don't care about you as an employee or as a client all they want you to do is sell or purchase their product. You are pushed to sell to keep your job. They want the public to think that they care only about your  financial well being but behind closed doors it's all about the sale. They are just as bad as Well Fargo and should be investigated the same as Wells Fargo was.
bad,"In almost 2 years didn't earn a payout.  Goals unrealistic. They eased up after the Wells Fargo mess, however have come back with a vengeance.  ALL branch locations should not be considered equal.  One minute its all about ""helping"" the client, the next it sales, sales, sales, quota, quota, quota."
bad,"This company is a disaster for any financial advisor.  Top levels of management are utterly incompetent, you will drown in bad computer systems, busywork, clerical work, secretarial work, and you will never get a chance to actually produce or manage portfolios.  Do not join this company."
bad,"I worked at this company for 10+ years. When I first started (2007), I loved it. It was a great company, but then they changed. Managers are micromanaged and required to micromanage their staff. Senior Management comes and requires managers to stand behind tellers until they get a walk over referral. If they do not do it on the first interaction, then the manager steps in to demonstrate. That goes on and on until each teller is successful with senior leadership watching. I had no problem doing this when leadership wasn't around, but I did not like the fact that they did this to the tellers, but the tellers would be nervous because of them. On top of this, we were required to have 5 business appointments (new prospects) a week. We were also required to contact 25 customers daily for sales calls. By contact, that means to physically speak to someone for a sales call. In addition, we had to have 5 pre-set appointments daily. This is also the case for PB's. It didn't matter that we consistently hit goal, all this was still required or else you were considered unsuccessful. The goals are ridiculous. Luckily, we hit goal consistently, but it is because my team worked hard and knew people who gave us great referrals. Even though I was successful at this institution I would never recommend it to anyone unless they are desperate. We had four different area managers in one year. They don't promote from within. I was consistently ranked as a top performer in the company and never made it past manager. For any positions above manager, they want someone from another bank who can bring a"
bad,SunTrust was a good place to work until they changed the mortgage division.   I was happy working at SunTrust when I was in the Subject Matter Expert role.  I traveled the company and trained employees.
bad,"There is no proper training, you extremely micromanaged all day!! No real coaching just someone telling all you are doing wrong! Do not waste your time!"
bad,"Would not recommend, not a good work environment. Thoroughly check out all the reviews before working at this company. I did take away any new skill sets from this job."
bad,Very cut throat environment. Some racial harassment. Does not care about employees or customers. Very sell oriented and lacks focus on work life balance.
bad,"don't work there, seriously go somewhere else, the place is horrible and there is no advancement .........................................................."
bad,Over-staffed department resulted in very little to do and eventual lay-offs.  Poor management and very little new-hire training was provided.  I do not recommend.
bad,"I recently left SunTrust Mortgage and couldn't be any happier. SunTrust Mortgage closed my office in Annandale ,Va and made the complete Operations team relocate to Rockville, MD. They gave us less than 30 days notice of relocation and did NOT offer an severance for the employees that could not make the relocation.  They said due to the business they were not able to uphold the lease in the building in Virginia and made us move by November 1st. We later on found out that the lease wasn't up until May 2018 but they required us to move by November 1st. During my 30 days time in the Rockville Office they fired 4 employees to continue their downsizing.  I would NOT recommend working for SunTrust. If you decide to don't say I didn't warn you."
bad,"The place was not very organize and we had so many issues with management. Pay was very low and never good communication."
bad,"it is a good place to start in the banking business but they will tell you that they care about people but they are like wells fargo  all they care about you is about selling and selling or opening accounts and process loans as much if not you get fired, they will tell you that if customer don't need the product don't offer but they will write you up for not having the goal products you need per day. other than that they will pay you good, but its defenetely bad management they dont hire people with degrees and you can lie they dont even check if you have a diploma or GED"
bad,"The typical day is very busy you cant converse with colleagues, and train is very brief. Management is rude and do not care to work with employees. They company has a very high turnover rate."
bad,Upper management not in tuned with workforce.  overworked  under paid.  stress is the norm  long work days muitl conference calls at all hours of day to tell you what your not doing even though you are considered a top producer.
bad,"No job security, poor management and HR, not enough time to complete immense work the give and pay is low for what is actually being done. They like to hire and fire."
bad,Crazy hours poor management and communication good training poor benefits low pay. lack of carrier advancement is who you know no what you know and how good you are.
bad,"Only a part-time job while I was working for Impex. No advantages or benefits. Very stressful, unhealthy work culture.  The company doesn't care much about their employees' safety nor advancement."
bad,You will only advance if you're a managers favorite.  There are  no programs for job advancement.  They're perfectly fine with you working in the same position for 10yrs or more with no encouragement to advance.
bad,Mismanaged and just a poor work culture all around. Our branch went through three managers in the time that that I was working there. Would not recommend working here.
bad,Very prestigious and  productive company to work for. Suntrust always provided ways to help their employees with their personal finances. I really enjoyed helping helping the students for the volunteer program with JA Financial.
bad,The bank operates on a skeleton crew and expects one teller to handle all branch walk in clients and 2 drive through lanes. Does not offer extensive training and does not offer any additional training. Management pushes and requires tellers to script to every client to get referrals for new accounts
bad,"Want you to sell, banking shouldn't be about selling it should be about helping clients to get financially stable. Wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy. Its a reason why their locations are shut down."
bad,Understaffed and uncaring for employees want to progress. They ask that you perform but make sure you are overwhelmed. Employees just keep leaving. Changes for the worst.
bad,"All they care about is their bottom line. No enjoyment at this company at all. They make advancement promises, but never follow up. This was the absolute worst."
bad,"I enjoy working with my teams as a Float Teller, but their is a lack of talent in their management team! Unorganized, unprofessional, and down right hateful. If you like pressuring your clients for products that they do not need whatsoever in the name of a sale, then this is the job for you! Please take any other job! This job is NOT worth the pay, aggravation, and your sanity. ANY job would be much more professional and would treat you better!"
bad,Pay was unfair.  Tenor employees making less with more knowledge then new employees. Unrealistic sales goals.   No support from management just push push push.  Horrible hours.   Extensive training
bad,"Business slowed down beginning of year everyone is having a hard time getting applications leads are horrible and being recycled."
bad,Poor management. Turnover is high.  If you reach out to HR to voice issues within the branch they quickly defend management and allow management to know so then they have it out for employee.
bad,"Lack of training "
bad,Suntrust is very robotic. All they care about are the numbers. They make it look like they care about the customers but in reality you must meet their very hefty sales goals
bad,"Poor work environment. Management is terrible and so are there policies. Always pushing you to sell, sell, sell. I work at a bank not a retail place. l"
bad,"The days are long, sometimes 9 - 7:30, Saturdays 8 - 6:30.  The hardest part of the job management doesn't care about their people.  They tell you, you can earn incentive but change the program constantly so no one can make money."
bad,"No work life balance "
bad,Suntrust bank just as bad as xerox sorry management. After 34 years. Sorry leads picked on me to. I would never work there again neither sorryyyttttttf
bad,"SunTrust creates great value/benefits for their clients yet, provide nothing to their employees.  You do not get breaks, highly underpaid and no recognition for your efforts unless you make a major sale.  The main this they misrepresent the job.  THIS IS A SALES POSITION."
bad,"It has been years since I worked there but when I was there I felt very unappreciated.  "
bad,The worst place to work for. Working Under a lot of pressure is not healthy. Suntrust do not care about their employees. They want you to meet crazy goals. Save your time and dont apply
bad,"Top- performing professional with over 10 years progressive experience in banking and finance, seeking to take next career step in banking as a branch manager. Expertise in managing personal, corporate, and small business accounts, and building long-term relationships with customers. Accomplished in selling banking solutions to drive sales and revenue by delivering unparalleled value and outstanding service."
bad,"Suntrust does not treat front-line employees well. It has very high turnover and poor job stability. Suntrust creates a very taxing work environment by, among other things, being so understaffed that employees don't get to take lunch breaks or bathroom breaks. Retail schedules often require 6 -day work weeks (in order to cover Saturdays), leaving only 1 day to spend with family and run errands.. Part time employees are required to show up for a meeting in the morning, wait 4 hours, come back and then start a shift.  Long-time employees are let go at a whim. And employees often have to work miles from home, even when a branch is located around the corner from where they live.  Suntrust is a wasteful and inefficient company that does not care for, nor show loyalty to its employees. Long-time retail employees are fired if they don't meet unrealistic sales goals."
bad,"worst place to work, no honesty culture, poor management, no honesty between managers and employees, the most enjoyable part of the job is that it was close to my house"
bad,"Management is horrible"
bad,They paid really low for what they have you doing. They threaten your job if you didn't get enough referrals. I would do the drive thru and many other functions.
bad,Worst job I ever had. Management is horrible because it is privately own. No room for advancement . No benefits of any kind.
bad,"There is no future with this company. They don't promote within. They rather hire from the outside. Branch managers and recruiters ignore your phone calls and emails after you interview for positions.  So you dont know if you are hired or not. So if you are a current employee in the branches, don't waste your time applying for jobs. You will only get it if someone likes you.  They don't care about work life balance or if you have a long commute to work. Overall Suntrust is not a good bank to work for if you are looking for somewhere to grow."
bad,Suntrust does NOT care about their employees as someone who was new to banking I had minimal on the job training.  Yea they have in class training which I breezed through with flying colors.  They also have outrageous goals to meet.  If you aren't doing anything shady they are impossible to meet. If you don't meet your goals you get fired.  I got out of there as fast as possible.  The corporate company cares about one thing.. MONEY.. and if you aren't performing they could care less about your job.  The benefits were great but no real structure in the branches.  Of course when sales are so high customer service goes to out the window which unfortunately has happened with SunTrust.  I had a banker who made almost triple my salary and we both had the same goals if that tells you anything.  Corporate does not care about their employees at all.
bad,I worked there 32 years they made up incentive manipulation to get rid of me which was 100 percent not the truth and I was a top performer my entire career .. They do not deserve hard working good employees . Definitely not a place for a career minded employee
bad,"Management is all commission driven. Everything is about making money, not what is best for the client. Money Hungry. The employee turn over is extremely high."
bad,"I am not the best person to give a description of what I think of this company because it has been a long time since I have worked here. I am sure things have slightly changed from the time that I was there. However, I think SunTrust is a good bank for customers but they treat their employees poorly. The pay was bad and management was confrontational and not professional. I couldn’t trust anyone I worked with and I hated going to work. I honestly can’t think about one pro from working here."
bad,terrible place to work...Not enough training 2 days for teller side & not too much for loan.kjflkjaklsjdlkjdskljflasdjfklsdjljflasjdfkljljsa
bad,"Everyone worried about their position, branch closures, cutbacks, etc. Not a very pleasant atmosphere, nor was it conducive to creative thinking."
bad,The co workers I got along with and the management staff was there to provide support at all times.  I took inbound customer service calls for a bank.  The calls ranged from balance inquiries to ordering checks.  The most enjoyable part of this job was helping customers
bad,"Unprofessional and not up to part organization, Worst place I have worked for thus far. management is unprofessional and has no knowledge of lending and etc"
bad,"poor employees, poor culture, poor management, walk around aisles and harass customers into getting accounts, knowledge of the employees was terrible"
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone.  They do not care about their employees or there clients.  SunTrust is all about what can you do for the company.
bad,Nothing is ever good enough for this company.  It is a widget counting company that changes goals all the time so you cant make bonuses.  They just want to work you to death and expect you to work three peoples jobs and still make unattainable goals.
bad,Suntrust is very sales driven. The manager at the Greenbriar location has mistreated and disrespected all of her employees and many customers. HR has been called numerous times and nothing has been done... Terrible pay only twice a month and they show favoritism.  Complete bad experience. I highly recommend you not apply here.
bad,"Typical day at Suntrust Bank, on the operations side was anything but fun!! Stressful, unrealistic sales goals, high turn over. It got so bad to point the managers would no longer spoke to the employees. The entire FRAUD  depart was laid off  and doubled the work load for thr  credit card  department with no raise and to add insult to injury $100.00 a month for parking . Not to mention if you were eligible for incentive and left the company THEY WOULDN'T PAY YOU even if you had earned it..."
bad,"This was the worse career move I've ever made. It's sad to say but I would never apply for a loan from this place. Micromanagement I an understatement and the micro managers are cluess as to what the loan process is and can't offer much assistance much less close a loan. Turnover extremely high. In the last week about 7 people left. Medical benefits are a joke $35 for PCP $50 for specialist and RX are barely covered. Only 2 weeks of vacation, 1 week of sick and they still assign work when you out of work. There is no option to buy a week. Lack of respect from management. They have no spine or common sense. No accountability is required everything is closings fault and the managers don't stand up for you. Almost everyone is new, 6 months or less and the training is poor and it shows in the work. The pay doesnt match what's required and neither does the job description."
bad,Management was not helpful.... 6 day work week for part-time .... don't complain or you will be told if you don't like it find something else... management cursed at me.   not expectable
bad,Liars.. tell you it is customer service then it turns out to be high pressure and sales. always threatening you with your job if you don't sell.
bad,I worked for this company for almost five years. I have been in banking for almost 20 years. Suntrust talks about customer focus and team work when really all they care about is SALES! Upper management only cares about the numbers and  does not care how you get them as long as you get them. This is a very stressful work place and no room for skill based advancement ( all about who you know)! They have people in management positions that should not even be trusted to manage a check book. There Security/Fraud Rep who covers the Orlando/Lake County markets is just clueless!
bad,Learned a lot from the company but its only a college working job.  co-workers and manager were cool but the upper management was horrible. I would only recommend for a short period of time to get a pay check
bad,"Poor compensation, benefits, and job culture.  No job security as jobs are eliminated prior to establishing new processes.  No management skills.  Training is provided by job aids.  Annual raises are less than three percent."
bad,"Difficult place to work. Limited opportunities. Advancement is tough to come by, both upward and lateral movements are few and far between."
bad,Things are always changing.  You never know when you will be laid off.  So you just do the best job you can until that time comes.
bad,"Worked for this company for 13 years. Built up a cliental base of loyal clients with assets of over 100,000 k plus. Also built up  the working class clients through the community of which I live in. Upper management only worried about numbers, do not care if you are with a client and not on not on the daily manager calls, will email you to get on call, and get rid of the client. What ever happened too we care about the client? Oh the the motto "" How can we let you shine today?/"" give it up. The area mgr for Brevard county does not care about clients, personnel, only the numbers, and if you are not making your numbers he does not help you to achieve them, only ridicules you on how you are going to get them. 10 top Branch Mangers with many years of with SunTrust have left or been fired by this insensitive person due to his actions."
bad,they don't care about your growth. all they care about is the numbers
bad,Manager said leave your problems at the door and she did the opposite. She brought her problems to work. She yelled at us and did not say many things positive of our performance. One employee left and then was lead teller in her new region every week for a year or more.
bad,not secure and not good no caring about employee. no good benefit
bad,"The first thing is I am a disabled veteran and on Veteran's Day my manager she gave some people off that for the holiday but didn't ask any of the three Veterans that worked for her if they wanted off. She also once made me stand for a meeting for over an hour even with me reminding her that my combat connected disability states I shouldn't stand for long periods of time. She wasn't very knowledgeable of the products or the procedures. She would never respond to questions, concerns, complaints or anything for that matter. She always came in late, took 2 hour lunches and always left early. She always looked messy, dirty and never wore a bra. It was disgusting. She wrote me up for insubordination for simply telling my coach that questions he told me to ask clients weren't working and I needed other suggestions. Seriously no exaggeration. I've never been wrote up at any job.  Then the coach, he would constantly talk about my breasts. He only helped and actually coached 2 girls. Other then that he never did anything for the rest of us on the team. I once went an entire month without him even saying a single word to me. That would be ok if I wasn't supposed to have a weekly coaching session that he always cancelled cause he was with one of those other girls. The rest of the team would have to rely on another teams coach for everything. It was absolutely the worst environment to work in."
bad,"no room for internal advancement, pay range is low especially for internal promotions"
bad,"All they care about is the sales goals and how many referrals they get. They say they are looking for the best for the client, it's not true. You have to call and bug people to apply for loans or open accounts that are not needed. "
bad,Leadership does not care about employees.  The work environment was very unprofessional
bad,With company for seven years no opportunity for growth even if you perform in top 10%.  Many of the tenured SunTrust teammates who made this company great retired this year.   The focus is on bringing in talent from outside not on the teammates internally.   Senior leadership does not act like senior leadership.   I have never heard a senior leader drop curses as much as I heard my final three months.   Strong company built by the leaders who are leaving.  Turnover ratio is 40-60%.   Ask the question to the person you interview with.  How long was the person in the role before me?    You may be shocked by what you hear for a response.
bad,"All that glitters is not gold.  SunTrust represents itself as a great company to be a part of...NOT SO! Management behaves in immature and child like manners when asked simple questions. The teammate philosophy is a farce. Management carries an ""I'm better than you"" attitude, and borders on the line of racism.  If management behaves inappropriately and it is brought to the attention of Human Resources, nothing will be done and will only further allow management to retaliate when it comes time for your review.  Absolutely horrible company with no morals, values, or idea of how to treat people, especially it's employees."
bad,"Your typical chew you up and spit you out Corporate American company. They could give a rats behind about your personal life. If you dropped dead at your desk, they'd tie a rope around your ankles and pull you away only to be replaced by the next ""body"". Management is the worst."
bad,Sales pressure galore and management is horrible.  Stab you in the back in a heart beat to save their own skin.
bad,The default section of SunTrust is nothing but shadey and a bunch of back stabbing people. Management clearly has favoritism they do not fairly promote people. They expect SunTrust to be number one in your life before your family and if they are not you are of no use to them and will not advance.
bad,"Anyone who wants to work for Suntrust this is my advice, The pay is great as a teller but i swear to you never come up short/over in cash because what ever you tell the manger you will be written up or fired even due you work for a week with handle any training."
bad,One of the most unprofessional places I've ever worked. Unsupportive. Management lacks knowledge of closing requirements and regulations. Management team are all minimalists. Promotions of managers and team leads who know far less than their employees. Manager is a compulsive liar. Company very unorganized. Duties and responsibilities change from day to day. Company operates as if it's in it's 1st year.
bad,"too much going on besides work and professionalism. Managment very unprofessional and prejudice, racisim, stereotypying exist within. There is a lot of 'click' forming. No one seems to know the job or how to solve problems. Good employee's are not recognized."
bad,"Manager was a total moron. She interrupted every conversation with a client, and gave out wrong information. Violated every policy and was never caught. Continued to give out hundreds of dollars in refunds to family and friends. Not competent to do her job at all and blamed other people for this. Her manager has no idea how dumb she is because another manager covers for her."
bad,Ok place to work. Looking for a career change with another company. Hardest part of the job is the fact that there is no team work.
bad,"Private Wealth Management - departments promotes and hires only ‘conflict of interest’ personnel as they receive ‘incentive’ when recommend hire of employees. Only ‘conflict of interest’ personnel receive accommodations – flexible work hours, laptop/ cell phone/, software/ application and training for higher level (future) positions. These ‘conflict of interest’ personnel are not fulfilling the ‘essential functions of the positions’ relying on the ‘less than’ to fulfil. Conflict of interest employees are allowed to ‘study’ while on the job while the other ‘exact same title’ have to work throughout lunch to meet the required duties – unequal work flow. Employer refuses to accept higher performance ranking other than a 3 where employees over achieve their ‘essential functions of the position.’ Human Resource department refuses to abide by Americans with Disability Act of 1990 (ADA) in stated – Reasonable Accommodations for employees with Disabilities due to 'work environment.' Currently undergoing EEOC investigation."
bad,They are not a company that values their employees.......................
bad,This company is focused on corporate and not on its employees and customers.
bad,"Not a great place to work at all. Too much pressure on the employees. Weekly sales goals were unattainable and ridiculous. The branch I worked at was so unprofessional. Managers come and go as they please, especially for ""emergencies"" and ""meetings""."
bad,"It looks good on the out side, really bad on the inside. At least, that was my experience. My biggest negative was management forced us to work 6 days a week, open to close... yet slapped us (with a written notice) if we went over time. Work conditions was sub-par. The worst bank I've ever worked for in my life."
bad,"Whether you are looking to apply at SunTrust, or have already gained employment, move on. Your talents will not be appreciated, your individuality is not accepted. The culture they promote is not the culture they manifest or nurture. Again, move on"
bad,"I worked for the company for 2.5 years and within that time frame I had 3 diffrent area managers. The process and procedures changed often, very inconsistent. I was a salarie employee and was always required to work 45-50 hours weekly and had to work 3 Saturdays per month from 8:30AM6:30 PM. Turn over is high, very demanding job, high pressure sales goals, no work life balance"
bad,Don’t waste your time. They don’t care about you and will drop you in a heartbeat. Goals are set by management and have to be accomplished as a team and not individually. If the team falls down you don’t get a bonus.
bad,Management treats people in any way. They are able to stick around through multiple HR Team Relations complaints due to their personal relationship within the business.
bad,"Your day will be full of meetings without any time to do actual job, but you will be expected to have finished everything even if it means working until 11PM on a week-end."
bad,"Most of the time the day starts with short staff, employees are not happy due to the high pressure for the sales and resulted on high turnover."
bad,It was a struggle and almost unbearable because the person I reported to was a racist who hated white people and created a hostile work environment. Reporting it to management was futile since they were buddy-buddy. The job itself was okay but very stressful.  I'm stronger than they figured I'd be and endured it up until the companywide lay off.
bad,"This is the worst place I have ever worked in my life.There was almost no on the job training. Policy and procedures changed on a weekly basis. You have to figure out everything for yourself even if the client is in front of you. Management does not care about their employees or the clients. All they care about is the sales goals and they are set way to high. If you don't meet your sales goal, you will be written up and If you are written up, you are not eligible for bonuses for a while. They write you up for every little thing so that when they fire you, they won't have to pay you unemployment benefits. They also like to lie to you.You don't want to work for this company because they don't care if you have a personal life or not. They are a bunch of snakes."
bad,"Terrible culture, hardly no advancement opportunities, low pay with low bonuses and unachievable goals, hostile work environments, low ethics, borderline racists, only care about wealthy clients, average clients are shuffled out the door."
bad,"No comments. No additional comments. No further comments at this time."
bad,"SunTrust Mortgage lacks management with mortgage experience. If it wasn't backed by the bank it would not exist. The management here is only concerned with their salaries and bonuses. They use their employees for their own personal gain. The employees are catty and cutthroat especially during the annual beheading or ""reduction in force"" as they call it. Hopefully the Fed will re-review the unethical practices at SunTrust and shut them down for good."
bad,"Haven't been staffed properly since I began my employment. As business increases, staffing decreases."
bad,I worked at a very small branch that was micro-managed by the branch manager so it created a very negative atmosphere.  I was there for a short time and I didn't get to network with other branches so I don't have a view of the company as a whole.
bad,"I was an employee of SunTrust for over five years and I never felt appreciated.  I always met and/or exceeded the goals that were set for me,  but that was never enough.  Suntrust wants clients to believe that they care about helping them meet their financial needs, but they constantly push products.  There isn't any  job security either.  Too much drama to suit me!"
bad,"At the beginning everything was fine; however, with the economy being at its worse everyone is eliminating positions, SunTrust Bank being at its worse. We are extremely short staff, eating lunch is almost impossible most of the time, schedules are not given on time at all and sometimes changed last minute. Overtime does not exist, you either have to take an extra lunch, or leave early but that makes it impossible since the staffing is so short. The environment here is bad, we have bugs, roaches, nets, and possibly mold in the break room and bathrooms. The refridgerator is the most smelliest thing in the break room, we pretty much have no place to eat here in the bank. Technology needs to be updated and ATM machines are always breaking down or out of service... this place is terrible and not recommended."
bad,SunTrust is not a place to work if you are looking for a team environment. They have somehow slipped an I in team over there. The management is the pits as well! Bypass this company if possible!
bad,"training wasnt uniform,alot of favoritism and noone wanted to hear the truth. Everyone was cut throat afraid to speak the truth but unhappy and miserable"
bad,"You can work 20 years and get trashed like you were nothing. Management cares about themselves not you, your family, your life only themselves. Product pushing, not here for clients we’re here for money."
bad,I’ve worked in corporate amaerica dor over 10 years and this is by far the worse job I have ever had in my life. Management is poor.  Dictatorship culture. Mandatory overtime for over a year. Management will write you up if you don’t work mandatory overtime on Xmas eve and major holidays
bad,"Long hours on feet, no manager support,    discrimination, lies about and to employees. Investigators for SunTrust disrespectful.  Lawyers disrespectful and lie.  Beware"
bad,unprofessional and micromanaged ! everyone wants to be in charge besides the main person ! nobody is safe far as personal business & once you tell your manager/ coach everyone knows. not a good look
bad,I worked in an in-store branch and had very little staff.  I had to work 60 to 65 hours a week with no overtime payment.  There were many times I was left alone to run the branch.  My Husband would come during his time off to watch to be sure I was ok.
bad,SunTrust Bank does not believe in promoting within unless you know someone at the top. I worked for them for 5yrs and they told me I made them more money in sales so they did not want to promote me. I worked my butt off just to be told no because I was a financial asset and they didn't even offer me a pay raise since they wouldn't allow me to move up.
bad,The company was always filtering through employees and had a hard time keeping people staffed. They constantly over worked people but continued to never hire quality individuals so the good ones always were over worked and under paid
bad,"The culture they say they have did not match my experience or that of others around me.  I was gaslighted by a coworker who was a ""work place troll"" the first week I was at the company. "
bad,"Working at Suntrust initially started out great, but then new area managers and team leads came and it went for sugar to .....  There were many instances where I was belittled  by my area manager in front of staff.  It is very hard to advance if it’s not something upper management wants you to do. They show no loyalty to their staff, there’s no 3 strikes your out, it’s just your out. If you are looking for growth and job security you will not find it here"
bad,The is the bottom of the tier in positions.  You won't learn a lot about good customer service working here.  You will learn what not to do.  Take that information and move on to a better work place.
bad,For what they pay you for the work that you do is a joke.You have to take 80 calls a day and cross train for other departments. They also have so many metrics that it is impossible for you to get a raise.The raises are like pennies . If you want to waste your time then this is perfect . Career growth is all politics not what you know but who you know.
bad,In its Retail Branches SunTrust has a very bad work environment. They have unrealistic expectations in referrals and sales along with a very demanding and overbearing environment in which you are expected to achieve those results. They have reduced their branch staff to a level that is too thin to properly service their clients.
bad,"People engage in “office politics” and resort to reprehensible tactics and strategies to gain an upper hand. From my experience, their only thought at the end of the year is how big their bonus will be.  Some of the most powerful executives I have met are single-minded and shallow. They’re insensitive, selfish and insecure. Their identity is their company and their title; they focus only on recognition, salary and bonuses. These selfish leaders believe that they have all of the answers. While these leaders claim to understand the bigger picture, they don’t see what matters most – the people that have made them successful."
bad,Working at SunTrust is a joke the management both upper management and branch level could get on the same page operational wise so the rules vary branch to branch on what proper procedure is. you get asked to come in early but leave early to ensure you don't receive the overtime you earned. The training is great and the inner workings of the team both on the banker and teller level is excellent.
bad,"long hour 7pm."
bad,"I have learned if you are not one of the favorites, good luck you will be on your own.  Again it is all about the shareholders. Too much favoritism among some of the co-workers from management. Management says they appreciate all that is being done for the company, but throughout the day you can expect emails blasting you on why this is not done, that is not done, when can I expect it to be done within an 8 hour day. They are very unappreciative."
bad,"This is not a place you or anyone you know would want to work.  They will drive you into the ground, require you to work 23 hours a day, and often 24 if you let them.  There is NO respect for your home life - single mothers are not permitted to leave on time to pick up children if your boss wants you in a meeting.   "
bad,SunTrust not a company for growth and advancement. I worked there for over nineteen years and my salary was 9.00 per hour. The company was prejudice against some employees and not helping to advance. I trained new employees and did a good job for the company. Working in the South the CEO's don't care for the employees only their pockets. It was very stressful job.
bad,"Lots of pressure from all level to meet sales goals, which are in many cases excessive."
bad,Working for SunTrust was not the best experience for me.  During my 9 years of service there was limited learning and limited growth.  This is not a company I would like to work for again in the near future.
bad,"While the duties of the job are pretty average and easy to manage this particular branch has a very high volume. The company refuses to higher the right amount of staff (especially tellers) to service the clients and you'll often times find clients complain about the long wait. The system is outdated and constantly has problems/crashes. The branch itself is old with outdated furniture and décor. While the staff is friendly for the most part you'll be hard pressed to find anyone actually smiling all day(genuinely that is). And this is in large part due to management/human resources who happens to be the most incompetent, phony, overpaid and underqualified group of individuals you'd ever meet. Advancement takes for ever (even if you are amazing at your job) and comes with comical ""pay raises"". There is NO work life balance unless you consider ""heavy drinking every weekend to drown out the miserable reality of having to go back to that place every monday"" a life! The best thing about this job would be the benefits. They are very generous to employees who make 35000 or less, which is most of the staff I found. The hardest part of the job is not having the support from management needed to succeed and job security. But if you are a people person you'll enjoy this location because you'll see lots of people all day and you can develop great relationships with the clients(when they aren't complaining to you). And the staff (excluding management) so basically bankers and tellers, really try to stick together and work as a team. Working here I learned how much of a patient person I really"
bad,"This company (including it's parent, SunTrust Banks), doesn't know  the meaning of effective management (especially upper level, who don't have a clue as to what the minions below them actually do for a living), job security, project or documentation standards or pay grades relative to the amount of work for which any individual below management level is responsible.  I was a contractor, on the outside looking in.  And in no way understood how or why, other than simply not wanting to be unemployed, people actually stayed to work.  RIFs every freaking quarter....constant management departmental reassignment....all in the hopes of MAYBE one day finally getting it right and creating successful, cohesive teams.  Horrible benefits.  You name it.  Was offered perm position. No.  Just no."
bad,"Trying to keep this short and sweet. The training in so far below par that you are left to scramble from the beginning. The yearly goals will be adjusted at least twice in a year to make your job harder. As well as your next boss up will absolutely not care about you or your life; you are paid to push credit cards and if you don't even when you are doing other things well you will be asked to fix it or leave. "
bad,"I worked for them for 5 years in the Atlanta office and the only good thing I can say about this bank is the excel at exploiting its employees. I will not tell you not to accept a job there if you cannot find anything elsewhere, but be prepared:  you will perform the work of three people for half what they pay one person.  Sometimes I feel like the company could anytime ask employees to bring their own chairs and computer to work--that is how cheap they are.  Having said that be prepared to bring your tea, your coffee and your cups. "
bad,"This was the worst job I have had in 25 years.  The level of micromanagement, timekeeping (think punching a clock as a senior management professional), lack of understanding or appreciation for any function outside of private wealth creation.  "
bad,Branches are constantly understaffed; Employees overworked and underpaid (re:non-exempt retail branch employees). Very common for SunTrust to hire a part-time employee (20 hrs/wk for SunTrust benefit purposes) and then part-time employee is scheduled 25-35 hrs/wk.
bad,The company is in a very bad state. It has been a revolving door with more people leaving than coming in. So much great talent has left because of over aggressive sales with very little benefit to clients or employees.
bad,"Poor management. High turnover. No opportunity for advancement. No set policies. Everything is managers discretion. Very political. You can tell who will get the next position before it is even posted. No continuous training. Unrealistic sales goals, so much so that they offer double points to help meet the goals that are still unattainable."
bad,"The Charlotte, NC office is horrible. Management has zero people skills and creates unnecessary turnover. If management set aside their ego, and actually empowered their staff, it would grow exponentially, as there really are some talented people in the Charlotte office; unfortunately, most of the talent leaves, and newbies come in green and ready to work, only to find out they are misinforming consumers of delivery times, locks, closing, etc. "
bad,They cut enployees and expect those left to pick up the slack.   Stressful.  Not worth the stress.  Not worth the pay.   Chattanooga market
bad,"This is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for in my entire life! The pay is okay, but for what they require you to do it is not worth it. I would take a job paying me the same just to get out of there. The goals are absurd and completely unrealistic depending on your location. They have a very high turn over rate because they do not cultivate a positive work environment....especially with upper management. They micro manage every second of your day and you will be flooded with emails about goals, sales leads, getting new deposits, etc. If you have other options for employment take them. This is not worth the stress."
bad,"In my current capacity, I serve as our company’s first line of defense. Being cognizant of current regulatory changes, laws, and deadlines is crucial to the continued success of SunTrust. As the quarterback for consumer lending, I directly manage each step of the loan process. Due diligence is a vital component within my role, and as such,  I am diligent in monitoring and remediating compliance, ensuring the  protection of our clients, and our company. Vendor management is another critical component of my daily routine, establishing relationships,  and nurturing these relationships in order to enhance the embodiment of our “One Team” philosophy."
bad,"SunTrust Banks is slave to the almighty dollar no matter the cost. They will harass current clients to get them to sign up for accounts and services they don't need or want. They treat employees like indentured servants. For instance, if you are working towards a degree or certificate, outside of regular business hours, that directly relates to you job, they will make you miss classes if it in any way inconveniences them, even if SunTrust is giving you tuition reimbursement for it."
bad,"would be to take in deposits from clients and provide them with balances when asked.  I also would inform them about our products that we provide such as IRAs, CDs checking and saving accts."
bad,"Recruited from another bank and promised all kinds of wonderful things. At first, it seems great, then you get seasoned and realize that goals are completely unattainable and double standards are everywhere. Save yourself!"
bad,SunTrust was a great place to work up until the last six months. Four to five conference calls per day on sales numbers. SALES is all it is about.
bad,"This is a place that uses the term, ""client first"", but it really should read Suntrust first. Loyalty scores are low because they just don't get it, that customers are not loyal to the bank, they are loyal to the tons of loyal employees that work at the bank. How can you expect excellence when you have a herd of idiots running a business. Bankers who don't even have a clue how to manage their overall bottom lines. Why be open til 6 pm Monday thru Friday with a cut off of 5pm on Monday thru Thursday, when your ATM accepts deposits til 9 pm. Ok, I can see if a branch is EXTREMELY busy between 5 and 6 but really, who re-evalutate the cost having to have 2 employees at a branch, for 1 or 2 deposits. Who does the cash flow projections for each branch to see what works and what does not work. Non are the same. They come up with rules and say, we will all be universal but then as soon as upper upper management hang up the phone area managers are like renegades and do whatever they want to do. This role clarity they have rolled out, makes sense on paper but is something that can not function in reality because everyone is running around aggrevated and stressed out over people with big egos and power trip mindsets. I hope to NEVER work for another woman as long as I live, and coming from a female to say that is really bad in 2012. The mentality of some are just childlike but others are so miserable with their own lives that they don't even realize or care that, their bad night at home is going to make everyone under them very unhappy and reckless for the next few days or weeks. A total"
bad,Hours were from 8:30 to 7:30 with only a half an hour lunch break. Enviroment was cramped and team mates were very unhappy. Management was untrained and overworked with very little coaching skills. The worst experience in the work place I've ever endured. I would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,The managers DO Not know how to give constructive feedback.
bad,Horrible company horrible culture...no organization whatsoever. Employee turn  around is sky high.. Out of 10 other employees in my training class I was the last one left after 3 months. Fast food jobs can keep employees longer than suntrust.. Take my word for it when I say this place sucks..
bad,Atmosphere was toxic overworked underpaid always threatened with layoffs not a good atmosphere. I've seen a lot of talented workers over look for position that they were qualified for and sometimes even more than qualified for I think that the management style is outdated and they don't know how to recognize loyal to your talent not a good fit for somebody that as realistic goals
bad,You have to follow a script when speaking to clients. I don’t like being told how to talk to people. I’ve been in customer service for 20 years and never had to follow a script. You’re also micromanaged when helping clients gtoensure you’re following the script.
bad,"You have no life there, working super long shifts and they have a high turnover rate. Managers are super micro management . Especially the merger is about to happen and they act like they don’t know nothing"
bad,"The management shows favoritism.  They will not admit that the new system is flawed and makes mistakes that they put against you.  Have to take vacation time to go to doctor appointments, etc. Stressed tellers go about referrals."
bad,Didn’t like the company at all.  People were back stabbers and the management were liars.  Do not try to apply for this company. It is the same way across the whole footprint.
bad,"I worked for very large, global firms all my life before coming to ST. I thought I had seen it all but ST takes all the negative experiences one can possibly have with a company and rolls them all up into one. Training doesn't prepare you for what you'll be doing, then you get dinged for every mistake you make - and so many dings add up to an incredibly high turnover/burnout. I've seen veterans of several years have their desk packed up while on a 15 minute break at ST. If you are terminated, they deny your benefits due to ""misconduct"". This is easily overturned by appeal, but just another example of how your negative experience at ST keeps giving even after you leave. Horrible company that rules on the principles of management by intimidation."
bad,"A typical day at the branch begins with a huddle of the team with the branch manager demanding and leading by fear to start the day. "
bad,"Loan application system is slow, problematic,and outdated."
bad,"Was a very stressful job, everyday we had to have a goal of either someone opening a new checking/saving, credit card, mortgage, refi, car loans.  least 3 a day we had to get and if we did not we got yelled at and our jobs threated by management  It was hard to get people to open new accounts or bring in new money"
bad,i just need to leave I dont want to work there anymore. I feel that there was no room for advancement. and I think they have poor management and slow processes
bad,"Scripted ""client delight"" calls. Management never supports processors...Always side with loan officers...Never their fault. All suntrust cares about is the stupid surveys. They brag about how profitable they are, yet bonus & comp plan are a joke."
bad,OK place in which to work if you're 25 years old. A lot of partiality shown to certain individuals and not much work ethic for those of us who have a good one.
bad,"No concept of management - embarrassing redundancies.  Call lists were useless, including many deceased clients.  No regard for the Do Not Call list."
bad,Worst bank to work for. Management is very negative. It is all about sales and more sales. You are just a glorified used car sales men. No respect
bad,Very hard to work for. Extremely demanding on employees and management was very disconnected.  I would never return to work there under any circumstance.
bad,"Good old boys network at the top, too many highly paid managers that have poor management and leadership skills. Many technical people are promoted to management and can't manage and have terrible personal skills"
bad,"Management was terrible, sales goals were ridiculous, an absolutely terrible place to work. Management did not want to help with anything, and never had any idea of what was going on. People had to stay after work hours to make calls in order to drum up business."
bad,One of the worst job I've worked. The mortgage loan officers bully people. The managers are scared to speak to mortgage loan officers. There are all kinds of unprofessional talks throughout the day. Racial slurs were used.
bad,Good company to work for but management makes it hard to enjoy working for the company therefore retention rate is high.
bad,"SunTrust was a wonderful company to work for, however in the past two to three years, they have hired almost exclusively externally...many from B of A and a few other banks.  The culture has changed drastically- becoming very B of A-like, and unfortunately that's not a good thing. This company now has a horrible culture in which to work.  "
bad,"Fast paced assembly like document production environment.  Micromanagement, with no family life balance.Conservative environment replete with cronyism, no breaks, unreasonable expectations to learn 7+ specific bank applications within 30 days and on your own time as OT is only approved for the most favored. Although presented as professional positions, most are administrative and require a typing speed of 55+ wpm."
bad,"Although my manager and co-workers were nice, upper management didn't really seem to care. All they pushed was sell sell sell. If you do not meet your goals your fired. How in this economy when 9 out of 10 people calling are calling for fee refunds do they expect you to book 10 accounts per month? If they can't handle one account how would they handle more than one? They outsource outside of the US so there went some more jobs and service. If they think customers would be happy about that change they are crazy. They would ask if they were calling America and I don't even have an accent so imagine someone that does. The client's that called for the most part were just angry, hateful people with the rare nice person that called you. I would never work for a bank if I can help it again in my lifetime. They claim to care about customers/clients but all they really care about is turning a profit and don't even do a good job disguising it lol. The shift bidding is based on how well you perform with sales being high on the list so you get the wosrt shifts if you don't sell and advancement yeah more like they pick the favorite brown noser to promote so don't even think about advancing if your a normal, nice, hard working person with a good work ethic that isn't enough for them. But even the good pay wasn't enough and when I was let go I was smiling from ear to ear as the happiest day of my life. I hated working there and I don't hate anywhere else I have worked at in all my life."
bad,They destroyed 28 safety deposit boxes before i started and then made me take ownership of it with no assistance.  Very bad!  They only care about getting your 3 core sales a day...no matter what.
bad,"I worked for SunTrust for 5 years and it changed a lot from the beginning to the end. Unrealistic sales goals became the norm with threat of losing your job as ""motivation"". They fired people for the safe act infractions even if you were previously an exemplery employee. Do NOT even apply if you have any sort of crime of dishonesty (the obvious is theft which makes sense but also false statements to police, dui/dwi,any possession with intent, bad checks etc etc) and the kicker is even if it was dismissed through deferred adjudication or pretrial diversion, you are not able to be hired. However, that may be good because working there is a climate of micromanaging and competition, which is good, until people start becoming unethical to meet the unrealistic expectations. My coworkers were great, my direct management was great, although turnover is really high because of the demands on managers. upper management is horrendous and do not care about the employees, the are a profit driven company like other banks. Yes, banking hours are nice but the office will follow you home when you are constantly afraid of losing your job. It is difficult to advance as they tend to bring in outside people to hire for big positions. They failed the stress test and are not as stable as they would like to appear. they do not care about customers other than how to get them a line of credit, credit card or maintenence fees unless they have large deposit accounts. "
bad,"Great concept/bad idea. Overworked, underpaid. Bank wanted to get into the subprime market, and I was recruited, and wined and dined to head up this territory. Should have stayed where I was. Bad idea to move. Moved just before the 1st big refi boom. Bank did not understand subprime banking, and was only in to make a profit."
bad,"A typical day at work includes sales, service, and coaching of other teammates. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping my clients and teaching my teammates how to help clients. Currently, the hardest part of my job is dealing with everyday changes the company is going through. I currently have a great team willing to go above and beyond to help our clients."
bad,There are constant changes within this company. I had not learned anything from my training. Training was split up into separate sessions. Every other week I had to return to training for a minimum of 3 days up to 10 days. I spent more time in training and at other branches than I did at my own branch. The company is disorganized when it comes to communicating effectively. Management does not manage the way that they should. Every manager that I had encountered does not greet clients nor do they ever leave their office.
bad,"We were mislead about the job title and duties....it ended up being a tedious support clerk type position advertised as something at a much higher level. The work environment was very hostile, and the supervisor was unprofessional and rude. She expected us to dress professionally while she looked like a slob. They made the temps park in a dirt (mud) parking lot a block away. I've heard Suntrust is better in other cities, but in Richmond, VA, they were awful."
bad,The work environment is very negative. High pressure for sales and the managers are not well trained to lead employees. The customers are mostly pleasant and customer service should be top priority instead of sales for loans they don’t need and pushing credit cards.
bad,"When SunTrust first came to North Carolina they were a great company to work for. They became micromanaged and then it became a issue. If you did make a score of 100% of your goal, they would let you go."
bad,Not a job for long term. Temporary at best. Poor management starting at the top. Benefits are ok. Not competitive pay with other financial institutions. Technology and customer service is horrible for clients and staff.
bad,Great position worked with a great team until they brought in a new manager. No matter how much you complain to HR or regional managers nothing will be done. So you either quit or suck it up and take the mis-treatment
bad,"will leave an office without management for months leaving only tellers in the branch. No leadership unless you are apart of the ""click"". Director will take credit for account opening  from employees and apply to more favored employees."
bad,"My co workers were great. Lots of rewarding clients. Been with them for over a year and from loving this job at the beginning, it became overwhelming and very stressful towards the end. The manager didn't know how to handle the branch. I cannot count how many times that I had to work alone running back and forth helping the lobby and drive thru. There were weeks that we had to work without any scheduled set for the week. We will get a phony schedule for the whole month in our email only to show that the manager did what he was asked to do by the area manager. After a very busy and stressful day with only 2 tellers the most at the teller line, not even a simple recognition for us to feel motivated."
bad,Its very political its all about who you know. I have seen several great employees leave due to the oversight of acomplishments. It was a great starting point to build knowlege but to advance you must find a new company
bad,very much a bottom line company.  People who work there are simply peanuts to be counted so the bank can drive shareholder value.  Sacrifices  employee well being for shareholder value.  Middle management is across the board incompetent and not qualified to lead their areas
bad,it was hard to keep up with family and working for this mortgage industry. it is very cut throat and don't give you enough time to go to bathroom or even eat lunch
bad,"Long story short, I wish I never applied to work for the company. Too many goals, and the hours suck for instore positions. No life-work balance. Great bank as a customer, just not as an employee."
bad,workplace culture and upper management is really bad and needs major improvment in the West Florida area.The issues has not been address in the last 15 years... Diversity and inclusion is not recognized.
bad,"Very backward thinking company without much of a clue how to compete in today's workplace. Senior managers are completely disconnected from the line employees, and mediocrity is about the best that can be hoped for. Whenever a new challenge comes up (i.e. identifying a risk), the response is most typically to put in more complexity and monitoring vs. figuring out the root cause and fixing it."
bad,"This company does not have a good training program. The goals are very high and you have no work life balance. We had an average of "
bad,sometimes they are so confused to how handle the people but they need to fix it immidiately to those of their agents. my workmates is so fun while working of them the company is non salary base
bad,"Administered daily functions; open/close branch; such as greeting and assisting customers; informed customers of ways to bank, and/or improve their banking needs; order cash weekly; handled main vault; supervised CSS, part-time teller, and full-time teller; accurately opened and settled cash drawer; handled large and small cash transactions; settled cash advance machine at the end of each day;  provided exceptional customer service to each customer with each encounter."
bad,I think the company as a whole was a great organization to work for however the management staff had a loft of issures due to the start up of a new branch
bad,"I have higher education than all my coworkers combined. Instead of being offered a desk side position, I was told that I'd have to start as a teller and move up. However, my manager never allowed me to do so. She did nothing and forced me to do her work. She had another employee move up with no education and poor grammar."
bad,"Sales culture- Only in it for the bottom line, not the client."
bad,"Culture was not great, and so many teammates are in exempt job grades but not eligible for a bonus.  Focus on efficiency ratio for this “merger of equals” meant doing a lot more with a lot less people.  Wouldn’t recommend working at Truist for a while."
bad,"I hated this job. I had panic attacks everyday. I hated it. Worse job I ever had. My health and sanity is not worth the money. If you have kids, this job will be impossible. Everything is considered an occurrence. You also have to get there 30 minutes early to check numerous emails and log into about 12 systems. You do not get paid for this 30 minutes. Management is no help and do not care. I hated, hated, hated this job. You also get graded and have to take weekly test just like school. This place is worse than school. There’s no communication, everything is through chat or email. There is hardly any face to face contact with management and training  is a joke. Oh, yeah. Don’t forget to sale, sale, sale...."
bad,"There is a good amount of talk about how to do it right, however the execution of it is sometimes lacking in certain areas of the bank. There are a handful of senior leaders that I believe truly do try to exhibit the culture, but they are overshadowed by the immense amount of those that are oblivious to what the ideals truly are."
bad,"Very fast pace and have to meet quotas for the day, week and month. Your co-workers are who you will learn on with this company. Heavy turnover within the company."
bad,I really have nothing positive to share therefore I will keep it minimal. The duties I performed were enjoyable however management is very cutthroat and run business based on personal feelings. I put in 10 yrs developing my career only to be targeted due to illness which is out of my control.
bad,Lack professionalism and team environment. Financial center treated customers like they were just dollar signs and lacked in customer service. The employees did not work as a team but individually and there was o drive.
bad,"SunTrust offers little if no advancement and any position you are advanced to, SunTrust gives you a whopping 3% raise..  You have to leave and come back to get the pay you deserve for the position.."
bad,"The company pays well, and tends to use money to attract and retain employees (Teammates, as they are called).  However the culture is very hard driving, with very long hours being the norm.  "
bad,"SunTrust is a current day Titanic and it's sinking fast. The managers are jumping first. I loved working with my co-workers in the branch but everyone in upper management puts so much stress on their employees that they are all looking to quit. It's not worth the stress. They don't do equal pay for men and women. If you are a woman, you will get paid less than a man would. They have goals that are unreachable and will try to fire you if you don't hit them. The best position is being a teller because the referral goals aren't as bad as platform. What stresses you out being a teller is they don't have enough employees so you bust your butt for them and there's no appreciation. Even if you hit your goal, they will still say it's not enough. The benefits used to be good, but they get worse and worse every year. There will be days that you don't get a lunch break because people call out all the time. They call out because they don't want to be there. Worst bank I've ever worked for and it's all because of the upper management decisions and the stress they put on their employees. One more thing. They tell you every year that they can't afford to give raises so they will give you 1%-2%. My annual salary only rose $1500 in 5 years. They rarely promote too. If you are looking for less pay, more stress, no raises, no promotions, and to be criticized about every thing you do wrong even if you hit your goals, then this is the job for you."
bad,I didn't like working with the coworkers they were very nasty to each other they never got along and always looking for reason to tell on one another. The job duties were fine but the managers and staff were impossible to work with.
bad,"Stay away from Youngsville NC branch. Team is horrible to work with. Management has no control over their employees and say ""they create"" workers this way when you complain. Harassment is tolerated & allowed to continue. Management is no better at top of company. An employee showed up 5 minutes late to an employee meeting & management MADE everyone applaud & embarrass employee. Head Teller is a tyrant in this branch!"
bad,"Very stressful, fast paced. Angry and upset callers all the time. Management ""down your throat"" about EVERY detail, ALL THE TIME. Clients are no.1 and always right period. Company does not care about the mental well being of their employees, and they have high turnover in the call center as a result."
bad,"I group of people were leaving the company and I stayed and cleaned up the mess they left behind.  I was honest that the group may offer me a job in the future.  For my efforts I was named in a law suit, personally named, because I choose to take another job that benefited my company.  I will not work for SunTrust again."
bad,The worst part of the job was the high sales goals that were mandatory. In my opinion it changed how I viewed banking and the helpfulness of the staff.
bad,good manager but everything else is bad.  stressed out all of the time about whether my bank drawer is exact or not at the end of the day. too much anxiety.
bad,"Micro manangement on a whole new level! Surveys and loan close.... No acceptions! No personal life after working here... Your mind is never on ease as all you think about is your manager yelling at you and processing them loans. Too much work! Too much meetings and classes! Its just over kill of duties for the processors. "
bad,"This company is very difficult to work for as they dont provide a clear direction for the business line and support is very minimal. The benefits and pay are exceptional, but dont come close to balancing the frustrations that come from a lack of good management direction."
bad,"Help clients with financial needs."
bad,Second time working for the company and I enjoyed it better in Atlanta. The department I worked in lacked the professionalism I was use to coming from a fortune 500 company.
bad,Managers do whatever they please and no real HR to keep them in check. Buyer beware.
bad,"They play favorites, so people only stay employed if they are a really cool with their manager or someone high enough in management to speak up for them when they are not liked by a member of management."
bad,The department was so overstaffed that associates would spend days with no work to do.  I like to be busy when I'm at work.  Management did not show any concern for employees.
bad,"I am an employee that is losing his job due to SunTrust Mortgage sending my job to India-when I ask why-I was told it was due to ""Cheaper Labor""- We still have companies out here despite getting a massive Tax Break- still shipping American jobs to India for cheaper labor-""DONT DO BUSINESS WITH SUNTRUST BANK OR SUNTRUST MORTGAGE"" THEY ARE GREEDY AND DO NOT REALLY CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS OR EMPLOYEES"" Is all about their numbers and nothing else"
bad,I prefer not to include a review on my current employer.  I am grateful for the time that I have worked here and feel that everyone has different experiences.
bad,"The Regional Trust Advisors are great:  intelligent, well-educated, and great people skills (as expected given the nature of the job). However, the ""good ole boy"" culture persists, & the result is a lot of managers that are grossly unqualified & frankly stupid."
bad,"Far too much bureaucracy created by people who have worked their entire careers here and are very resistant to change.  Policies ill-defined, if they exist outside an email from a senior manager.  More often than not the attitude is that you are guilty until proven innocent whenever something goes wrong, if you happen to have loads of contextual evidence showing you did everything in your power to prevent something bad from transpiring the people who should be taken to task over it are usually given a slap on the wrist, if anything.  Frequently, senior management will start a new process or procedure only to discontinue it a few months later.  More often than not you find out about a change in policy when you are yelled at for not following the new policy you weren't informed existed.  New processes and procedures are created with little, if any input from those who will be most affected by them.  Culture (or lack thereof) seems to be primarily rooted in stabbing co-workers in the back and/or throwing them under the bus whenever possible."
bad,This company is ok to work for. They are very bias in the management department. Their raises is a joke. They divide department to work against each other.
bad,I worked there and left on good terms but tried to go back and they where like come in for an interview so we can get you back on. Well of course that did not happen. Kinda glad they did not I make a whole lot more an hour doing less.
bad,Sr Leadership team is incompetent and made many strategy mistakes that caused poor performance. Many people have lost their jobs EXCEPT Senior Leaders
bad,"I have worked with many organizations and without a doubt the Hampton Roads market was terrible. Management was dishonest, required the sales of inappropriate products. Workplace violence was supported. Hopefully the merger clean house and these criminals will be fired."
bad,Old boy network.  It will Never be a be anything but an regional bank. Worst year of my life. I obviously have nothing positive to say so writing until I get to the minimum to exit this
bad,"Overall good place to work customers build a relationship with you but moving up can be a little tricky if your not hitting your goal, also transferring can be tricky"
bad,"After twenty eight years in the Financial Services industry, I am interested in using skills and experience to enter back into workforce and make the contribution I am qualified to make."
bad,Manager was horrible. Co-workers were nasty. Never knew when I would be working. Sales driven to a point of unbelievable stress.
bad,Not a fun place to work. Employee are pressure and very sales driven. Sales goal very unrealistic.
bad,This is a very fast paced environment work environment. You work non-stop and overtime is required to get your job completed. They pay well to compensate you for your time at work. They are a reactive company and not very proactive. The solve problems rather than look at ways to prevent them.
bad,The Bank gives you an extra interest rate if you save on a checking account as for time deposit emergency fund withdrawal is always available when you reach 24 months
bad,"This suntrust that I worked at was okay at the beginning. But, they are human. its a job I cant complain. I worked there to pay my bills. and it did just that job paying my bills. Thank you"
bad,"Overall, SunTrust is a good company to work for, but the work ethic's and stress that is placed upon every employee is over whelming."
bad,Processed several transactions with speed and accuracy.  Management does not have your back with termination decisions.
bad,SunTrust needs to train there Managers and team leads to be more professional. SunTrust really doesn't care about there employees. They only care about meeting there numbers.
bad,"Internal Recruitment: Horrible communicators. Unprofessional. Ghosters. Embarrassing.  They will be your downfall to finding future talent and stain the company’s reputation. "
bad,"At suntrust, they have made it basically impossible to advance. I am overly qualified  to do so, but depending on the manager, moving up in the company can become nearly impossible."
bad,One of the best companies I have ever worked.  Great people to work with.  I also love the technology that we implemented.  Very successful company and still is.
bad,"I did not enjoy this job.  I just wanted to help customers with the needs they were concerned about.  However, banks are only concerned with convincing customers to sign up for more accounts that I, as a teller was constantly told I had to offer to the customers even when I already knew the customer was not interested."
bad,"I come from a sale and customer service background of 20 years.  I have worked in sales, management, and customer service and have seen over the years the end result of this kind of environment. The short term results are top ranking branches, managers, and district managers.  The side results are high turnover, resentment, and fear instilled into employees.  Personally, I do well here, but I can see the overall affect on teammates.  They act courteous, and respectful to the district manager in person, but when she leaves they talk behind her back, ridicule her, and totally disrespect her.  Do I blame them...no.   Everyday managers are required to call in the branches production.  If one manager is off in his/her numbers, they are scolded like kids in front of all their peers.   I am not in management but have enough experience to know what works and what does not. This district manager has had great results for a long time, but I promise you this will not last.  Times are changing, business is changing.  This will not suffice for long.  The turnover is terrible here and the moral is declining.  This is not rocket science.  Treat your employees like kids..... keep  your thumb over their heads watching everything they do..... act like you are above them... and they will despise you.  I understand other banks operate like this, but I have worked for three banks... this has been the worst.  In addition, the technology is way behind and unproductive resulting in bankers wasting large amounts of time dealing with locking systems, non-streamline programs(everything is in a different"
bad,"Ensuring my teammates met their production goals n a timely manner, helping teammates if needed."
bad,"Typical day is processing wire transactions in WIre Operations, Analyzing all Mortgage closing documents"
bad,"I enjoy working with my team, and building client relationship. "
bad,Mainly a day a this job would entail monitoring a closed circuit television.
bad,A very important part of my responsibilities was to pay close attention to documents.
bad,"You will be micro-managed to death! It is a cut-throat company. Employees are put under so much pressure to make some really absurd goals that you will have a regional manager, branch manager, or somebody above you hounding you constantly for your sales numbers. The only way to move-up the ladder in this company is if you know someone in the company. Doing what is right by the customer is NOT the way it is done here. Already have 5-checking accounts? I'm sure they could use 3 or 4 more!"
bad,Management horrible to work with. Unethical and unprofessional. They treat employees without respect. Not possibility to grow. Gossip from managers makes it stressful environment.
bad,"Suntrust was one of the worst paying jobs I ever had. They seemed more focused on trying to shove loans, mortgages and credit cards down customer throats then truly trying to led the customer to ""financial success"". The hours were great for work-life balance so long as you were not in a grocery store There were plenty of paid holidays. There seemed to be possibilities for advancement after years of being in one position. Sales, at least to me, depended greatly on your location and the demographic/market you had to choose from. "
bad,Training for this department is almost non existant. The first week of training is over basic customer care. The second week is digital care. In that week you will be introduced to the 19 computer systems that you will need to know to be able to do your job.  During week 3 by Wednesday you are moved out to the floor to answer calls. It's sink or swim
bad,"Entering borrower's personal, appraisal, note,1008, 1003, flood zone, and sfe for fannie mac and mae information for the loans we purchase from the correspondent department- check to see if the appraiser license was up to date-we also did government loans check FHA assignment dates and numbers- VA loan analysis to get the tax information for the borrower and co-borrower paycheck-We had to make sure our hud matches there hud (within a few dollars). We also had to make sure we our ratios match,"
bad,"No work life balance"
bad,Regional manangers do not care for the approach or relationship between branch representative and customer since pushing products is more important as well as meeting goals.
bad,"The Favorite Few Processors are allowed the favorable benefits, but all others are just employees who are fortunate to have a job that pay a salary.  High and consistent turnover of Employees due to the fore mentioned and existing issues."
bad,Had a terrible time working for this company because of the managers and supervisors at my branch. Im sure it is a good company it all depends on where you land
bad,"Looking forward to advance career after ten years in financial industry.  Several years of experience with customer service, leadership and conflict resolution."
bad,"Some managers are good and help you grow, others keep your salary as low as possible."
bad,"Ok, low-paying job with benefits.  Corporate mentality.  Lots of wasted time in pointless meetings and last manager wanted me to join toastmasters, which I thought bizarre and had nothing to do with my job.  No bonuses, overtime pay, or monetary incentives of any kind.  Periodic raises did not keep up with cost of living."
bad,"suntrust is being bought out by BB&T, and lets hope its for the better. The company needs to throw away everyone starting from the top and start over."
bad,Client are very upset due to technical problems so Call center agents/Supervisors pay for this problem. Company's policy doesn't allow employees to disconnect calls when clients are abusive and offensive. Employees are mistreated by angry clients
bad,Great place to work if you like being micro managed. Could be a great company to work for if the process was different. The pay was ok but the hours are long and you work some holidays
bad,"temporary position that was not conducive to job advancement. Work environment was stressful. It was challenging which is good however, not much incentive given to advancement."
bad,"I worked here for 4yrs and my manager told me because I brought in a lot of money through balance transfers she didn't think it was a good idea to post out. She denied all my applications that I submitted to post out and another manager realized it but because they were friends she stated she could not do anything but recommend I post out of state that's the only way I'd be able to advance. I was disappointed and in awe, I resigned."
bad,At first they were way behind on the compliance that was established by the government. They made the incentive program unreachable by processors and closers.
bad,Managerment wasn't fair or understanding. Human resource was for managers not for the employees. Lot of benfit was taken away. Co workers was good. You get blamed for mistakes that supervisors and managers didn't explain the process or produres correct. The most enjoyable part was meeting new friends.
bad,"Depending on the area, SunTrust can be a great place to work or full of discrimination. Larger, more populated areas don't seem to have the personal pressure that smaller markets do."
bad,"Lots of meetings and reviews. Everyone has their nose to the grindstone. Nice people but very tense, anxious environment. No communications from managers. Difficult to ascertain expectations."
bad,This job will leave no space for personal life and will fill you with guilt just for taking you required day off while never promising you hours.
bad,"I was eager when I joined SunTrust, because I was under the impression that, being a smaller bank, they would be more client driven. I felt like I would have an opportunity to grow, as well.This was definitely not the case."
bad,"This company is way behind in comparison to its competitors when it comes to technology. Their process systems are outdated and slow. There is no work life balance because management expects you to stay late at night and come in on the weekends sometimes even requiring you to work from home. If you don’t mind not seeing family, friends or having a moment for yourself this is the company for you. In orientation they tell you from day one they are for profit and that is just what they mean. At the expense of their employees they do indeed turn a profit. I would not recommend this company. I did make a lot of money in my salary, overtime and bonus but it wasn’t worth it with the stress that management puts on you and the micro managing and long hours was unbearable. The hardest part of this job was a cross between the unrealistic expectations from management and all the systems you had to use just to process. Also who manually does GFE comparison calculation in the industry anymore? SunTrust!"
bad,"Enjoyed working relation with majority of co-workers.  The only problem was in the area of compensation, and in some cases management inability to show emphatize with employees who are either out to due injuries attained on the job or due to loss of family members."
bad,"The management at SunTrust is horrible, little development and hardly any opportunity for advancement. They treat most employees like little children, can you say micromanaged?"
bad,Very low pay and no consideration for a balance in life and work.
bad,I definitely noticed a huge wage increase in the same role I had at Suntrust with another company. Like 14k more which lets me know we were grossly underpaid. Constant management changes. In the 2.5 years I was at Suntrust I had 8 different managers.Once news about the merger kicked in the management checked out. They’re still hiring in the fraud department knowing they are going to eventually move the department to Charlotte
bad,"Great opportunities to develop relationships with clients, but a company that lacks a work/life balance.  Always seemed to be short-staffed, which caused a stressful work environment, and unnecessary errors."
bad,"I hated this company. The pay is terrible. They overwork you. They never listen to you. It is so goal oriented, it just feels like your pushing products instead of actually banking. I would not recommend at all."
bad,Instore hours are very long.  The job duties are very stressful.  I would not recommend Instore if you have a family.  I was terrible. management competes with the team on goals.
bad,Management is horrible! Clients call all the time with frustrations because different teammates provide different information we all are trained different. Systems are horrible they shut down in the middle of a call and takes Forbes to bring back up. Everyday there’s a new rule or regulations that completely goes against previous rules. Attendance policy is horrible points count against you for 1 full calendar year. Work environment is terrible and micro management is bad. There’s hardly any help ever and honestly it’s just stressful
bad,"The mission and the onUp movement are awesome. However, the lack of leadership, unrealistic demands and horrible technology makes for a hard place to work and accomplish goals."
bad,It is not a very family orientated place to work.  They do not care about there employee's just the bottom line number.  I do not feel like all branches have the same attitude toward there employee's i may have just gotten a bad apple.
bad,"After over a half year I decided I needed to continue my education so that I could exit the financial industry all together.  Management was mean and threatening, it was the most oppressive environment."
bad,"pay was okay, but the extreme high turn over rate and poor leadership is not worth it. no clear instructions on anything or how anything goes on in the company or handled. go with any other bank than this, i went to bank of America, much better."
bad,"worked here for 2 years and trust me it has been worst experience of my life. Management was good. Co workers were totally annoying. Everything is about sales. You meet your goal and they'll always expect more from you. A very good working environment who can handle additional stress. I wasn't fired nor asked to resign. i resigned by my own will just because I was sick and tired of it. I mean tell where in the world would you find a place where you can take your vacation in a limited time. Once i asked for 2 days off and my manager tells me ""according to HR you are allowed to have vacation only if you take 5 consecutive days"". I busted my brains out for 2 years. And i was told that if i help them out they will promote me. But, no promotion was given. Actually they started giving me work that was not even my responsibility. Glad to make it out of here. I am not afraid to say all this. If anyone needs a clarification feel free to email me. rabbelv@gmail.com. Consider other option people. You dont wanna work for this corporate."
bad,"My immediate team and supervisor are terrific. They are hard working and supportive. The upper management makes big decisions in a ""shoot-from-the-hip"" manner and then reverses these decisions having direct impact on rewards and compensation. It appears to the internal organization that they do not know what they are doing."
bad,"Good core group of people within your area."
bad,"When you get hired asked to see the pay plan for the personal bankers.  Once you see it you would think an MIT Graduate wrote it, it's very complicated.  Every year it gets updated and becomes more complicated and confusing.  Secondly, when you get hired watch your points (these are what earn you commission).  The company is very sneaky to not pay you, and if you have proof they don't care.  Their excuse is that you are suppose to submit any incorrections at a certain date."
bad,A typical day at work consisted of helping customers stay in their homes by advising them of all their options. I learned that it was very informative about some help within the organization as well as outside that customers can utilize in order to get their accounts current. The hardest part of the job was being able to assists with extremely delinquent accounts. My co-workers were willing to help me to navigate screens to be able to further assists customers.
bad,"The hardest part is that the job was knowing my name represented.  What I learned is that benefits and pay was not worth sacrificing self respect.  "
bad,Its a job. It was very stressful and turnover was really high.  Co-workers were very helpful
bad,The Company was average to work for. My co-workers were extremely friendly and helpful.
bad,"I took this position with limited expectations, and it didn't disappoint.  No matter what your numbers, it was never good enough.  Past success didn't matter, what have you done for me lately philosophy."
bad,"Work starts at 8am until 5:30p includes two breaks and a 30min lunch.I contact past due clients and assist them to bring their accounts current. I work with a very small group of co-workers, and i will say the hardest about my job is when i'm not able to assist our customer or help him bring his accont current, they most i enjoy about my job is able to help client with their account problems and concerns."
bad,I worked in 2 departments that were down sized and they are constantly letting people go. Management do not motatvate employees and suntrust o not care about there employees.
bad,"The work environment is exceptionally stressful. Employees receive minimal training on archaic systems that are barely related to the live systems used when interacting with customers. Management is a mixed bag. Some of them are decent people and know their stuff, others have no clue what they're doing and really shouldn't be in the positions they are in."
bad,worked in a horrible environment. Most unprofessional bank i have ever worked at.
bad,"As commercial credit card products go, SunTrust's ESP system does have a lot to offer and can support small to mid-size businesses; with support staff that are professional. No issues here."
bad,"Not everyone will share my experience but the crew I worked with will agree, if you are part of a specific ""group"" you will have a chance, otherwise expect to be used and fired within a year."
bad,"I was tasked with working hand in hand with branches. 4 of my 5 branches didnt have managers for over 6 months. Pay was sub par. 3 teammates quit & my portfolio swelled from 120 to 300 clients. Covering for 3 other portfolios limited efficiency and effectiveness of relationship managers considerably. Also, upper management lost touch with the value needed for business and commercial clients as well as retail clients.. Lost a number of great employees and implemented draconian policy"
bad,Management was unnecessarily manipulative and mean. Not a good culture at all. No autonomy. Definitely no perks. Overall not a good experience.  Did not enjoy my time there.
bad,"At the beginning everything was great. The supervisors were friendly, but they don't make you feel as if you're part of the company. I feel as even if you're a temporary employee, you should be treated the same as permanent employees when it comes to meetings, company events, etc. Contractors were never included in any company gatherings. The supervisors would tell you one thing and do another. They told me that I would become permanent and then I never got the position. Supervisors would always go and say good morning to the regular employees, but never the contractors. I can't speak for the entire SunTrust Bank, but the department I was in was just unprofessional and had extreme favoritism. The most I enjoyed about working at SunTrust was the ease of my job, but the hardest was not being recognized for your good efforts and loyalty."
bad,"I was in the Memphis, TN region and SunTrust had fairly good market share and reputation in that city. Decisions made locally for the most part but independent career advancement not good."
bad,Suntrust mortgage was a stressful job experience.Poor management and highly political. The entire management team was fired after my RIF. Could not recommend SunTrust  Mortgage
bad,"They tell you they want you to take care of the clients, but really no. "
bad,"The job started out with decent bonus potential, however, sales incentives were taken away, and upper management  seemed only concerned with their golf course dates and power lunches."
bad,"No work-life balance, no appreciation for a job well done, no opportunities for advancement based on merit, no telework optoins, no one was ever happy to be at work."
bad,It's STRESSFUL and we are disrespected by fellow colleagues/clients and some managers. I have learned a lot from the industry. The camaraderie with my team.
bad,Constant turnover of staff. Very little administrative support.Corporate focus would change every few months.Micro management and meetings for no reason.
bad,"Over worked, under appreciated...asked to do unethical things. The management is ruthless and relentless. They simply care nothing about the employees."
bad,Very numbers/sales driven. Understaffed and branches closing all over. Everybody is stressed because of goals that are impossible and upper management are like wolves. Definitely no work/ life balance. You will do great if you eat breathe sleep SunTrust and view each client as a number game.
bad,Worked here for years and advancing in your career is difficult and the compensation is terrible. If you are lucky if you get 2% increases a year even if you're a top performer. All they care about is making sure you're making you're goals and if you are the next month they want more. Most managers have no idea how the bank actually works and can't do anyone else's job. They expect you to make your goals and cover where you are needed and do not take into account that you've been doing someone else's job. Benefits aren't terrible it's the basic 2 weeks off and 1 week sick time. You do receive more maternity/paternity then most companies. Health insurance is average nothing great but nothing terrible.
bad,"I love the customer service portion of my job. The sales environment is very hard for me, as I am not a sales person. Lots of pressure is put on the employees to get referrals. With the amount of work I do, I feel I deserve more money."
bad,"There were many long hour days, with mandatory weekend overtime hours. Treated you like a work horse. Always made comments like we can replace you if you cant make the weekend overtime hours."
bad,"I was a client of SunTrust since 2004, always had this feeling I wanted to work here tellers and bankers looked friendly and helpful, but on Jan 2016 when I decided to join the company it was a different whole world behind that teller line and my biggest nightmare begun! To begin with technology is awful, is so outdated which makes a lot clerical errors and off balances, messy unreliable and let's not talk about their ridiculous sales goals they force people to open accounts literally! And let's not even talk about management honesty I don't know how they still are in business!"
bad,"SunTrust IT used to be a great place to work but the culture has changed and employees are no longer regarded as valuable but rather as commodities to be used."
bad,I came into the company with a very positive outlook and left very unhappy. There is no work life balance and upper management does not adjust the turn times according to the volume. They pile on more expectations every day and expect you to complete everything by week end. Each department is very divided and there is no unity. I walked into work every day having anxiety b/c of the work environment. If you do not like loan officers to run your desk this is not the place for you. It's unfortunate that I could not like this place.
bad,All the focus is on cutting cost and boosting stock price.  Management does whatever it taks to meet financial metrics and get bonuses.  No investment in IT.
bad,The job is highly stressful and employees are left frustrated and feel unappreciated. No matter how well you do it's never enough even when you meet and exceed managements expectations.
bad,"It is very difficult to be promoted, management only promote within their own friends, and personal relationships outside the Bank. If you are not in their group like for example their church you have little to none advancement opportunity."
bad,Good managers but dead end career path.  Benefits were below par.
bad,very unoraganized and the pay scale is horrible. Wouldn't recommend anyone work for SunTrust Mortgage Inc
bad,"1. The typical day was to focus on my clients and their financial         needs."
bad,"Typically at work I would speak to customers about their mortgage payments"
bad,"Just another number, the overwork you to make your goals and then raise the higher every year."
bad,"The company is changing and losing a lot of good people. "
bad,WLS is a total sweatshop.  The group has little to no upward mobility. Division is stock piled with micro-managers. The two years I spent there were basically a wasted 2 years of my life! 
bad,I was a client before becoming an employee. I've stop being a client since I became an employee. SunTrust just started outsourcing the majority of Customer Care overseas and has closed several branches. It's a good possibility that your job at SunTrust will be either eliminated or sent overseas.
bad,"Over 3000+ employees. I am lucky enough to enjoy my job and the staff I work with. There are tons of talented and hard working employees here. I enjoy the web development, graphic design and project management I do on a daily basis. I am involved with two large corporate initiatives; United Way and First Book. I look forward to volunteering for both these charities each year."
bad,9 years tenure. No fair promotions. Management has their favorites. Management has no idea what the investigators do on a daily basis. Very negative atmosphere. They constantly threaten to discontinue your telecommuting privileges. Very manual processes. Technology is terrible. SunTrust and BBT merger completed 12/7/19. Stay away from REG E and check fraud
bad,Management fails to lead and plays favourites with associates.  Management states they are willing to help and want to know the truth but when speaking freely your words are later used against you.
bad,"Fraud operations is Technically challenged with multiple manual tasks. suggestions for improvement are welcomed but never achieved and mostly ignored. managements behavior is childish, petty and unprofessional. It’s all about the numbers. Management wants unrealistic results. SunTrust is currently merging with BBT bank so a lot more stress in the environment currently."
bad,"I have been in customer service, Mortgage & banking for 33 years! I have only worked for 3 companies in my career and have never been treated as I was with Suntrust.  Worst  & most stressful environment I have ever worked in. Managers are allowed to slander the employees as well as take photos and speak to their employees as they feel!"
bad,The salary was very low but the benefits were really good. Did not have great management that wanted to help employees develop skills and grow. The branch did not have a manager for over 6 months and did not have any upper management support.
bad,"This review is only for the wholesale portion of Suntrust that doesn't exist anymore.  Rates were fantastic at this bank, however, the low rates meant high production that the bank wasn't set up to receive.  My time was spent mostly putting out fires and unable to spend the amount of time that I desired out in the field."
bad,"I am a huge fan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey's incoming I-banking cohort structure, building location, and quality of work.  I struggled with authentically feeling/being a part of the team.  Alumni allegiances among other stereotypes were much at play in my experience.  I would recommend regional investment banking analyst study hard, experience the analyst program, and move on."
bad,"During my time at SunTrust, I saw a lot of people leave for many reasons.  They lack quality management.  I have come to conclusion that you do not have to have any management experience.  They offer what appears to be a great compensation plan, but make it impossible for teammates to reach them.  Too much pressure to meet goals, always a consistent reminder that your job my be taken if you done meet minimum expectations.  Rather you have been with the company 1year or 15 years they can an will fire you over some of the most  Insignificant  thing."
bad,"I'd prefer not to comment much further than. It's not an environment I wish to continue to work for. Product pushers, bad staffing issues with high turn over for tellers. Personal bankers are not held accountable for their calls and say they do them when they really don't. Fast paced with little to no management support. All that is heard is push product to educate clientele when really they are turning into another Wells Fargo. Poor staffing for tellers, consistently short staffed, never enough help."
bad,"Unfortunately worked under a micro manager who"
bad,"Wonderful compensation package. However, the sales culture is extremely exacting with similar tendencies that caused Wells Fargo scrutiny. "
bad,"Too many managers to micromanage your day.  Daily meetings, weekly meetings, monthly meetings take away hours from actual productivity.  A lot of late night and weekend hours needed to keep up with demands."
bad,"SunTrust is a place where mediocrity thrives.  There are a few good leaders in the bank, but there are mainly managers who do not know what they are doing.  SunTrust was once described to me as a place that was hugely passive aggressive with a thin veneer of southern politeness.  "
bad,"I get left alone on my own a lot and I'm relatively new to the company and banking itself. People are quitting left and right in some areas due to shoddy area managers that do not perform their jobs or make sure their workers are covered. Outside of that, the customers are wonderful, though there are sometimes crazies."
bad,"The upper management and pay are both terrible. The best part about this is the 8-5, Monday-Friday schedule and plenty of holidays throughout the year to give you extra days off."
bad,"area manager is a complete joke, clueless as to the sales aspect and has no clue on how to handle branch managers, conference calls on a daily basis to discuss the same topics that was discuss before the last call."
bad,Culture is abusive and aggressive sales are key. Customer relationship development is only encouraged to sell. Management yelling and creaming during morning meetings is no way to encourage results.
bad,"Management is blinded by sales numbers. Thats all they seem to care about. Service is very poor. SunTrust is not what they used to be. Too many people from Wells Fargo are being hired and have brought that mentality with them. CEO is not the problem, It's the middle management thats the issue. They will not hesitate to stab anyone in the back if it means getting the position they want and move up the ladder."
bad,"I wanted to like SunTrust, I really did. "
bad,"The pay is really good, but have to be prepared to make your sells goals. The company focuses on micro-managing their employees. Be prepared to have someone standing behind you and coaching you on how to get referrals."
bad,"IT jobs are continuously being  outsourced especially on shore jobs. "
bad,"I thought I would be taking a job that would help me be home more with my family and allow me to grow my knowledge of money. The lack of full teams keeps people working more hours than promised in interviews. Also, the push to sell is more intense than working in a retail clothing setting."
bad,After working there for many years they became all about sales and not thinking about the clients needs.  They did not care about their employees at all.
bad,My team mates made the work enjoyable.  I had many hats and was looked upon as a hard worker and very knowledgeable. I learned a lot about banking having been in operations where you were considered the nucleus of the day to day functions. No time did I feel I was  unable to be productive and unable to fulfill my job to the fullest.  I was given the opportunity to advance.  I felt as though I was in a secure atmosphere.  The hardest part was being let go (RIF) without my full compensation.  You figure you put that much time into a company they would give you what you worked so hard for.
bad,"Day to day operations of a multi -million dollar Financial Institution Business development to include lines and loans. Focus on development for outside ST businesses.   Coach my team to meet client’s needs on a daily basis, to give clients everything they need and nothing they don’t. Exceeds individual goals monthly. Interview, hire, train. Assists with non managed branches to ensure clients’ needs met and that teams are mentored and coached. Interviewing, hiring, training of team to include for entire division for area 9 for all levels of team members: Tellers, Personal Bankers, CSS, Managers."
bad,"During my time as an HR Professional at this establishment, I found the management more concerned with how to do as little as possible ... rather than working smartly.  Which would have faired them better in the long-run."
bad,"Worst manager I have ever had in a 22 year career.  He left just prior to a general mutiny.  Enough said."
bad,"employees are paid a decent rate but company does not pay overtime for any reason - employees are forced to ""burn"" extra hours worked every couple of days"
bad,It's very hard to find a great manager at this company. All the GREAT ones are gone and WE wonder why?! Lightly their way to a better company!!!
bad,We were short of staff all the time and they change management 4 times in 1 year. They will give you hours when they need it and then cut it as soon they don't need you anymore. Really horrible place.
bad,"Since starting at SunTrust I have worn many hats which has allowed me to learn alot new things.  I started in the Foreclosure department preparing Affidavits and consulting with attorneys.  After that I moved over to the MERS department to assist them with their backlog.  I started as a QC reviewer then advanced to team lead then to supervisor.  We have coached a great team that worked diligently to help pull the department out of the red.  The department now has a successful flow and meets all our SLA's.  The hardest part of my job is working in a default department when the company no longer has a large default portfolio thanks in part to my teams hard work.  But, this means less workload for the team which may in turn cause a reduce in work force.  I am true believer that anyone can do anything if they have the right training and support.  I came into SunTrust with no mortgage experience at all and within 3 years time I rose all the way to a supervisor."
bad,"Conference calls, forecasting call volume, capacity planning, staffing, scheduling and Intraday ,monitoring"
bad,Lots of training that's always changing but the actual bank and equipment is out dated. Management leaves a lot to be desired unqualified.
bad,"I learned that you must keep your mind on yourself and be more aggressive with teammates and management.  A typical day was to come to work and try to catch up with the levels of services expected and go home with a feeling of not being able to complete everything on the agenda for that day.  My coworkers were just as afraid of management as I was so it was like we were baby sharks and when the Mom shark swam in the temperature in the water/room dropped.  My so called friends/teammates did take advantage of me because I encouraged it, I have now learned my lesson about turning the other cheek.  The hardest part of my job was that my managers did not get it and if I tried to speak my mind I was labeled as a trouble maker and usually ended up very emotional.  Sad to report I no longer enjoyed anything about my job I feel very blessed to no longer work at this company.  It's all about business, no more hurt feelings here."
bad,"My co-workers were great to work with.  They are very helpful and understanding. Management is very unconcerned about your wants and needs.  They try to manipulate you to thinking you are doing a bad job when you are not, they push for you to work harder, but yet constantly tell you how you are not a value to the company.  Everyday you are being bullied and harrassed.  Human Resources does not help  unless your time is being reported incorrectly, other than that, any other issues they brush off.  You are on your own, so if you find yourself in this situation, just let it roll off your shoulder or find another job outside of SunTrust."
bad,the management was abusive which made for an bad work environment
bad,I love working with all different types of people helping clients with their life needs and finding a solution to help them with any life changes that may occur.
bad,"Overwhelming work load not balanced"
bad,"No respect for the employees,  "
bad,I work for SunTrust in Columbus Georgia. I've been with the company for years. Management is very funny acting and they really do stick together regardless of if what they're doing is right or wrong. They have a very bad do as I say and not as I do mentality. Working under the area manager is a joke. He just let's his managers run all over him. Horrible place to work.
bad,"Typical day at work was very busy, which was good."
bad,"I have worked in banking my whole adult life. So coming here should have been just as nice...COMPLETELTY WRONG! SunTrust itself is a nice place, a little too sales driven but still nice. At first management & co-workers were nice..then the truth comes out. Just like highschool, there were the clix. It was horrible seeing & aggravating seeing these women act like 13 yr olds. Could not handle such fake personalities."
bad,"I have always enjoyed my jobs. They were all unique and completely different with respect to the type of work I had to do. From each of them I learned various procedures and complex issues on how to handle clients and cope with the day to day procedures of the job. Because of my warm and friendly personality, I have always maintained a good working relationship with my co-workers and management which makes the job more enjoyable and fun to work in such environment. The hardest part of the job is when I had to leave, not knowing if I would find other employment with good professional folks and great working ethics.."
bad,Long hours away from family with no recognition and low salary pay. Everyday employees live in fear of losing their jobs. Company promotes community but only pushes spending time with large dollar clients. Company is solely about the numbers.
bad,"Good place to work for, for 20 years I learned to be loyal to my compnay. Was a fun place to work for and loved my coworkers. My clients were my most enjoyable part of the day."
bad,Sales expectations are unreasonable in current climate and location.
bad,"A typical day was reviewing items for potential fraud with stringent deadlines, report preparation and data tracking. I enjoyed gathering data and report preparation for this department. I worked with very little supervision and strict deadlines for my reports."
bad,"I used to be proud to work for SunTrust, but over the past 2 years I have seen so many changes that have adversely affected clients and employees. There is no line of communication. Branches are closing and clients are finding out before teammates. Just not right. Also, mass layoffs with many crucial positions being eliminated. It makes working there tough and stressful."
bad,"Suntrust was a position when I came in as a basic teller and within a month & a half was given the head teller/coordinator position after the person originally giving the position resigned. For almost a year managed the teller line and admin duties for that particular branch with the promise of a promtion to higher position. The hardest part of the position were the six day work weeks at a branch not close to my home. Per management, they did the best they could according to the circumstances, however when the person hired to replace me was not progressing which held up me being promoted the work environment became tense causing tensions and my leaving the position."
bad,"I've been with SunTrust for nearly 5 years. At my first location, I went through 3 managers in less than 4 years. At my current location I'm working with a direct supervisor from ****. SunTrust asks its employees to commit each week to sales numbers that are unattainable and ridiculous. The bank's customer satisfaction surveys are stupid and arbitrary and count against you if one customer doesn't think you care enough about them. REALLY? Inaccurate, or no, communication abounds, especially for employees working less than 25 hrs/wk. Employees are reprimanded like children.The managers are untrained and don't know how to motivate staff. Pay is all over the place. New hires coming in now are making less than I did when I started. ST is also cheap in equipment and software. My advice is to stay away from ST and, in fact, stay away from all banks. None of them care about their employees right now."
bad,Sales driven environment with no associate development.
bad,"Take inbound calls from current customer and potential customers."
bad,"SunTrust is like all other banks, they want you to do nothing but sell. They don’t care if you give customers accounts they do not need just make sales to make goals. Constantly hounded to sell any products to the customers you see every single day."
bad,they just want bodies to fill the call center. they don’t care about you as a person. but you’ll make decent money... if you’ll put up with verbal abuse from the customers and the other employees.
bad,"Very slow paced environment. Company hires very low skilled employees in order to pay them nothing . Hours of operation are good from 9am to 5pm, benefits are ok , not the best and compensation is very low."
bad,"Needs to focus on reinventing the work culture to promote innovation.   Troubling level of cronyism, cliques and trolling. Not a meritocracy by an means. Employees do care about a positive customer experience."
bad,Pay is good bonus is good I did they have to many new people coming in and out the just merged with bbt so things may be different I did not work there long
bad,The work hours was horrendous. Open 7 days a week no work life balance. Compensation was just ok. Benefits were great. Management did not mentor staff.
bad,SunTrust is a large and established company. This can offer you some options if you want to expand your career. They are not good to their established employees. People often leave and come back in order to get a higher salary.
bad,"There was little opportunity for advancement, they almost always hired from outside. No training outside your immediate job. Little job security as they moved departments to other areas or overseas. Benefits were okay but decreased over time. Not a recession proof job."
bad,Typical undegrad program so not much to say.  My first job out of college and a learning experience in middle market lending and credit underwriting skills.
bad,"I worked for SunTrust Bank  form winter of 2013 until I was laid off this year spring of 2018. They decided to outsource the dept I was in to India. The dept was a close group of people with it's employees being there for years. It was so sad the way that they got rid of everyone and took our health benefits they day we were terminated along with low severance packages. Several other departments were laid off as well. I no longer wish to work for a bank, or at least not for SunTrust for that matter."
bad,Lack of knowledge and clients are irate due to reps having lack of knowledge of the products that suntrust offers. Managers are stressed out and unable to meet the needs of the employees and it becomes a domino effect
bad,managent was rude and unethical.  Was a very hostile environment if you had the wrong manager.   Products were decent and sales were hard and you were threatenened with your job
bad,"Sometimes less work life balance and more unnecessary pressure. Bureaucrat atmosphere prevails in many departments. Overall, okay to work in this environment."
bad,"When I first started at SunTrust they were great, they cared about the employees but after 5 years they started to try to become a Wells Fargo and got too big too fast and the numbers were all that they cared about."
bad,"Unfortunately my time at Sun Trust was not the most constructive. Their leadership structure, and their micro management of every situation, especially sales, made it very stressful and difficult to continue working under that umbrella."
bad,"•	Handling billing inquiries and service requests"
bad,"A typical day at work was taxing, with most days back to back on inbound phone calls. I learned to multitask quickly on the dual monitors, and applications. Direct management did their best, but not always available for help. Friendly workplace, but sour environment due to stress of job. The hardest part being the account maturities and contract management. The Most enjoyable part was seeing co-workers each day, and coffee."
bad,"Have worked here for over 15 years. Have never seen so many people laid off right before Christmas (and at a time when profits are through the roof.) They have invested in ""robots"" which has resulted in a drastic  reduction in the workforce. Glaring gender wage gap discrepancy.  They announced raises (due to the new tax legislation) but in reality, they RIFed hundreds of people--people who have worked for the company for 20 plus years--to pay for them. But no worries, the upper level management tier has rewarded themselves handsomely. Guess if you're a shareholder, this is good news. For the rest of us who have a modicum of humanity, this company will use you up and spit you out."
bad,"SunTrust has a lot of good things going for it, but until they figure out how to hire more staff, avoid this place. I have worked at several branches at another bank and I have never seen anything more unorganized. Understaffing is an UNDERSTATEMENT."
bad,"Corporate policies do not differentiate based on regional demographics and culture, making it difficult to adhere and be successful in a rural environment."
bad,"Poor leadership/management. Southern ""good ole boy""  organization with strong anti-semitic hiring and advancement practices. Technology 3 years behind the curve."
bad,"it was face pace, you have to key acct number very fast and they rate you on how much you do per day.  Every month they do review with you.  After training only have 3 month to reach what they are looking for."
bad,Work did not provide essential benefits.  Nice locations. Very well known banking institution and respected within the banking industry.  Unfortunately did offer enough benefits for it's employees.
bad,"Got caught in the 2008 meltdown and the culture dramatically changed for thee worse.  Was asked to run central Florida and ""clean up the mess"" that had been made."
bad,SunTrust is a very stressful environment to work in due to the product up selling and goals you must reach. SunTrust often gets  new staff and managers that do not have a lot of experience. Furthermore you work on very dated systems.
bad,"When I initially was hired, I really enjoyed the job but as the work load became heavier and there were more duties being added to the daily work.  We were not compensated for it and the company went under a company reconstruction and it was no longer desirable to work there. I don't mind challenges and change, if I was being compensated for the change and additional duties."
bad,"I went into this job knowing that this was going to be temporary. They offer fantastic benefits as far as health, dental, vision, and vacation days. However, the senior management involved in the Client Contact Center is terrible, there are changes all the time that just make the job harder. I believe some of the expectations are unrealistic. There are little to no career advancements without having to relocate completely."
bad,Assisted current and potential clients w/ banking needs and services.  Utilized customer service expertise to interact with customers to provide information in response to inquiries about products or services.  Suggested and sold new products to current and potential clients.
bad,If a new employee came into the department they will promote them instead on employees with much more time. I endured three years of horrible Harassment. The pay rate changed and my supervisor would not change my salary.
bad,Culture is very intimidating. Feel like someone's always looking over your shoulder even if you are exceeding expectations. Horrible environment for advancement.
bad,"Lack of concern for employees trickled down from management.  The main objective of the company was to hit sales goals.  Often, ethics were overlooked to achieve the numbers at the end of the day."
bad,"A typical day would be opening the branch, handling all banking transactions for clients, balancing all monies collected, processing transactions, performing closing procedures. I learned that I was not a good fit in the banking workplace culture. The hardest part of the job was being forced to meet goals through sales referrals that were presented to every customer that I assisted at my teller window. Customers were generally annoyed when I was required to present them a sales offer of our products. I was also required to stand whenever I was working with a customer. I was not allowed to sit while I had a customer at my window. It was expected of me to handle both the inside teller station and the drive thru at the same time. Very stressful and exhausting, never had enough staff to cover the needs of the business. The one enjoyable thing that I can say was getting to know my regular customers."
bad,"Roughly 20 years ago SunTrust was the place to work! The large amount of turnover that most regions have experienced is due to the  management they keep hiring and promoting into lead positions. The top of the house management keeps changing every 3-4 years which in turn brings more chaos and a different set of ""what is most important"" focus. Unfortunately they have developed a reputation of inconsistency and constant change and most business owners can't trust the stability of the company. Management is the sole reason Commercial/Business Banking and Treasury have suffered so much in recent years. They need to clean house once and for all and start over. Management should be about positively guiding, motivating, developing and supporting employees rather than talking down to, pressuring, constantly changing their minds and intimidating employees. A real shame how far they have fallen."
bad,I am grateful for the opportunity with Suntrust but management was awful and it was quickly a turn off from the company. I was moved around to different branches all the time basically being given no option or direction. A lot of unethical business. Too messy for me. I truly hope management gets better!
bad,"I managed over 5 branches"
bad,"Working with Suntrust was an enjoyable experience.  I learned flood determinations of mapped ins and mapped outs.  I did data entry and research for this company.  I did not have to worry about answering phone calls and make out outbound calls hardly."
bad,"SunTrust is unfortunately a very disorganized company. I was ready to retire with them however, it is about favoritism and not the quality of the person or about the work you do. As with most corporate environments, they cut positions all of the time, move you around from job to job, and set you up for failure."
bad,"You are expected to sell, sell, sell! No matter who comes in you are expected to pitch some additional sale. High pressure to perform. You do get to work great hours as a banker."
bad,"Worked for ST for a decade now...  Consistently a top performer in each role they've asked me to perform."
bad,Executive management only cares about their numbers with very little interest in individual growth or transparency to their team
bad,"Its ok if you are just getting into this field. Little advancement, bonus is little to nothing $1200 per quarter...upper management only cares about numbers!"
bad,This was a sales job where the pay was commission based only. I was advised that I was be provided with great leads but was not. Very hard to sale policies
bad,"I did not agree with management. Unprofessional, and non responsive. The Loan officers were rude, and their new processing system was rolled out with many flaws."
bad,worked in retail very stressful loan officers were bullies management will lie to you and say anything to make things sound good the closer role is the most important lowest paid and treated with lowest respect people their look out for their friends or whoever kisses managements rear most loans were rushes and did not have proper documents to complete packages very unorganized and cliquish on the cd department the management was very micromanaged and not able to assist with any questions
bad,"Very poor environment, low class, low education of all personal including boss and co-workers, busy incoming calls, good opportunity to earn money from commissions"
bad,"Worked during high school, great culture. This was just a quick opportunity to get some cash. Worked as a cashier, customer service and any assistance needed I was available to offer."
bad,Premium Assignment does not like to promote their current employees. This is a good place to work temporarily but if you want to advance within the company don't bother. They also don't pay well.
bad,this company is unethical and has micromanaging down to an art. they do not trust their employees and do not promote a comfortable work environment
bad,"This was a temporary assignment which I accepted after a period of being laid off."
bad,SunTrust itself seemed like a great company to work for but their management skills were not up to par. All the branches I have associated with always had employees not pulling their weight so it would fall on everyone elses shoulders.
bad,Very sales and  goal oriented.   Work more hrs then hired for.  Every other week some of us  work 6 days.  Me included.    No balance between work and family life.   Very stressful job not enough help left working on  your own on a teller line .   No a good place to work.
bad,"Been here for 10 years, time to move on.  Senior Management is disconnected from employees."
bad,SunTrust is a very disorganized company. Policies vary branch to branch. Information is nearly impossible to find. Back office support is non-existent. Management cares very little for careers or advancement of employees. Vacation time is not competitive compared industry standards. The hours are hard to beat and the pay is competitive but I would not recommend the company for anyone serious about their career.
bad,"Too many jobs lost due to outsourcing to India.  Very stressful job, all emphasis on production."
bad,"Everyday is a continuous barrage of demands to sale whatever product the area managers needs to make his numbers look better. This results in lower branch sales production, because employees are always trying to survive that day by chasing a sale and not selling solutions."
bad,I enjoyed working with the LOBs and developing controls and finding risks within their line of business
bad,An average day at a SunTrust in-store consists of mostly teller transactions while also opening accounts and having conversations with clients to help with loan needs.
bad,Is really hard to work under pressure with so little guidance
bad,very limited communication from management.  responsible for entire 3 state area.
bad,called people all day trying to get them to get credit cards.
bad,"Never again. Good Company, bad management. Management needs more training, ethical, managerial and code of conduct training"
bad,"Ive worked at better places and worse places.  The pay is not good, the chance for advancement is virtually non-existent.  They are light years behind on technology.  The working hours were wonderful though."
bad,"assisted customer with their accounts (balances, overdrawn fees, and referred other products)"
bad,SunTrust taught time me a lot and I loved the hands on time I was able to spend with clients. I loved how the company developed me and gave me large range of financial knowledge.
bad,"A day at SunTrust consisted of using my brain on a consistent basis, the workload was heavy and we had to be able to adapt to changes in our day to day routine. It was fun at times but we always had to be on top of things."
bad,Significant pressure to save money and an inexperienced CIO and new senior management team have create significant turmoil and uncertainty in IT. Dramatic increases in IT outsourcing is contributing as well . The IT culture is very unhealthy so after 13 years I have decided to leave the company.
bad,Took calls from clients about there mortgage and there escrow on there accounts
bad,fun friendly fast pased work environment
bad,"I love my co workers we have become like family, a typical day for me at work is all over the place and it is not structured and has become confusing."
bad,"No talent management whatsoever, skilled and talented people are pushed aside or forced out regularly in favor of boot lickers with no skills. Nine out of the 10 top talented people I knew at the company either left frustrated or were pushed out. I had 4 direct managers plus an additional three others that at any time could re-prioritize my work and of course they never communicated with each other because they all hated each other. There is constant infighting and bickering and politicking."
bad,"I nearly hated every minute of working for this company. My problem wasn't with the customers or even with management most of the time, it was with the way that Corporate chose to conduct itself and it's attitude and expectations of it's retail line of business. You will be handed outrageous goals because the company is very near to going under, there have been rumors for years they are going to get bought out. They have no desire to actually service the customer in the best way they can, just to service the customer in a way that will generate them the most amount of revenue, regardless of if the client actually needs the product being sold to them. I was disgusted, and put under constant pressure on a daily basis to refer all clients to products they were not interested in. I found it degrading, and stressful. I would never work for them again. Stay away if you have any desire to truly help people in a way that suits their needs."
bad,It is an ok company overall i enjoyed working and it was a great opportnunity i just left due to school at the time and my schedule was a big conflict.
bad,Management only push but do not work to help the branch goals.  Branch Manager in my branch doesn't do anything but make meeting everyday to push sells goals and always expecting the bankers do it all.
bad,"When I was working at suntrust, it felt like i took a step back 20 years. All their technology and software was outdates, i do know they're currently working on improving things so i might be better now. All they care about as a bank, naturally is to bring more customers with money at the bank. Area managers were very pushy on us to open more accounts etc."
bad,Most days are stressful but not overwhelming. It is a great place to build client relationships. It is a sales job. There are monthly goals that are required in order to be successful. You must get so many sales to get a good quarterly performance review. Upper management pushes you through your manager to meet these goals with little direction.
bad,Was not a great environment to work in as a financial advisor. Lots of sale pressure. All about commissions and not a lot of care about what the clients needed.
bad,The company seems to be more concerned with keeping their management employees happy and ensuring their job security than to investigating how management is treating its employees. No guidance or proper training for certain job positions are provided. Training is not hands-on but self-guided thru web training.
bad,Good organization but unfortunately management is working through a huge shift in procedures that is more focused on the shareholders than the clients. Makes it very difficult to do your job in the best interest of the clients.
bad,Its had great benefits but horrible management in certain branches. High turn over rate due to this sadly I don't see myself staying long like a lot of people in the area.
bad,Been employed for over a year and the training and initial work environment was excellent. Then you realize it is all too good to be true. The upper management look at employees as a tick mark on a spreadsheet. They care more about sales and hitting unrealistic sales goals then about the “purpose” that we are supposed to stand for. It would be a great job if there was less pressure on sales and more on genuinely caring about the clients
bad,"If you have a Bachelor's degree, don't do it. You are way underpaid and you cannot use your voice. You are expected to follow orders and not have an opinion."
bad,"A typical day at work involves at least 1 morning meeting, depending on the project schedule.  Sometimes there are several meetings a day.  Management at SunTrust is in a constant state of flux, as such, directions are constantly changing.  The culture is hard to describe.  SunTrust is conservative in it's approach to innovation and typically slow to compensate talent.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of direction.  The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the co-workers.  There are great people in the trenches, making SunTrust go.  Overall, in my own experience, what I've learned at SunTrust is that hard work will rarely get rewarded."
bad,The consistent management changes have stifled just about every department of the company. Trying to champion new ideas and directions ultimately turn out to be a flop. It has become extremely cut throat in internally and there is no sense of cohesiveness.
bad,I would receive accolades for doing my job as per my training on a weekly basis. My customers gave me high points. Management threatened to write me up for not meeting sales quota regardless of my exemplary performance.
bad,"The work was very repetitive, didn't really get an opportunity to showcase my talent. Management was really demanding with what was limited in the store to achieve goals"
bad,"I enjoy working for SUNTRUST.  I don't agree with some of the sales strategies they enforce on us to do.  I feel like I'm forced to have clients open things they don't need sometimes.  Very hard to make monthly goals and when you start making them, they make it even hard by changing it up in the middle of the month or quarter.  I enjoy client interaction and helping them with their finances."
bad,"SunTrust as a whole, to me, does not see you as an employee. They only see you based on how much money you can make them. The hardest part of the job itself is referring products, which is all the company really cares about."
bad,"Too much turnover, numerous 'old time' employees no longer there. Too inconsistent with staff. No one trusts upper management..they either leave or get let go"
bad,"Some higher up managers did not have your back. It was said by one mgr for us to be sure to spend time with family but with so much OT, due to not enough staff, this was not possible. I'm glad to have moved on from this place & enjoying the sunshine."
bad,The company was good to work for but there were issues with opportunity for advancement. I noticed a lot of people had been in the same position for years with no new opportunity presented to them.
bad,"This Company doesn't recognize great employees. Co-workers will work in a collaborative effort to obtain common work goals. The hardest part of the job is month end deadlines, quarterly deadlines, and year-end deadlines."
bad,A typical day at work is being pressured by your direct manager  and upper management for numbers core products. Sadly these demands are both unfair to both employees and even worse to our customers.
bad,Loved helping people make smart advancements with their hard earned money. Benefits of being able to advance were hard but worth the hard work.
bad,It's a good working environment.. The promotions is pending on who you know and how you fit in. Not your experience and education.
bad,"Greet candidates at windows. "
bad,"They are very cheap, and will say or do almost anything to avoid giving significant raises. If you decide to work for them, make sure you get a perfect offer going in, because you will not be getting many raises once you're there."
bad,The corporate culture was not what I'd expected from a company that focuses so heavily on their clients' financial well-being.
bad,"Working at SunTrust out of college was an experience. It afforded me the opportunity to learn and grow both personally and professionally. Additionally, the company has a good tuition reimbursement policy that enabled me to obtain my masters degree part-time while working full-time."
bad,"Run away from this company, this company's financial performance and poor culture have produced a company and workforce that is headed on a downward spiral."
bad,Banking is always evolving and ever changing. I have been in banking for eight years and have learned many things within this time frame. There really is not a typical day in banking. You have to adapt to clients personalities and needs. You are their banker and financial counselor. I am excited and open to new and challenging opportunities.
bad,Suntrust Mortgage is  a great company to work for.  My only concerned was the company promoted inviduals with no education verses individuals with education.
bad,"management very unhelpful unless your ""one of the guys"".  Unorganized and support staff worthless. While other banks were closing loans in 45-60 days Suntrust was taking up to 1 year in some cases causing me to lose a lot of income due to horrible customer service which management always came back and put on it's loan officers. When first started was told in the very inadequate training class that ""we do not hold your hand at Suntrust"" even though they changed how things operated on a monthly basis so the loan officers have no idea things changed unless we figured it out on our own."
bad,"SunTrust is about sales and nothing more, at least on the banking floor. They do participate in a customer satisfaction survey and hold employees accountable for it, but they are primarily focused on production. Expect several daily calls to report how many checking accounts you have opened, and if you haven't met goals, be prepared to discuss how you will. If you don't meet your goal (which is not always reasonable,) you can be written up & subject to termination. This goes for tellers as well. Also, should you try to talk to HR about any issue, you will be referred back to your manager and district manager. HR is not there to serve you, their interests are very clearly with the bank only. Employee contribution is not sincerely appreciated with this company."
bad,I love sales and have been the mortgage industry for almost 20 yrs but want a new challenge in a different industry . I look forward to that challenge and being able to bring my extensive sales experience along with superior customer service to my new employer.
bad,Great customers but unrealistic management.  Management had too many conference call about production instead of letting employees be productive.
bad,"I had heard good things about SunTrust prior to accepting a job with them.  I heard the culture was good, the management was supportive, and that I had an opportunity for advancement within the bank.  I ended up finding out the hard way that none of this was the case.  Sure I put in a 40 hr workweek with little to no stress, but this was mostly because there was simply no work to do.  They hired a bunch of us to clean out a pipeline of HARP loans and then lay us off just in time for the holidays as a christmas present.  Nice job by management.  Sure they promised the chance to obtain your DE(for people who do not know what this is it is a certification to underwrite FHA loans which is VERY helpful in the mortgage industry) That was yanked within a month of a bunch of us getting there.  I should have seen the writing on the wall when lending authority increases were taken away. This company defines what corporate america is all about.  I must say that the harsh lesson learned is that you need to get things in writing when negotiating with SunTrust if you are in the process of obtaining employment with them.  Listen hard on conference calls to find out if there is a layoff in the cards as they leave subtle clues.  I will end it with this.  I do not recommend this company to anyone.  If I were to take a positive out of this dreadful experience.  Some of my co workers were great people and my heart is with them in hoping they are able to obtain employment."
bad,"If your not in managements little group, you are considered an outsider. I enjoyed my work, I just didn't like the way I was micro managed."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of returning calls to clients to de-escalate payments and research issues on a daily basis. To maintain workload and and have a deadline to complete tasks in a timely manner. Hardest part of the job was to learn how to adept to various working environments and personalities. The most enjoyable part of the job once trained, to be known as the ""go to person "" to get the job done, take ownership, and to be recognized for it."
bad,Overworked and under appreciated.  Hard work unnoticed.  More praise goes to those who cheat the system to meet their referral goals.  Feel like a number and they really do not care about advancement.
bad,Originated secondary loans for residential property.  Loved interacting with customers and making their dreams of home ownership a reality. I learned how to originate and perform as a loan officer through company based training.
bad,If you are new on the scene you can be treated rudely by some of the customers because you don't know them on a personal basis. This may not be the case at all locations. I will say that my cash handling experience and confidence increased.
bad,The job description says Teller BUT you will be PUSHED to sale products you have a goal you must meet each day and you will be wriiten up if the goal is not met. Lobby management when you stand all day watching customers walk in and out. Horrible place to work
bad,Prefer working in a traditional branch. Working an instore location you do not close until 7pm then have to do the closing procedures so you get home even later.
bad,The people are great to work with. They do have good benefits. Managers not willing to help when asking questions. The goals set to reach are our side of the reach of most employees
bad,"The benefits and pay are good for the entry level position but you will be expected to meet sales metrics under the guise of ""meeting client needs"" in every department until you advance to a supervisor position. The job is pitched as simply a customer support position but your advancement depends on how well you meet sales goals. Customers are typically very upset and at times can be downright abusive, and there is no recourse for a teammate to do anything other than ignore the abuse and continue, even escalating up to a supervisor can be considered a punishable offense and you may be placed on ""corrective action."""
bad,Salary and benefits are good work life balance could be better. On site cafe is good for convenience. Fun activities throughout the year for all departments.
bad,"they want you to be ethical but at the same time demand you get everything out of there customers even if they don't need it ."
bad,"The banking industry was going through a great deal of change when I worked at SunTrust.  Rules were being rewritten and all employees were just trying to keep pace.  SunTrust encouraged a collaborative environment between commercial, wealth management and business bankers.  That was very positive.  Mortgage managers in Sales and in operations were less than inspiring.  Individuals and their contributions, made the mortgage team go."
bad,"I learned to manage stress and keep my questions, concerns or opinions to myself * some people advanced to managers were not qualified and it showed. They were not good communicators"
bad,"Very uncomfortable working environment.  I knew going in that SunTrust had their issues, but I was completely caught of guard at how bad the environment was Lower level employees are treated fairly, but the higher you get the more problematic that Bank becomes."
bad,"SunTrust is turning into a company that cares more for meeting certain quotas than making sure their employees are well taken care of and happy."
bad,"Reviewing workflow tracker, client voicemail and email messages.  Managing Client sensitive data through internal and governmental tools.  Direct management is inexperienced Sr. Leadership was professional.  Workplace culture is very cutthroat.  Hardest part of my job fixing problems created by others.  Most enjoyable part of the job, the work from home privilege."
bad,The schedules are assigned at random and can't be changed at all.  They are very strict about adhering to the schedule to the minute.  So if you're a minute off its going to count against you.  No control over anything.
bad,"long hours, heavy sales and quotas are sugar coated with other names like clients helped, financial confidence. (maybe we need to review 2014 Fed settlement). poor management. heavy favoritism and discrimination with full support from HR and regional management. minimal to poor training and is forced to learn it while you work. get your experience get out."
bad,"The company is very traditional. Although the company claims to want change, leadership support is not provided to enable true change, unless required for operations."
bad,"70 sales and 30 percent service, learned a lot about finance and banking, management is very different and quick to make huge changes in a heart beat, work place is very dated still using devices from the 80s, the job is very easy mostly sales and appt setting followed by referrals to other depts, the most enjoyable part is to help people with their finances and teach about banking."
bad,A typical day at work was keying in the data needed. I learned the inner workings of banks mailing system. The management was stern. The workplace culture was diverse as there were many different persons employed. The hardest part of the job was not making mistakes on your work. The most enjoyable was management treating you to lunch.
bad,Expect to work from sun up to sun down. Make sure to ask alot of questions from superior and to attend trainings.Not good on grqining before just tossing you out there to find your way in the mix.
bad,"Lots of empty suits walking around. The company is the epitome of corporate America. No one knows who to talk to, there is very little accountability, and the organization is constantly being rearranged with higher turnover than usual. Think of the show ""The Office"" but banking. The compensation is great, above market, however the company does not invest in new technology to keep up with its competitors."
bad,"Poorly managed, not staffed well, and unsatisfactory place to work, not good communication, needs more prompt leadership, people were good to work with but it contained a lot of drama as well"
bad,Seemed to have been a lack of communication from top to bottom as well as from bottom to top. Also seemed as if we were all working towards different goals.
bad,"Love my job but the management team is really low quality.  They don't care about your feelings, give you attitude no matter what, and it is like walking on egg shells.  Apparently they want you to give the best customer service but they don't care if they do which is embarrassing.  Like I said I love the job but I hate working with unprofessional people."
bad,"Expected to work many hours as a full-time employee after regular business hours and weekends without compensation."
bad,"My job is to sell 100% of the time. If the business isn't walking in, I am on the phone. The daily goals have to be met so I do what I have to do to make it happen. High stress job that is focused on sales."
bad,"SunTrust has, in the past 8 months, gone from a company that wants to make sure that every customer is taken care of to the fullest extent, to a company that is pushing sales and extra accounts on people."
bad,"Where to begin... The Coworkers have been incredible, local management has been great with helping employees meet goals and working with employees with any areas they may need coaching in. With that being said, the upper management is a joke. They post things all the time about how they appreciate 'all of your hard work' yet they hire people off the street or from Well's Fargo, for more money than people who have worked there for years. The goals seem to change almost daily. They've turned the Teller role into a miserable sales job, and they came out and told us that the turnover rate for 2013 was 43%, yet they do nothing to try to fix it. I was lucky, I hit my goals and built some great relationships. However, I've seen far too many people fired or quit over the referral goals from Tellers/CSS that I would not recommend this company in any way."
bad,I was told during my interview that I would get proper training.....when I started my first week was just taking on line tests and getting passwords set up etc...I along with two other girls got 2 days of training but it was very hard to listen plus take notes plus watch the manager as she was plugging information.....they were under staffed and running a deadline and i did not receive proper training so they let me go
bad,"Great working with LBO managers. Department management disengaged, myopic and aloof. Poor or non existent communication with subordinates. Good people moved out, lackeys untouchable."
bad,"Unreal working expectations and completely disfunctional workplace. Many functions are done in a very out-dated and inefficient way because the company doesn't want to pony up the expenses to upgrade its systems that are from the 90's. It negatively impacts the client experience in big ways. One day you're told to do something one way and the next day they act like they never told you that and tell you that you should have been doing your job a different way. Management outside of the branch knows nothing about the dynamics of each branch and just expects the same type of production from everyone. "
bad,Staffing has been an on-going challenge for this area with significant turnover in the retail banking line of business. This ranges from teller positions to branch and senior managers.
bad,SunTrust Mortgage is a very diverse company. It employees numerous nationalities. Which inturn allows employees to experience different cultures and allows employees too learn different things.
bad,Make decisions to invest money and time without considering the impact......and constantly put down other employers who they should be supporting.
bad,"Dont like the way I ad to leave .let me work all day then called me into her office."
bad,"The retail side of the bank is a mess.  They'd rather force employees to open checking accounts for people that don't need them instead of doing what's right for the clients."
bad,"The company doesn't seem to know what direction they are heading. "
bad,"High stress, salary job with quotas, that always go higher than you can reach, with more stick than carrot when you do not meet them.   Atmosphere gets toxic after a while.   Cold calling is part of the job, and if you do not bring in accounts from the calls you can eventually get written up.    If you do well and have a great month congrats!! .... now do it again (quotas go up accordingly), and if you do not, the pressure mounts.  Rapidly."
bad,"Very cut throat and aggressive on the banking retail operation.  A typical day in the branch mainly assist clients troubleshoot account issues and cross sell other financial solutions. There are tools to help sales representative meet quarterly goals.  Employees are given scripts on how to sell products both on the teller & Flatform side.  If you  love selling  and don't mind cold calling then this is a great company to work for.  Full Time employees have great medical benefits, sicks days and dental. Base pay for Universal Banker is Average + comm."
bad,As employed with Suntrust the compensation was great I was able to pay bills with what I was making. What I wasn’t to pleased about with the job was the management and the lack of hands on coaching to assist you with getting to your goals and professionalism was horrible.
bad,"The push of product even if it was not good for the client was the hardest part of the job."
bad,"doesn't care about employees."
bad,Its a good way to start banking. Its has its perks there are good and bad days but its a job. It can be stressful sometimes if you don't have the right management team or employees behind you.
bad,Large regional bank that wants to become the next Wells Fargo. Not focused on the clients or on the employees and could do a better job with both of those things.
bad,"Company is good in terms of longevity."
bad,"Having the branch day go smoothly, and handle any concerns in the branch"
bad,My normal day at the job always depends on who's at work. If there is someone missing on the teller line my day will be on the line helping clients with there transaction and making sure I'm taking care of my clients the best way I know how. If I am working on the platform side I am helping clients with there financial well being by understanding what there goals are and helping them reach there financial goals and financial well being.
bad,"I currently Work as a Financial service Rep. Our Branch is located in a Safeway grocery store and we have to sell products and services to the clients in the aisle while they are shopping, perform regular teller duties and also handle mortgages, loans, credit card applications as well as maintain customers personal and business accounts."
bad,Very loan and deposit balance minded. You will be assigned sales goals and expectations for reaching them. My experience with SunTrust was not very good. Being a former banker and working in financial services in the past I was very disappointed in their processes and unstable management.
bad,If you're an external hire coming into management then you are good to go with moving up in the company and being compensated fairly. If you're coming in as entry level then get your experience and move on to another company as HR will find ways to justify not paying you mid point.
bad,A typical day is seeing what the goal is for that day and what needs to be prioritized. What i learn is that no day will be the same.  Management is present. I dont have much to say on that. They can make the environment what it is. Coworkers are a team player and good to work with. Hardest part is being perfect in everything. Not being recognized or rewarded for what you have done or accomplished.  Just being noticed and to help one grow without being overlooked.  Enjoyable part is having a manager that is fun and likes to laugh.
bad,"They don't care about the employees, it's a very competitive environment"
bad,"Trust is the basic tenant for all relationships, so building an environment of trust is one of the most important things you can do to create a positive work environment. It's a philosophy that must be demonstrated."
bad,"A very high, intense, stressful work atmosphere as the company put more focus on profits rather than assisting clients on their financial needs. I worked in low pace area and it was difficult to upkeep the daily objectives the company pressed for from their employees"
bad,"Good company with great benefits. Management needs an overhaul. Everyone seems to be out for themselves and there is a real heavy sell culture. Make your sales, or sod not advance."
bad,work culture is highly decentralized with a very confusing organization chart.  it's hard to know what people do and what value they add to the company.  it is my opinion that people are resistant to change or documenting anything.
bad,"Workload consisted of planning and developing cross channel and media integrated plan (direct mail, email, online) for each campaign. Developed long term strategic marketing plan for supporting revenue goals of Retail, Commercial and Wealth Management business units."
bad,You are not paid the property salary for this company. You do way more work than you're paid for. Overtime is always needed in order to help pay my bills and it's overly stressful in this environment
bad,"Suntrust should have been a great place to work. But, if you weren't in one of their ""clicks"" you were not treated the same as the rest of those people that were."
bad,Got to my desk and prepared for the day ahead.  Got on the phone and assisted customers with questions on their modification loans.  Learned how to do modifications.  The management needed to be more involved in the problems that occurred when the customer applications had problems that the HPCR didn't have the knowledge or power to do anything to help the customer.  The hardest part of the job was sitting all day and dealing with the stress of customers not getting the help that they needed. The enjoyable part was making friends and being with a group of people that could help and relate with the everyday challenges of the job.
bad,"With my 6 years at Suntrust, it was overall a good experience.  It was my best experience with management and am thankful for my experience there."
bad,"My synopsis of banking in general is that it is trending to be more about the bottom line than customer satisfaction. I enjoyed my job while it is was still about the client. However, lately I have become disenchanted with the way at which the company drives it sales approach; which is basically get as much as you can from evrey client every time. I am still with Suntrust but am looking to transition to slightly different profession that can utilize my experience and knowledge of benefits, financials, and great interpersonal skills. I thoroughly enjoyed my teammates and the day to day part of banking along with some wonderful customers. My manager was committed to professionalism and that made a great difference with the office atmosphere. The challenging part ( and the reason that I am looking for a transition) is that upper level management is raising expectations on a monthly basis to an unattainable degree. It is to the point now that your job is measured on that monthly basis holding your job over you if your performance does not exceed your goals. In my opinion, that is not how I would motivate my staff nor how I have in the past as an assistant manager or team leader."
bad,The work was good but management was very cliquey. It has gotten a lot worse since I left there. I hear they treat the employees horrible and are very difficult to work with when trying to schedule vacation time. Not sure I would go back to work for them.
bad,"I have the ability to inspire teams to continue to perform under tight deadlines and with limited resources. I am able to clearly set expectations for both customers and resources. I believe that one provides excellent customer service – not by saying “Yes” but saying “No, but we can…”"
bad,Strong management.
bad,"I worked at the downtown Lynchburg location before it closed down. The training the give you is behind the times, very dated. If your not already in banking this is not the place to start! I worked with a weird bunch I’m glad I don’t have to see them people anymore."
bad,"Although there is opportunity for movement within the bank (good for upward movement, bad for trying to finish a project, work, etc.) the overall culture has been very shaky over the past several months. This most likely is related to the merger activities. Current management in my area of the bank is condecending, non-inclusive and non-responsive."
bad,Provided genuine customer service to the bank’s clientele while processing their transactions in an efficient and timely manner. The manager was not a good leader.
bad,"Decent job, with great pay. But lacks on communication company wide, was laid off due to miscommunication between employees. Was not satisfied with lack of compassion."
bad,SunTrust Bank had a short term mission but moved its targets often which made it difficult to accomplish the goal.  The organization seemed to shift focus quarterly based on the immediate need of the overall bank.
bad,"A typical day at work would depend on which area within the bank that you work in.  I was empowered to lead the initiative to transform the wholesale lending division.  In leading that effort, I created standard meetings with standard formats for reporting progress/status. This provided more efficiency within the program and minimized wasted time in meetings."
bad,"Responsible for tellers under me."
bad,Suntrust is overall a good bank but the management however is terrible ! There is favoritism between management and some of the staff. There are always problems
bad,I provided the service of taking mortgage payments for first time home buyers as well as refinancing consumers. I processed credit card payments for credit reports and other mortgage documents needed to process loan paper work.
bad,Suntrust is great at training their employees to become successful in the financial world. It allowed me to become organized and to listen clients instead of hearing them.
bad,"Been with the company almost 10 yrs. Loved my job until 2012, when they restructured everything and lost teammate appreciation and started focusing only on numbers."
bad,the bank is for special people. suntrust is not a bad company it just wasn't  for me . its for people who can sell things and get accounts
bad,"They knew way in advance that we do not have enough people to complete the required jobs that were on hand.  Insisted on that we break laws and requirements due to lack of manpower.  And if were taken to court, then we were blamed.  People were actually fired for the mistakes that they made us make."
bad,"Typically worked an 8hr day. All work was very routine and became mundane. New  branch manager was very difficult to work (very condescending & demeaning) for, which made the day stressful. My co-workers were nice and hardworking. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the clients achieve their goals."
bad,To much Drama from other co workers. The Area Management and Higher up is great but their are a couple of peers that ruin it for the others.
bad,"SunTrust does not value their employees, and are looking to makea  quick buck prior to thinking of customers or staff."
bad,great company to work for. work very hard and stay productive
bad,Well lighted work environment.  Most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I'd produced a good product.
bad,I was able to learn more about Microsoft Office and mainly worked with spreadsheets most of the day.
bad,typical sub-prime lender.  policies were bent for certain loan officers.
bad,"Atlanta-based SunTrust enjoys leading positions in some of the most attractive markets in the United States and also serves clients in selected markets nationally. The Company’s mission is to help people and institutions prosper by providing financial services that meet the needs, exceed the expectations, and enhance the lives of our clients, communities, colleagues, and ultimately our shareholders. "
bad,My typical work day was good. i came to work and processed credit disputes
bad,Suntrust is really cares about their clients and employees. This was a great company to work for.  
bad,I only studied for my securities licenses in this position. The company sponsored me and allowed me the private time to study. Great location in the middle of downtown.
bad,The job was great but the manager was not a great asset to the company.
bad,"Banking financial call center, answered customer concerns when they called into the 800 number"
bad,A typical day at work would consist of assisting clients by initiating claims for unauthorized charges in attempts to recover their funds.
bad,"I worked with bank customers in a call center, I also provided cross selling, there were matrix associated with center goals."
bad,Great work-life balance. Good management. Less learning opportunities. Should provide more growth opportunities to employee. Follows strict hierarchies
bad,"I enjoyed the company, it was challenging to close loans on time, which was impacting my paycheck and reputation. Guidelines were strict with the back."
bad,"Slow pace, non challenging call center environment. Only worked there one year. Recommend this position for those just exiting high school. There is not much opportunity for growth."
bad,Suntrust has gone downhill. They used to be a very good company to work for and now everyone seems to dread coming to work. I personally had a bad experience with a manager who made my job hell. Banking is taking a new direction and its more beneficial to computers than it is to people.
bad,"Way too many goals and quotas that needed to be met, a close to impossible amount. Lots of favoritism that goes on. A lot of micromanagement. Not enough support as far as being able to hang up calls once a client becomes highly offensive and irate."
bad,"The job itself is not terribly difficult or challenging, for someone with as much customer service experience as myself.  The computer hardware is rather old, and the constant software issues are probably the most challenging aspects of actually performing the job from day to day.  I learned a lot about the banking industry, as well as lending.  My co-workers, for the most part, are some of the nicest people I've ever worked with.  The most enjoyable part of the job, I would have to say would be the most rewarding part of the job, which is the feeling I get when a frustrated client tells me at the end of the call that I've been the friendliest, most helpful person they've dealt with after calling back several times attempting to resolve the same issue.  Management for the most part are not the warmest people you'd ever want to meet, but my direct supervisor has been absolutely wonderful since day one, and I would work for her again somewhere else at the drop of a hat."
bad,"Excellent hours, Customer service is priority, Manager not great on engage with employees, not a culture or personal touch, Referrals was too high to meet goal every month. Coo workers very helpful."
bad,"SunTrust was great for building skills but pay was not enough, benefits were good. This location was closed and relocated overseas. Enjoyed the environment and the people."
bad,Digital Support Rep teaches you a lot about technical support and computer skills that you will know and keep for a life time. Teaches you the basic trouble shooting skills and proper terminology of the computer.
bad,Position was too specialize with limited scope.  Great co-workers and solid team spirit. Lots of law suits that could have been addressed by better management practices at the front end.
bad,This company works well with family. Unfortunately they don't do well in job security.
bad,Suntrust overrall was a great company to work for and had great benefits.
good,"good place for entry level employment. no future, no growth"
good,Poor Management and they bring new management very often and you have to start over each time.  The CEO is oblivious to the culture 2 levels below.  Tenure is frowned upon a most of the bank intelligence has been retired early.
good,"poor management from regional manager,"
good,I learned a lot working there I would definetly recommend. great place to work I love the money I made there. I worked with great coworkers.
good,The management with Consumer lending do not have a good working  relationship with their employees.  Most of management are not truthful with employees about future plans. Everyone is looking to leave and find a better career and better work environment.  Some of the manager have been with Suntrust 20 - 30 years and have that old time Mentality!
good,It became increasingly difficult to get loans approved and closed.  Last minute issues that should have been resolved early on were not addressed to the last minute.
good,"It was very unprofessional, Management was no help and the people that worked for the company very loud and unprofessional"
good,"Is not a stable nor a vision and values company. Cares only for sales and productivity. Customers need to come first. Then the rest will come with loyalty and building relationships,"
good,"During my tenure, there were no visbility nor stance on leadership; the company did not have proper detection tools nor systems to combat fraudulent activity. Fraud Enterprise line of business is a joke and for my understanding they are still experiencing a re-organization in various business areas. Looking for advancement or a friendly co-worker environment...run and never look back. This place is horrific!"
good,"I have never received any disciplinary action in my whole 18years with SunTrust, also received excellent annual reviews! Was told by my brand new manager of 1 month that Florida is a right to work state and fired me with no questions! Stated that my pre-approved appointments were approved by the previous manager who still works for the company and not by him even though his administration assistant had already place the approved dates on the calendar, I was told they would be considered an occurrences."
good,This was my first job into the financial arena. I started in college and remained an employee until I graduated. I enjoyed this position most of the time while there but felt the need to expand.
good,"they need to be more humans  understand the employees have needs too other wise this company would been a better experience,the other thing they need here is better equipment training and staff ."
good,"Management was horrible.  Did not support employees and could not be trusted."
good,"SunTrust has some great products and programs to help clients achieve financial well-being but there are some drawbacks when it comes to credit products and how employees are treated. For example, you have to have excellent credit in order to get approved for many of their products and I've found that many of my clients in this area just don't have it. In addition, staffing has been quite inadequate in my and other surrounding branches which has called for many 50-60+ hour weeks for my former manager and I for about six months. No matter how hard I've worked for the company, how many extra tasks, reports, etc. I'd completed to help keep the branch running smoothly, or how well I performed, SunTrust just didn't seem to appreciate it. They cut our bonuses and incentives programs multiple times until we barely received any and only focused on pointing out errors instead of recognizing us for our hard work. Needless to say, it was extremely stressful."
good,"SunTrust looks like a good place to work and says they offer a good work/life balance, but I and many didn’t see that. Pressure is high to make goals and you’re constantly competing against your coworkers which is stressful and makes for a tense work environment."
good,Was not a great place for me but it is different for everyone I am sure.  I wouldn't just give a negative review but I did want to be honest about my experience there.
good,"A lot of turnover and they do not even care. They cut employees salary. Micromanaged. They do not provide adequate training. They stated ""put the customer first"" but they only care about profits."
good,"It's been a long time since I worked for Suntrust but it was so cut throat I would never,work for them again. The Manager would call you out in front of the customers."
good,"SunTrust is working as hard as most other bigger banks to make it where humans are no longer needed. They are cutting the number of people in branches and bring in automated ATMs and things to replace people. Also management is severely lacking, they hire people from other banks and then with months most have quit because they are either ill prepared or can't hit the unobtainable goals."
good,"my co-workers making working here nice. A typical day of work would include very repetitive work such as credit card balances, payments, credit limit increases and balance transfers. Some of the management can be micro managers and others are very laid back. The hardest part of the job is not being able to say something to a very rude client that using degrading language towards you."
good,"Paper works everyday."
good,"Consists of helping Loan Officers, Processors, and Closers close loans for residential properties. Some of these are second homes, some are primary resident refinanced. "
good,"It's ok if you like micro-management. Unable to feel comfortable and high stressful environment."
good,"I was fairly new at the company, The manager was unprofessional, and she talked about her employees behind their backs. Instead of pulling me to the side to correct an error she did in very loudly in front of clients. She flirted with all of the male clients, pick and chose whose ID cards she verified prior to cashing their checks. The environment was very uncomfortable and dreaded going to work there. I called Hr for support several times and nothing was done."
good,"alot of employee harrassment, micro management is severe. Depending on depart you work in bosses rarely have you back even when following their orders."
good,"Leasing, Marketing Collecting rents, resident issues"
good,SunTrust tends to under-staff.  The downtown location is very busy. Co-workers are nice and helpful.
good,"Work culture is very sales oriented. Employees are under a great deal of pressure to sell, sell, sell. Customer service takes backseat to sales. Very hard for some employees to advance despite tenure and education."
good,"If you have a manager that believes in teamwork and is involved in your growth it can be a great company. Unfortunately I am currently under a Manger that is completely uninvolved and leaves 4 + hrs early everyday. This manager comes down on everyone for not meeting their individual goals, yet rarely meets her goals."
good,"While other departments may have a different experience than me, I had such a hard time with management being consistent and communication with one another enough."
good,Power and Sociopathic leadership bullies.Litigation division is highly disparate in its leadership and use FEAR motivation and threats constantly to manage control.
good,"SunTrust would have been a great place to work if the branches were actually given the resources to truly be successful. As a Manager with their In-Store division, we were open extended hours. (10am to 7pm daily.) However, we were required to be there daily at 8:30 for various conference calls and morning meetings but were also required to close due to both minimum management scheduling requirements and only having 3 associates at the majority of our In Store locations. This provided for absolutely NO work/life balance and a daily struggle to successfully make a working schedule as well as keep a worn out team of associates motivated and from becoming ""burned out"". Turnover at all branch levels was very high because of this."
good,very stressful no matter what we do is never good enough. they need to stop harassing the workers about sale. The problem here is that they get commotion on the amount of sales we do and they do not tell us that on moment of interview.
good,Very Productive when the volume of work was there.  Easy going office environment.  The Hardest part of the document preparation position was to ensure all documents went out right to the customer the first time around.  Attention to detail is a very big key in this department.
good,"Lot of turnover and reorganizing the structure all the time.  Poor merit increases but they are pretty fair on work life balance.  But, that does limit how much you can grow if you try to be there for your family."
good,It was just a start out job and it was pretty fun driving from bank to the bank after hours cleaning. It didn't last that long because the money wasn't that great.
good,I’m an IT person in Mortgage didn’t mesh right. Just wasn’t meant for me. I was promised I could get into the OT department however now that my year is approaching all of that was just a pipe dream.
good,I was an FSR at one of the Sun Trust bank instore locations. I have my business degree and chose Sun Trust because there corp. office is in Atlanta. The hardest part of this job is worklife balance during the week and weekends. I can't go to grad school because of the hours. The staffing has been cut and turnover is high. The management is inflexible with timeoff request. In addition there has been a steady increase of sales goals. The lack of growth and mobility is disappointing because management make it hard to get out of the branch environment and move to other departments.
good,I loved the benefits and pay. It allowed me freedom to move to Atlanta in my 20's.  I worked at an instore branch.  The only bad side to that was that they wanted sales from the same people everyday.
good,"The work environment needs to be improved as it pertains"
good,"This company requires a lots of effort to meet goals. Management is okay. The hardest part about the job is selling. I learned to manage time and work smart and not hard,"
good,I do not recommend this place. Your boss will always be on your case and there is little room for growth. Everyone is in their 40s and 50s.
good,"I found SunTrust to be a very political company with opportunity for those who excel at networking and office politics.  Also, very southern, conservative mindset at least in my immediate management."
good,"Extremely strong in sales Gold Award winner 2013,"
good,"Customer Service, open accounts, take loan apps, "
good,management was often funny acting and the females there were catty and unprofessional. Not much room for full time although I was promised full time in the beginning. No so much pay even with previous experience.
good,There was a lot of management turnover that resulted in loosing a lot of talented individuals and the elimination of the operational risk management group.
good,"I worked in their Charlotte NC Mortgage office.  We were a mall office only about 30 people. Management was poor.  The laid off 2 team leads, a young man and an older women only to bring back a minority lady who was on maternity leave,  We were given notice on a cold wintry morning and the office was closed.  Received a phone call stating there was a mandatory conference in 30 minutes.  Was told the office was closing.  COLD hearted management could not face us in person."
good,Could be a great place to work. Depending on the dept expect to be heavily micro managed. Beware your immediate supervisor as they will look out for themselves first. If you are looking to advance be sure you have powerful friends as its not what but who that will get you advanced.
good,"Suntrust is fast paced and goal orientated, if you are not hitting goal or unable to sell products this is not this place for you"
good,High Stress Environment with aggressive Sales Goals.  Lack of consistency in procedures and expectations.  A lot of changes in Senior Management in the DC Metro area on a regular basis.
good,"Extreme lack of staffing, old out-dated equipment, lack of management, stressful, very pushy and stressful for sales, no work, life, balance. The training could be better."
good,"Typical day at work, was assisting clients as well as maintaining the professional look of the branch, and handling the assets. I learned how to be thrown into the fire, and how to operate under pressure. The training is not where it needs to be. The hardest part of the job honestly was dealing with management that never felt like you were an asset. The most enjoyable part would be dealing with the clients."
good,Poor management but nice coworkers. Hard to sales accounts and the system is not to friendly. Old machines to process money order which makes your work harder.
good,"Just another financial institution.  Same old same old.  I liked the hours of course, but upward mobility and raises are few and far between even if you are top 10% in the company."
good,I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge and ability to numerous  projects for SunTrust Bank. Decent work environment. The department you work in will dictate your level and pace of advancement.
good,"Good people there, hard working but staff is kept low and people are overworked they reorganize a lot and hire from outside too much. culture is changing from a caring fair environment to uncaring in employee moral"
good,"SunTrust was not the worst place I've ever worked at. However, it is far from the best. They unfortunately are very good at putting the wrong people in the wrong positions and underpaying employees if you start with a low beginning salary, regardless of how well you outperform your higher paid peers. No sense of care from upper management in 3 different areas that I've worked in."
good,Not the best place to grow. A place to maintain a steady check. the company losing job sites all around the south. my department was dismantled within the month.
good,The SunTrust Bank I left in April 2017 is not the same as the one I was hired into September 1995.  The management is more concerned about efficiency ratio than teammates.  Work days average 10 hours a day and there is no concept for vacation.  There is no loyalty for tendered employees.
good,Loved job felt great about it but management would protect themselves before employees and would throw employees under the bus to make themselves look better. forced to stay after hours and make cold calls if sales numbers were not met
good,"The benefits are great. There is a wide variety of options to chose from to meet your needs whatever your family status may be. the company offers perks &  discounts as well as financial coaching and other wellness incentives.  The work culture:  a lot of emphasis on inclusion such as culture, lifestyle and race but that is where it ends. Management: It is just like anywhere else. It really depends on who you work for or with as it relates to recognizing the talent of their employees without feeling threatened by it. I've had many wonderful supportive managers and several that were not. High focus on QC, risk and audits, yet no one is held accountable and would rather create new groups to repair rather than holding employees to the trained and documented processes.."
good,"The hardest part of the job was the unfair Management."
good,Unrealistic goals at large branch because of error by regional manager. Required to work 6 days a week with no overtime. Forced to try to sell everything to everyone no matter what their need.
good,"SunTrust is an overall great company to work for; however, I do not approve of my current manager. On most days, I do enjoy coming to work. At the moment, I am looking for other opportunities within the organization"
good,The days are long. The pay could be better. I've done a ton of work that is not in my job description. Meaning there are times I work for free. Management sucks. The goals are not realistic.
good,"Worked in a production department, creating documents that needed to be attached to mortgages that defined the chain of title. This also included a lot of research per counties and states in the USA."
good,Training for employees to enter the workforce at Suntrust is like going through a mental boot camp and college all over again. Managers do not care what their employees think.
good,"Every 6 months, we try something new.  We MUST get back to basics banking for our clients.  More conversations and less product pushing"
good,"This is better than your typical retail job because you get the professional work hours of 9-5. But, if you HATE sales like I do, then this isn't the job for you. SunTrust has high sales goal that in some branches are unobtainable. If your branch and/or area/region is down in sales goals/numbers, you are required to stay long hours to make sure you can make those goals the next business day."
good,"Good bank to start your career as teller. "
good,"There are a lot of good people who work for SunTrust, but the environment is that of typical office politics. Advancement is based on who you know, not on your performance. Work schedule was not flexible, and all employees were not treated equally."
good,"A typical day of work consists of waiting on clients and meeting sales and service goals.  SunTrust provides you with opportunity to learn how to make better business decisions.  Co-workers are like any job, you win some, you lose some."
good,"The management is corporate, and that inflexible corporate mentality governs a lot of day-to-day processes, as well as your own larger career, and overall morale.  If you're happy being a cog in a machine, go corporate."
good,"Set breaks and lunches, tethered to a phone the remainder of the day.Performance measured solely on quantity of calls and sales, not quality of service provided.Emphasis is on sales of new services and products."
good,"At Perdue when I was at work it was very long work days. I was never guaranteed to get 40 hours a week. Management there really only wanted to promote their favorite workers and not the ones who could do the job properly. The shift I worked on got shut down and my co workers were able to choose a different department to go work in, but I was forced to go to a different shift with no choice. My shift opened back up and I was then again forced to switch shifts for a second time. I rarely enjoyed my time working there. Throughout the day I would be constantly breathing in flour which made it very hard to breathe. I also would put more effort into my work than others and never got any recognition for the job I would do."
good,"My days were steady.  I didn't like the fact that I was a contractor, threrfore, I couldn't enjoy the benefits."
good,I learned how to more effectively manage the micro with my employees
good,"Suntrust is a good company to work for. But if you work in the call center any hours and days you may have to work. As all offices there are good people and not so good. "
good,Not the best financial services company. A lot micro-management
good,A part time position that did not offer room for growth or opportunity 
good,"Doesn't feel like they stay with a plan long enough to truly evaluate if the plan is working or not."
good,"Learned alot about banking and finance, management however is very challenging and sales pressure is intense."
good,Basic teller transactions
good,They need to take better care if the teller line. Greet all customer when entering the building. Manager has no idea what goes in the teller line and how it works.
good,"Reviewing of the real estate loan documents for new and refinanced mortgages (FHA and Conventional) to determine and ensure adequacy and accuracy in compliance with bank policy and procedures and provided timely review of home loans for loan modifications, etc."
good,"The job is very fast paced and varies from day to day.You can take 100 checking transactions and then open an account, help someone apply for an auto loan, and refer someone else to mortgage. I learned that with little direction I can thrive under pressure and still get results. I have grown as an individual through this experience. The management is not on the same page at all and is more goal and sales oriented than people oriented. Management changed several times in the short time I was there and none of them produced the results necessary to stay in their position or meet the goals set forth by upper management. Several coworkers from other branches have settled in to a routine and have found their niche. It is hard to work in my particular branch because we are understaffed and not all team members are working on the same level or with the same intensity. The hardest part of my job is trying to motivate the rest of the team and still meet my goal while being told that our “team” is the worst team in the area.It is also difficult to handle that what is good for one person is not good for another. I enjoy working with my clients and finding ways to make my job easier for myself and sharing that with my coworkers."
good,"The banking industry is shakey right now, but SunTrust is proactivly taking steps to secure it's satisfaction rating. Continuous training, communication & testing."
good,"Okay company other than the pay. Industry pays 60k for the job and responsibilities of analyst, Truist/SunTrust pays mid 40k. A diverse company and inclusive. Good opportunities to volunteer."
good,"There is much need for upgrade technology. The business vocabulary and treatment of employees by some managers need improvement. There is a lack of business respect.  Some managers have a demeaning undertone. I have witnessed this same management style from 3 different managers who differ in race and size. The common denominator, women."
good,So stressful being a teller. Was forced to have sales referrals even though I was in a remote drive in for most of the week. Tried firing me before I went on maternity leave so they didn't have to deal with me.
good,"Daily Activities coordinate to the Sales Head regarding the daily sales, new agents, concern of the agents and managers , new memorandum, commission to be released , manning problem, clients concern."
good,"I loved working for SunTrust the first few years, but when they began grooming for a merger the culture changed to a more goal-oriented, stressful sales environment.  We used to care about our clients' financial well-being, but then we manipulated that sentiment into a marketing plan that allowed the drive for numbers to indicate our success.  This went against my values."
good,"SunTrust is a great place to work when given opportunity. Sad to see it change with merger and how it will impact so many lives. The typical day is covered with meetings with staff, management, and clients. The hardest part of the job is balancing the expected with the unexpected on a daily basis which can make work life balance very difficult. Schedules are constantly changing and lack of staff."
good,Call center had long hard difficult hours.  There was way to much micro managing even if you were a top performer.  This was a good way to push away good employees.
good,"First full time position in mortgage."
good,"Job was ok, manager did not know  any ops and ego was very high. Learned what I needed from other employees in other branches. Teller coordinators are responsible and blamed for more than the branck managers."
good,"Day starts with a morning huddle, game plan for the day is discussed. Goals, objectives for the day are discussed."
good,"The manager that I had did not communicate clearly yet accused me of not communicating clearly.  She had hired 48 contractors and only hired on one at that point.  Not easy to please.  So it was a just fine experience, but my experience with her made this a bad one."
good,My time at Suntrust was just ok. Everyday it was like working on eggshells. If you did not sell enough products to customers it was like you would loose your job.
good,"turning into Wells Fargo, and bank of America. I still like my work environment and work with great people and I love what i do, but you can see the changes with people coming from wells and BOA. Sun trust now is a numbers game and number driven and not people driven anymore in my opinion"
good,"I worked there for amount 2.5 years. I left there with the same amount of knowledge I came in with. Management changed 3 times during my employment, and I wasn't groomed or coached for any future roles within the company. Job advancement was very hard due to the requirement standard. Obtaining any sort of bonus was extremely hard due the heightened sales goals that were placed; which also played a huge part in job advancement."
good,Management was untrained and not able to manage banking branch properly. Turnover in banking employees was a big issue for this bank and staff was untrained.
good,Great benefits but very low compensation. Management needs to pay attention to compensating high performers and offer more opportunities for advancement
good,"SunTrust upper management change daily operations on a whim, there is a lack of communication between upper management and operational level management.  the company is more reactive than proactive. The company is decades behind all competitor's with technology."
good,They care more about saving money than keeping jobs in America. Company believes outsourcing is the best way to reduce cost regardless of  quality....
good,I would rather not complete this review thank you for understanding . I thank you again for your offer to complete the review for this employer however I would rather not
good,"The culture has changed.  New Management is more about how many sales per day, not how many client we helped!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"A culture unlike I've even experienced in the workplace.  Leaders are known to change direction at the last minute or claim to not have enough knowledge about a topic, which would effectively derail the timeline."
good,Unfortunately I have not had the best of experiences at SunTrust. In the 2 years I have been here I have went through 3 branch managers and 3 area managers. My managers and area managers have also not been truthful when it comes to helping me advance. I was the 2nd best FSR in my area and was passed up for promotion multiple times due to the constant change in command. The products and vision for SunTrust are great. With proper support and guidance you can do very well at SunTrust.
good,"The benefits offered by the company are great.  The non management employees are great."
good,ok job. not hard work. great customers.  stressful management. hound you like a dog. all about money not helping customers. job doesnt allow for great work life balance.
good,You are monitored to much if you go to the restroom it may affect your numbers. You have to be very punctual because every minute is monitored. On the bright side if you learn a lot of how the bank operates.
good,"Management are flexible, it has good benefits, but job culture could be improved by strong quality leaders. Goals set difficult to achieve since loans are not equally distributed."
good,"Suntrust is a good company to begin your banking career with.  A good place to ""get your feet wet"" learning the financial industry.  I would recommend Suntrust to begin your career as a teller."
good,"The hardest part of the day is letting people leave with unresolved solutions due to bad credit. My typical day is not saying NO to customers. Processing accounts, loans and retirement plans."
good,"Respect many teammates, lots of reorganization and not great on compensation unless you are a high level employee, there are silos so end to end processes are in need of improvement, otherwise good on execution in AML-Financial Intelligence Unit. Good at offering  learning portal courses"
good,"It was a enjoyable job at first but then became really stressful and impossible to meet goals. The role play was ridiculous with upper management, nothing was the right thing to say."
good,Terrible management. The benefits are not the best at all and its expensive. Terrible training practices. I did learn quite a bit about the mortgage process. So at least I got that out of the job
good,"Suntrust is a good company but various departments lacks the ability to successfully communicate, work cohesively as a group, motivate,train and provide directions for it's employees.  The company lacks the resources to investment in effective training and technical support. There is a tremendous amount of outsourcing as well as restructuring which appear to occur twice annually in the same areas."
good,"Sun Trust Bank was also a great pleace to work.  It was in downtown Atlanta, GA  and it eventually was not worth that long trip from my home and without any kind of stipen for gas or otherwise I needed to move on.  "
good,worked at North with clients that had behavior issues provided coaching for jobs and self care assisted clients with achieving daily goals my co- workers were all on the same page the overtime was always available and taking the clients out into the community without incident was the most enjoyable
good,most enjoyable is the clientele - worst part is the constant changing of personnel and management strategies. Outdated equipment and software made it hard to function in real world.
good,Suntrust offers a flexible schedule where I'm able to live early and can make up the time if need be. I would like to see a monthly bonus plan in place to ensure you are paid for performance.
good,"Brand new and still learning the job overall is okay. variety of different businesses calling in with there concerns. Payments, card activations, adding card holders, lost or stolen cards, etc."
good,Great culture with room for growth. Employees are very friendly throughout the footprint and helpful. Goals can be unreasonable at times but the compensation is worth it.
good,A typical day at work is minute to minute busy.  I work in a fast paced environment with plenty to do at all times.  I learned a lot about credit and various types of business analysis.  My team is well managed.  My co-workers are certainly the most rewarding and enjoyable part of my job.  I work with some really great people in my immediate team.  The hardest part of my job is the amount of administrative work that needs to be done day to day.  It is very distracting and makes it difficult to complete value-added tasks within an 8 hour day.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my team and flexibility in work-life balance.
good,Great job for starting out decent pay and time off is a bonus because banks are closed for holidays.Coworkers are enjoyable and management seems self centered. Company as a whole lost sight of the client perspective making it harder to provide great customer service.
good,There are not enough employees for the work place. I was very miserable while working there.
good,"Easy work... Management is horrible...Time/ Attendance policy is unreasonable... HR policies gives management free range to do what they please. Everything is up to the discretion of management."
good,"It was a fun experience and learned a lot, co-workers were good and fun to work with."
good,A typical work day is spent working on various task as needed.
good,"If you love sales pressure this is the job for you."
good,Very political environment. Management disconnected from realistic expectations from current market place.
good,"This company has great people working for them, yet a disconnect in achieving the goals.  It is hard to work where leadership is not seen on a daily basis and where individual performance is not tied to anything."
good,"Typical day at work is very busy, manager is not a leader for future advancement to employees, coworkers are a team, the hardest part about my job is knowing that thier is no room for advancement...the most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and exceeding all expectations."
good,Working for Sun Trust in the beginning was wonderful!!!! A year later Sun hired an AWFUL manager and poof everything changed. New manager was verbily abusive!!
good,Company is behind the times in new age banking and trying to catch up but questionable hires and a revolving door of employees keeps the company from advancing.
good,I was a full-time employee at Suntrust I work there for 10 years. I was the vault teller and a hard team go getter. I value my client that I work for and the team that I work for.
good,"Compensation is good, loved the hours and enjoyed some of the clients and co-workers"
good,My day consisted of driving from various location to make sure consist messages were delivered to the clients. Identify that all operational controls were being followed and if not my job was to coach the teammates on operational issues. Teammates were wonderful.
good,A typical day to day work day. Enjoyed working with a great team of co-workers.
good,Some uppermanagement sweeps activity of certain employees under the rug.
good,Learned alot about banking that helped me in my personal life
good,Completed costumers transactions in a time efficient manner.
good,"I executed more than 10 transactions and helped bring in more than $15 million in fees. I enjoyed what I was doing; however, I had to move back to New York City to help care for aging parents."
good,"Practical daily duties, lack diversity, location was feasible to home."
good,I worked in 2 departments for the company. One department was very laid back. I worked in another department that had unbelievably poor management. My advice would be to stay out of the operations center. I haven't experienced or heard anything bad about any other location.
good,It is a good company with excellent culture. A lot of great projects people can learn with different departments and different people. Overall a fair good company to work with.
good,The worst systems and that getting paid on the 1st and 15th is AWFUL why and then paying for parking there is horrible no thank and it hard to work from home as well it takes forever
good,This was a good position to learn about Agile methodologies. The team was Agile but the systems need to keep installations moving were outdated and needed to be updated.
good,"A typical day is fast paced. Some clients are truly grateful, recognize and appreciate relief from financial stress. Some branch managers definitely need sensitivity training and more. The pay is definitely not there! There is lots of gratification to be had from helping clients."
good,"President of the bank just pretty much ruled the place, breaking rules and policies for family, friends, etc. Example; I would get in trouble for not letting her dad put anyone's checks into his account. Even if his name was nowhere on the check."
good,It seemed that when you worked for a promotion that they would change the job titles and what those jobs entailed.  They also had a referral program that was unrealistic.  I enjoy he people I worked with though.  The branch managers were not the problem
good,"Company has the right goals, but management at the middle levels does not realistically apply the vision provided from corporate leadership.  I personally worked in the infrastructure group which was run by a walking HR nightmare."
good,"I worked at SunTrust for a number of years, as a temporary employee. When I left, I was still a temp employee. I organized and prepped mortgage loan documents. A typical day was finishing about 6-10 containers filled with files to be scan, and process into the system. I was the leading processer there, until I was assigned to start training new employees. Management was great. Most of the workers were temp employees, so there was a lot of drama/conflict amongst the staff. It was a typical 3-11pm, Mon-Fri workweek. The hardest part of the job was that there was no job growth within the company."
good,In retail career advancement is very slow. The entire industry is struggling in Virginia which also makes it hard to achieve sales goals. There is much diversity as well. Overall its a great company however just a difficult time to be in the banking indusrty.
good,"I was in an administrative assistant position and while the pay was adequate, I know that a co-worker who was male and inexperienced was paid just as much as I was with my advanced experience. I was not given ample opportunities for growth and when I inquired about it, I was basically patted on the head and said we will see. I was allowed to work from home when available, but added work was given regularly with no pay increase."
good,"Provided assistance to Private Wealth, Retail, Business & Corporate clients on a daily basis."
good,Suntrust doesn’t value their employees and theirs no work life balance at all... things change everyday there not to enhance the company but to make it harder for employees to succeed at their jobs
good,This is a great opportunity to those people into selling banking products and services to consumers. You need to be detailed and organized because working in the banking industry is methodical.
good,"SunTrust began as a great place to work, but over time it became evident that they only wanted to push out their older generation of loan officers and bring in green, college graduates so they could pay them less and centralize everything.  Too many hands in the pie making rules and too little supervision."
good,"I like the job over all, I enjoy my teammates, but I have had 4 different area mangers  since I have been employed here all promising different things and not following through. ST wants to deliver clients into ""financial confidence"" but their products/services does not always align with those principles. I was surpassed twice for a promotion I earned and was promised. Also, their human resources department is not geared to protect lower level employees, only the higher ups. My manager micro managed too much, but not all managers operate with that style."
good,"Hired under the guise of helping people, but it was just another sales job. The use colorful slogans to glaze over trying to sell services. Sale or leave. Management failed to comprehend this logic: in the past, the business thrived because branch locations were in new neighborhoods, meaning new opportunities and online banking wasn't as diverse and convenient. Both of these factors have changed drastically so physical locations are no longer needed as much or as often, but the sales goals that are set are not factoring for digressions such as these. Leading management to stress the employees to hate their work. Pressuring them, under the impression of caring, to dig into peoples personal lives to give them a 'solution' (bank profiting service) so their goals are reached, and management will not be as hard on them for one more month, until the cycle repeats itself."
good,"Suntrust is stressful."
good,"A typical work day was standard. The work environment was good. The commute was good, great work location. The work was easy to learn. Training was minimal."
good,"Banks in general can be high stress, face paced environments. This bank has a diverse culture and is involved in improving culture diversity, that is a plus."
good,A clean safe environment that set sales goals the average person could not reach.  Most of my piers did not reach the sales goals set for them by the company.
good,bad art/ oppressive environment. overall I feel I had a bad experience because of the management they had in place. other people had a better experience. not many though.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is rewarding to learn new and interesting things daily. Understanding the various functions that can and may change on a day to day basis.
good,A typical day is getting your work daily and completion them timely. We deal with time sensitive document so we have tight deadlines which results in some form of micro managing.
good,management have no idea how complicated is dealing with 19 systems that are not integrated. Demand for Production is way to high up to the point that you may compromise your health.
good,enjoyed my time working there but did not feel secure as an employee because the company outsourced a great amount of teams. The pay we pretty low but not terrible.
good,"A good organization, but so many managers prefer not to lead or make important decisions.  Team members understand the culture and tend to find ways to get along with head down."
good,"The leaders in a company are a good reflection of their culture and value.  Most of  SunTrust leaders and decision makers ( in my opinion) do not represent their diverse workforce or the communities in which they serve.  It is very difficult, almost impossible, to pierce the strong network for middle and upper management opportunities.  The pay and benefits are good, unfortunately there was a lack of sensitivity to fairness, support and not maximizing  the skills and capabilities of certain pockets of employees."
good,Salary not commensurate with cost of living. Corporate culture was positive. Call center environment was average. The most difficult part of the job was being on the phone with irrate customers.
good,The pay is okay. The career advancement is pretty low unless you play the office politics. There are layoffs when the work gets slow. There is nothing special here.
good,"Ok place to work, but then the downsizing happened. Managers were consistently being cycled out every 6 months due to lack of meeting min sales goals."
good,Short staffed and executives not making good business decisions.  A lot of branches closing and goals are so high that it's almost impossible to earn incentives.
good,The hardest part is competing other originators for mortgage loans.  No a team oriented place.  A typical day is making contacts with potential clients for mortgage loans
good,In my department the expectations are unrealistic and unobtainable.  Management speaks to the employees like they are children.  The job is very stressful and the requirements change almost daily.
good,Management should have better working hours and should be more flexible with time off. ive been working there for 6 months my department has favoritism between employees.
good,"Poor management and very easy job. If you're not lazy, you'll be great. Time management and precaution is needed in this job. You must make sure you double check what you do."
good,"Enjoyed the colleagues as they were friendly and supportive. Management need to review department task and responsibilities, as work from other departments are not handled appropriately."
good,"busy helping officers and customers."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is establishing relationships with new and existing clientele."
good,"A typical day at work starts with a fresh cup of unattainable goals. I have learned that though the company's language reflects teammates, it has a second, and contradicting definition which compels dog-eat-dog attitudes among co-workers. Management seems to be hand picked by higher-ups in a field of monotonous under-achievers. Workplace culture, if implemented correctly has the potential to provide a heaping serving of uplifting motivation and a side of high-hopes. This isn't the case as while the company provides great incentives, reaching goals is impossible and the opportunities you're given to take time off or benefit from is frowned upon. The hardest part of the job has to be not breaking down into tears or revolting against the establishment which sets you up to fail. The most enjoyable parts of the job are the clients, the hours, if you get the opportunity then your co-workers."
good,"On a typical day at Suntrust Mortgage I come in and log into my phone to make sure I am ready to take calls at the start of my shift. Throughout the day I may be placed in a system called Avaya. On this system I make outbound calls. This is what I do on a regular day. I have learned how to use a system called Clarifire,Lending Portal and Msp."
good,"Understaffed and highly stressed environment.  Management will not support their staff and tell you what a good job you are doing but when push comes to shove, they will not back up or support their employees."
good,I loved being a teller. It taught me a lot of skill i would need in new jobs. However the company i didn't like how the training and actual on site experience were too different. I felt the policies and gui lines were too up in the air and nothing was done until a negative situation occurred. I really felt teller were definitely out on the front line for the negative backlash of the company.
good,"SunTrust as a company, is a very diverse place to work.  This company is a great place for many people of different ethnicity to find employment and possibly a career.  Management within my department has become much better since the outside sourcing of a company that review surveys about our current management.  Before this, management was basically not be held accountable for their action.  They were able to govern my department outside the lines of company regulation and policies.  But with the induction of these surveys which are taken yearly, much has changed and now we are encompassed within the companies original vision of how a organization should run."
good,I liked working at SunTrust and enjoyed the people.  Everyone is nice and helpful.  They care about their community and encourage their employees to volunteer.
good,I thank my current employer for all of the knowledge I have gained and for affording me the opportunity understand the production side of the workforce
good,Great co-workers and excellent moral environment but senior management and job duties/responsibilities are constantly changing without hands on training or much communication and also having outdated computer systems not in keeping with the industry.  Unwillingly to compensate at market place standards.   Great colleagues and supportive environment.
good,With Suntrust I have gained a wealth of knowledge. I was fortunate to work with the wonderful individuals that made up my team.
good,"Working here as provided some awesome perks such as going to Hollywood, FL for a Platinum Award Conference, but retail banking has proven to be extremely micromanaging and mortgage banking makes many promises to get you over to them but then  renigs on everything once you join the mortgage team"
good,My experience is that the firm concentrates too much of the decision making and the ability to act at the top of the house.  I feel it tends to stifle the firms ability to advance and thrive. Leadership does not foster an environment where it is ok to challenge the status quo and to stretch our thinking beyond what their opinions may be. Communications and decision making is less than open and collaborative.
good,Great work life balance.  Overall Management is behind the times.  Lacking in process and discipline.  Still catching up to the rest.
good,Merging into the sales and product pushing ways. They are turning into Wells Fargo. Very long hours. Management needs to improve.
good,I am seriously trying to leave this company. Job security is defintely not secure these days. There are so many cut backs going on.
good,"Good Company, I learn a lot, micromanagement can be challenging some times, coworker too, but it is all about chose to be positive, the hardest part of the job get incentives and the most enjoyable part of the job the interaction with clients"
good,"Cashed checks, helped customers with banking transactions. Offered and suggested to a specific product for each individual customer. "
good,"Didn't care much about advancing their employees.  Never had a performance review in 5 years, so there wasn't a clear understanding of the expectations."
good,Subject speaks for itself. Sell or you're gone. As simple as that. If you dont like being pressured into sales than dont apply.
good,"Overall Salary, Incentives, Benefits are fairly good. Difficult to advance internally if you're in the branch.  Goals vary widely depending on location."
good,"The environment is fast-paced and demanding.  Unfortunately, the technology and management style does not meet the industry and company's expectation."
good,Compensation and benefits are wonderful. I have never worked for a company that had a better pay for performance system and I thrived with it. Where the center I worked in was lacking was a personal approach to its employees. People were often on edge just wondering if they would be let go. Valuing employees is something that was missing.
good,"I was disappointed with this companies environment. Lots of drama and not enough advancements for career growth. The mortgage is amazing, but the employees within themselves do not get a long well."
good,"Typical work culture. No fun activities."
good,"Happiness at suntrust depends greatly on the manager you work under. Some are nurturing, others are horrible. If you just want to ""settle in"" somewhere, it's a decent place. Many of my coworkers had been there 5,10, and 20 plus years. They are fairly stable and secure.. they don't do the seasonal layoffs like the other big banks do. Two things to keep in mind before you accept a job offer... don't ever expect a raise over 2.5%, (seriously.. my ""promotion"" was a 1% pay bump) and don't expect to try out different positions to find one that fits..12 months minimum in each post. They hire from temp agencies, so don't be scared to negotiate salary once you get a permanent offer. Another word of advice.. read the handbook and policies. You won't get things like shift differential unless you know to ask for them."
good,"A typical day at work was fairly busy due to the lack of staff, everyone had more than one job title although they were just getting paid for one.  Everyone helped where they could to get things done.  For example, the Assistant Branch Manager will help on the teller line so that the teller can balance, replenish, and settle the ATM machines. Through my time here, I have learned how to work effectively and efficiently while I met goals and managed my role as an ATM Custodian and Customer Service Representative.  The hardest part of my job is not having the proper tools to work with and/or knowledge of certain questions customer's asked and couldn't answer.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers that came and gone as I was there."
good,Suntrust as a whole is a very nice company to work for.  There are numerous tools and resources to help you be productive.
good,I enjoyed my job. There are a lot of layoff and your the computer systems they use are not the best.
good,"On a regular day with SunTrust, I process all debit, credit, and cash transactions, assist clients wtih difficult transactions and account questions, maintain the security of teller line, securely open and close the branch, and assist clients by referring them to specific products and services based on the clients needs."
good,"SunTrust is a great company to work for, however Senior Management needs to address line level management and how they handle situations as it does not follow SunTrust's core values."
good,Manager was over powering and micro managed. Didn't seem to have any empathy at all for the teammates
good,All I can say is you better hope you have a strong backbone and can deal with being treated like a dog.
good,"I have nothing good to say about Suntrust. Very poor management that stays outside the company more than she stays inside and trys to help people versus,doing services behind their back, opening accts & sending applications thru for CC when they clearly tell her no, they are not interested. I have seen and met with several families while working with this company. Manager there currently is very unprofessional!!!!"
good,"I have enjoyed the immediate work environment, however, I find managment continues to present larger expectations with no adjustment for market area.  In short they do not seem to understand the differences in small rural markets vs. city markets."
good,"Wear a suit and tie every day.  These are ""bankers"" in the absolute sense of the word.  "
good,"good company alot of change over and downsizing but, a good company"
good,I have been a head teller in charge of other tellers; also in charge of ordering and receiving large quantities of money. Opened and closed accounts and handled the different types of day to day banking for clients.
good,"Hostile environment, inconsistent management, uptight co workers, OK pay."
good,"Manage a large department of analyst and specialist. Review daily reports. Looking for efficiencies and best practices, coaching and training on a regular basis."
good,Management at my branch was not there. Started career with Sunstrust and left to look for other opportunities
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist people by providing quality customer service
good,"Overall, Good company to work for. Afforded a lot of advancement opportunities throughout my time with the company."
good,The customers are wonderful and it is easy to talk to them. Employees should be encouraged and valued.
good,Not happy with the new changes in the corporate structure. Also the upper Management is less to be desired...
good,"Company with great stability, just not alot of advancement."
good,"The Bank was in the process of remodeling its business model in the areas of mortgage and real estate, the environment was very unstable."
good,I didn't enjoy working at SunTrust they have very poor management. I was under a lot of stress due to production. I was fired because they wanted to hire a friend of the management team. They did hire the friend of the management a few months after I was fired.
good,Make sure your making your goals before a promotion or the company will totally low ball you in your offer and when they bump up the minimum wage you will be paid what an incoming employee with no experience makes.
good,"1. Hourly pay needs improvement ."
good,My experience was mixed.  My immediate manager was amazing.  My district manager was hottible.  She was unethical and pitted the employees against one another.  The hours were awful because the turnover was so high.  I found myself opening and closing the branch on the same day quite a bit.  I experienced unfair treatment by upper management and was lied on.
good,"great place to work, good benefits, ok pay, but no room for advancement.sometimes the environment can be childish due to large mass of hiring teens/young adults. orlando(customer service) supervisors have no knowledge and area allows their reps to tell clients anything"
good,"SunTrust was excellent regional bank with footprints from VA to FLORIDA, then things and business practices began to change as soon as upper management decided they wanted to change from small town charm and character and morph into Wachovia now known as Wells Fargo. Started hiring all Wells Fargo employees at an alarming rate,and the word of the day became sales sales sales,no matter what and any customer became a dollar sign and not a person."
good,"The ""bonus"" is almost unattainable for bankers, and is unfairly based off of the ""team"" performance, as opposed to the individual's performance. "
good,SunTrust can be a very good place to work. They actively support a positive and inclusive diverse culture. The management team is made up of highly competitive personalities that prioritize self promotion over quality work.
good,Nothing really great about this company. They don't really pay you what you're worth. If you are looking to get your foot in the door then this is a great starting point!
good,"An average day was very micro managed"
good,"Suntrust is a great place to work for people without children."
good,"Risk Management, Audit & Compliance."
good,"In some areas, the culture is vey ‘cold’ or unfriendly because of the lack of personality of some Managers:  Hopefully, Suntrust will begin placing more emphasis on the personality of individuals before they are hired or promoted to Management and not just the experience."
good,I have been managing my office for the last few months and I have learned so much working with the staff that I  am proud to say we have developed a great team environment.
good,"Personal banker who exceeded individual and branch sales goals by offering products and services and developing and retaining relationships."
good,"SunTrust offers competitive salaries and benefits.  Sun Trust promotes continuing education."
good,"Sr. management is purely interested only in shareholder value.  "
good,SunTrust Bank is a sales driven bank.  They do promote thinking outside the box.  The encourage building rapport and building  client relationships.  They need to promote within more.
good,"It's fun most of the time working at Sun Trust Bank. I love working in a fast-paced environment especially in a busy branch that I am working now. It is also gratifying when I help client fulfill their financial goals which could be stressful sometimes."
good,I was a fraud investigator there for over 20 years.  I was successful in collecting overdrawn accounts and working with law enforcement and the state and federal agencies.  Upon the illness of my father I went out on leave to assist with my dying father and they eliminated my position shortly after my return.  I felt they should have given me more time to grieve for my aging father without eliminating my position.
good,"Given Atlanta's crazy traffic, this is a big plus as well as the ability to work remotely. Advancement opportunities on the other hand are not that great. People stay in their roles for years, some up to 30 years!"
good,"offer telecommute which is great because you do have to pay for parking which Sun Trust do not cover if you are in the downtown office.  The people are great the company no so much. Because the company is not as big as other banks, the technology being used is outdated although they are making strides to catch up. The hardest part of the job is changing management and ideas. Many things do not make sense and hurt productivity. The best part of the job is working from home."
good,"SunTrust is a fast pace company that encourages its teammates to give back to the community. Additionally, the organization offers several programs to help teammates improve their financial well being and health. However, the organization does not spending money on team building and expects teammates to work extremely hard with little reward. Also, advancing or finding a new position within the company is hard because most managers already have a person in mind for the position before it is posted. Moreover, they offer standard increases for new jobs despite the jobs responsibilities and individuals current salary. Overall, it is a decent place to work, but the organization should spend more money on teammate appreciation and team building activities."
good,"The culture at SunTrust varies from division.  If you're in corporate, there's a certain culture.  If you're in operations, there's another. "
good,"SunTrust offered great medical type of benefits and paid vacation.  Their 401k package was competitive except in order to be fully invested the requirement is to be employed 2 years and my position was eliminated due to a reduction of workforce a few months prior to my 2 year anniversary.  The team environment was the worst I have ever experienced in my 27 year professional history.  Most of the department had been in the same area for 20+ yeas and didn't work well in a  team environment and didn't want to share their knowledge or when asked a question, received part of an answer. To be fair,  I am not sure if it was only the area I worked in or if this is across the organization."
good,"Can't comment since I don't want to sound negative about a company. I found a lot favoritism in terms of upwards movement. You need to know someone at higher up to move up despite your knowledge, education, experience, and contribution towards the organization. I didn't enjoy working there."
good,n/a not comfortable about writing a review would like for people to try experience for self . Only can say a good place to work for and that they gave me a chance to be a team player with the company
good,"Manager was not a very good employee, and our branch was closed due to downsizing in our geographic area. "
good,"Constant turnover from senior managment all the way down to branch staffing on the retail, investment and commercial business banking sides of the organization. Which in turn always created uncertainty of which direction SunTrust wanted to go and what was the next ""hot topic/focus"" and not focusing on the clients and what matters to them."
good,"SunTrust as an overall company is a wonderful place to work. Unfortunately, there is little opportunities for advancement and job security is not a guarantee."
good,Loved working with the clients and fulfilling their needs. Management was passive aggressive and was not direct with expectations. Any mistakes made were not discussed with employee but instead told to other employees and that's how you find out you did something wrong.
good,SunTrust has changed over the years.  Management does not care about teammates.  The company constanty offshores departments and is not a stable environment.
good,I've learned how to manage money and count effenciently. Dealing with numbers were not my strongest skill. However working at SunTrust taught me to take my time and listen to my clients.
good,too many managers. lot of turmoil and disruptive management. Never know what to expect. Someone workers just unwilling to assist other co-workers. just very disappointed in the true team effort.
good,Team tried to re-invent the wheel everyday.  Reporting format was overly meticulous and unnecessary.  Questions were not welcome.  Communication standards were not clear.
good,"I typical day at work involved reviewing any loans based on state and federal guidelines The management in the workplace at times can be extremely professional, but at times there are lapses in communication among co-workers and team member and instructions are not communicated effectively. As far as the company culture goes my fellow co-workers are professional individuals who also put their best effort forward when conducting business. The most enjoyable part of my job would be when my teams approval rating increase by almost 65% within two months."
good,"High Stress job due to never satisfied management supporting abusive ""Wells Fargo-like"" sales tactics. "
good,"Overall I think they try to make things better about the Mortgage Loan position.  Good people in a very stressful environment. Closing department is overworked and poorly lead.  Central office needs a new leader who can perform to that standard.Most LOs would agree with that statement.  I think senior management needs to take charge and make it right, especially for the customers."
good,Management was lacking in leadership skills. People was giving leadership role base on friendship and favoritisms. SunTrust the company itself offered great leadership training programs that all managers are required to take but in our department due to the friendship relationship the manager didn’t have to take the training.
good,"There were some great people to work with.  It is a face paced, competitive and stressful environment, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  They strive on excellent customer service."
good,If you do not like having monthly goals and quotas do not work here. Everyone is part of their sales culture and it is what they use to justify not giving you appropriate compensation. Company culture was over all friendly but locations consistently flip flop managers due to lack of interest or performance on their part.
good,Initial job negotiations are good however advancement can be stagnant.  The internal control environment has many challenges and there is a lot of room for improvement from an operational standpoint.
good,"Assist buyer, seller, processor, officer, and closer."
good,"The company focuses on putting the clients first. While doing so, they sometimes lose their appreciation for the teammates that put them there. Like all corporations, there are positives and negatives."
good,"There are some good and bad things about the job overall is a steady paycheck that is not too hard, but provides little advancement. pay could be better, has some perks."
good,"Working through my daily pipeline keeping accounts updated, talking to customers (inbound calls) who want to work with us in bring account current or payoff.  Work projects that are offered by management dealing with accounts that may need to be charged off, re-evaluated for assistance to the consumer etc., talking with our attorneys, and answering emails, taking requests for reinstatement and payoff figures."
good,I appreciate the experience and opportunity SunTrust afforded me.  I was impressed by many things the banking industry offered and was able to utilize the many years of customer service experience with the clients on a day to day basis.
good,Nothing special with the company. The branch that I worked at was wonderful and had a great team which made going into work everyday so much better.
good,"Every branch, location, team, state has a drastically different approach but mostly they all just try to pass the problem along"
good,"Suntrust, is a smaller financial institution. They training is very minimal, and because of the size of the company. The ability to advance is very long journey. They provide outstanding customer service. Their offices are limited, but they're fees are reasonable."
good,"My position varied while employed here. My job functions varied on a daily basis so time management was a very necessary skill. I was tasked to complete my basic job duties, special projects, accounting, and trained/assisted other employees in their functions on a daily basis."
good,"I started as a Teller at Wells Fargo and I used to process transactions like deposits, transfers and cash handling. I was able to get promoted to Personal Banker and that position deal with customer service and sales goals by interacting faced to faced with clients and doing outbound calls."
good,"Providing strides in the industry. Not quite as advanced as the other banks, but should get there in the near future. Developing a footprint in the United States map."
good,The people are great to work with and the clients are amazing. The company or at least the area seems to have a very high turnover rate. Nearly all the branches in the area are short handed and constantly have people coming and going and not due to promotions. Many associates are leaving for other banks or businesses due to better pay and benefits.
good,"You really have to bounce around the company to advance, and they do not pay market rate. Initially they will pay market rate, but the raises are virtually the same for everyone (depending on the department), so they don't necessarily recognize hard work and dedication. Over time, employees find themselves underpaid, unless you are in the bonus pool."
good,ok company everyone for themselves limited promotion. does give sales monthly quarterly. long term in position that you obtain hard to transition.
good,I did enjoy working with the people within the company however i did not like how inconsistent the branches were. I started at one branch and when i was transferred to another branch then I was completely lost because their procedures were different.
good,"The majority of my career was filled with great fulfillment except for the last 5 years. There was a high stress level and insecurity. My team and I made every effort to perform above expectation while creating an environment of highly engaged teammates. I learnt to keep my composure at all times. Every individual is different which requires one to adjust accordingly. I enjoyed assisting my internal and external peers. I also enjoyed being a member of two business resource teams which were instrumental in their volunteer initiatives. The hardest part of my job was having to deliver reduction in force announcements. One had to uphold composure, deliver message and show empathy. This was probably the most stressful part of my job. Strategy changes to meet business needs was stressful during 2008-2011. Acquiring knowledge of our products, services and systems was a highlight for me. It brought significant exposure for being a member of many project teams. Management made many decisions and were slow in disseminating to impacted groups. At times, information was obtained from third party. This created lack of trust for teammates."
good,The hardest part of this job was to get the loans closed. Underwriters were under so much stress to make sure the loans were closed correctly that they had to review the loans before the loans closed
good,"A typical day includes processing reports, tracking Anti-Money Laundering assessments, managing calendars and travel.  I have learned how to have crucial conversations with coworkers.  My management provides opportunities for improvement."
good,"The typical workday involved taking call after call. The system prompts the worker when it's time for break, lunch, meetings, etc. One of the more obnoxious aspects of the job was dealing with the truly irate, belligerent customers who refuse to be happy had a LOT of control over the phone rep's paycheck. There was also a point when the focus shifted from helping customers to nickel-and-diming them with words that sounded like they were solutions when they were really setups for long term problems that would eventually make the bank more money."
good,"A typical work day varied from busy to not so busy , sometimes leaving co workers A LOT of time to not focus on the job"
good,The day began with reconciling cash on hand. Meeting with customers to resolve issues or provide financial products to enhance financial health.
good,the company continues to shift and flip flop always looking for the next pathway to profitability. No commitment to a long term plan for profitable growth. Always putting out a fire or launching a campaign only to be trashed or forgotten about 2 weeks later.
good,Adhere to a schedule most of the day spent on the phone. My co-workers are awesome. They are sending alot of the jobs to Manilla. Hardest part are dealing with the rude clients
good,I do not have much to say about SunTrust.  I had a Manager who used to use me as an example for every new hire in a very disrespectful way.
good,"Each day i get to work, and do some repetitive task, but i have the ability to change my routine during the day. I learned that being different is hard, in my opinion cultural differences can be exciting ,interesting, very insiteful but also suspicious acting and incosiderate of  each other. The hardest part of my job is the knowledge that i do a lot more than what i get paid for and feel very under appreciated at times. But the most enjoyable part is meeting new people everyday sometimes and learning new things about the job and other jobs in the industry."
good,"SunTrust has a great corporate culture, however, there is no real job security. Constant layoffs, everyone who has been there for years has been laid off multiple times.  Pay is decent, but make sure you negotiate walking through the door because increases are very minimal on a yearly basis and are restricted by company set caps."
good,"I worked in a center of specialization that had just been formed. The management was not seasoned and were not very knowledgeable or helpful. "
good,SunTrust hires great teammates (enjoyable part of job) but their upper management techniques do not foster an environment for professional growth (hardest part of job). You are provided the resources to do current position duties but you are not encouraged to seek success outside of your department.
good,"I have learned about the mortgage industry and enjoy my coworkers. I am both the Administrative Assistant and a Mortgage Risk Analyst. My resposibilities in a day vary from administrative work to motgage analyst responsiblities. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with, my coworkers are some amazing individuals that are very talented. The worst part of my job is the constant worry that I will be let go to corporate downsizing."
good,"Working 7 days a week"
good,"Conservative, safe environment that fosters personal growth"
good,"Ok place to work, not somewhere that I will make a career out of. Pay is lower than other banks, many people leave for higher pay."
good,"No micro management, co workers were great. Management kept you informed.  Day to day work flow"
good,I enjoy helping customers and assisting both employees and customers in solving whatever problems they may have.
good,"A typical mortgage company, nice coworkers. Do not  have an efficient system."
good,"8 hours"
good,"I am looking to expand my abilities and have the opportunity for greater advancement.I manage my branch in the areas of operations, HR, coaching and training. I plan for numerous conference calls during the week. I function as the business banker for my branch by serving existing clients and sourcing new business. I assist all clients that come to the branch for their service needs. I also function in a sales role, providing needs based sales for my clients via branch or telephone contact. I enjoy providing for all my clients to see that all their financial needs are met."
good,Very in-tune with micro-managment. Very high tunrover rate. 
good,"A great company, great compensation / benefits, nice culture and values,job security and advancement possibilities, but certain management practices in retail division/region 7, were questionable."
good,"The 2nd Lien Foreclosure Team was developed to meet compliance regulations due to federal changes in banking regulations. Over the 3 years, it was reorganized twice. The last reorganization created a RIF. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with the co-workers and the development of procedures and processes to met the ever changing requirements of the position. The most challenging was the high turnover rate within the department."
good,In a typical day I meet with clients to identify solutions that are best suited for their needs. The hardest part of my job is telling someone they are not qualified for a lending product and the most enjoyable part is the co-workers I work with and when I able to meet a customers financial needs.
good,the job was great except for the lack of security in my position.
good,Overall a good experience working for a bank. Managment lacked in being good but coworkers were great. I learned alot working for a bank.
good,"SunTrust is a good place to work with good co-workers. I am responsible for the selling of bank products like, accounts, loans, referrals, and investment products. The banking world is ever changing."
good,i learned a lot of stuff how to be more professional. and i enjoyed working with my co workers
good,Great job if you have time to kill or aren't looking to climb the corporate ladder.
good,Company diversity & inclusion great. Pay not so great starting  pay lower than market industry. Supervisors micro manage you non stop. Work from home option is  a privelege and is only awarded if  you meet & exceed monthly goals &  customer surveys.
good,"Great teammates, great environment. Was able to work from home most of the time. Helped transform Maximo to ServiceNow was very exciting, yet was very stressful."
good,"Management is the only problem with suntrust and being that management is who run the employee’s and the company, the company as a whole has taken a loss. The management needs to be under reconstruction, needs up to date training of the changes that has take place over years, respect and basically practice what is preached. There needs to be update with computer system and up to date information provided to the representative to provide to the clients"
good,Rather not say how I feel . It is a job I worked there and that is all I care to say. Its a large company who's in the business of employing people don't always agree with how the do business but its just my view.
good,This was a fun place to work. I was able to learn a lot in the short time I was here. The mortgage department needed better management but overall a good experience.
good,"While there are some great departments to work in, they tend to be the minority.  Leadership does not operate under the same criteria as they want implemented and cannot seem to get out of there own way to allow their employeesto efficiently do their jobs.  At this point,  there are too many chiefs and although the teams are aligned to Agile methodology,  leadership fails to operate within that framework. Hide negative"
good,"SunTrust is a Good company to work for.  There are many opportunities for advancement throughout a large banking footprint."
good,"Overall, SunTrust seems to genuinely care about the health, wealth, and wellbeing of its ""teammates"" as there are abundant internal resources.  Technology seems to still be under invested and compensation looks a bit low compared to peers in my space.  The merger with BB&T is obviously creating some disruption and headcount reductions."
good,"A lot o wasted time as management continually shifts their priorities, got out after acquisition with BBT was announced, it was bad before, hear it's worse now.  Needed to get ahead of the exodus."
good,"Hours are very long at SunTrust. There is a very high turnaround rate, due to inadequate training and average management. The job is very demanding with limited opportunities for advancement."
good,The company provides ample opportunities for learning new skills and development but lacks structure around career progression. Young talent retention does not seem to be a focus.
good,Very busy branch would leave teller by themselves on busy time of day to run 3 drive thru lanes and counters made poor customer service new management every few months
good,"I was hired to assist the branch with business community business and their reputation, their current manager was concerned less about anything but herself; she manuplated staff and the branch for her own personal needs."
good,"I worked there for over 25 years and the last few years since the Wells Fargo scandal it has them on a firing frenzy for any little thing teammates are doing wrong.  I understand the need to punish inappropriate behavior, but they have gone from be counsel oriented company to possibly discriminatory termination as a knee jerk reaction.  And I am not talking about theft or manipulation of incentive or fraud losses, that I can understand, but decision making in certain circumstances that could be reversed, something I didn't even know wasn't allowed to do after 25 years of working there."
good,"Objectives are set, but the goalposts are usually moved before any real success can be reached. This is done be changing software platforms and a revolving door of management."
good,"Solo teller acting at drive thru, teller line and safe deposit box, never able to follow my doctors appointments because the branch has only one teller me, during my time working there they hire two tellers in differents ocasions neither stayed they leave for another financial institution!"
good,Behind the times with technology. Management is hesitate about working from home. Parking is expensive. Enjoy the workplace culture. Employees are helpful and social.
good,"Good people, ok products, a challenging work environment in the management ranks. Company has been trying to decide what it should be in the new work of banking.."
good,The lending culture was first rate and positioned you to grow not only as a lender but as a credit administrator. Most of my lender group eventually became Chief Credit Officers at other institutions.
good,"There was no balance of personal and work life. When I told my supervisor at the time that I'd like to work part -time to finish college, she said I should just look for another job."
good,Management is great but there are no opportunities for advancement and raises don’t come that often. Cafeteria is great and the onsite clinic is a plus.
good,SunTrust's requires a lot of improvement in the technology space. A  lot of emphasis is placed of regulatory compliance without the support of upgrade technology. This makes it challenging to work for this company.
good,"Picked advancement. No opportunity for development or advancement. Management picks and chooses who to work with and it is all about who you know.  You can give your all and more, but if you're not ""in"", you have no chance."
good,Constant management changes at all levels caused uncertainty during my employment years 2003 to 2015. Generous compensation and incentive payments offset by poor work life balance. In the end workload was not sustainable.
good,"You really have to have nothing going on in your life for you to be able to work for this call center. Forget about not having a place to stay, forget about your kids, forget about your outside life! Very strict about policy"
good,Heavily regulated; cutthroat environment; heavily micro managed; behind in technology; puts so much emphasis around being “client centric” when the reality is they care more about affluent clients; strong emphasis around client experience often forces employees to take heavy punishment from the clients with no recourse.
good,Enjoyable to work with immediate co workers on day to day operations. I wide variety of individuals with a full range of mortgage operations experience.
good,"The hours in a bank are 8-6. Fast paced. There are sales goals that you have to meet each quarter, if you don't meet the goals then you have to be counseled which made the work environment a hostile at times."
good,The environment was relaxed and had a clinic in the building. I would not discourage anyone from working at Suntrust as there are many departments. It was difficult to maintain a work life balance.
good,"It is a nice place to work, nice buildings, gym, cafe, convenient location, Marta, bus, safe, neat, just if live in north of Atlanta, it will take longer due to the traffic."
good,"7am to 5pm. i learned to become more responsible. the management is good to their staffs. the hardest pat of job are to carry heavy things."
good,SunTrust seems focused on growing their employees in Atlanta. They didn't seem to be on board with continuing the growth of their NC employees. Reduced salaries and early retirement packages continued to happen regularly.
good,"I was acquired by SunTrust Bank when it purchased Huntington Banks.  I worked for them over 12 years.  I had the opportunity to train new employees for other branches and was successful.  The most enjoyable part of my job was building my own clients base, whom I built a relationship of trust."
good,"Like other Corporate entities, they are always restructuring, reorganizing therefore reducing jobs which is why I just lost mine.  I have to wonder if management really understands just how busy we are and how much we contribute to the success of the department.  I feel bad for my co-workers who were able to keep their jobs.  I do not see how the restructuring is going to improve the client experience or lessen the stress and job tasks of my co-workers."
good,Everything is by the book. Not many opportunities for advancement within the organization. There is a lot of favoritism and not a lot of accountability.
good,"I don't find a friend environment. I don't like the company culture."
good,"The SunTrust philosophy became sales at all costs. Goals were designed to force customers to accept products they did not need or necessarily want."
good,Should Invest more in the employees instead of systems. Learn as much as you can in order to cross train and find another department to get more knowledge.
good,"Everyone works hard on your team, management rarely recognizes your hard work.  Morale can be boosted by your manager but if you have a manager that doesn't care, has the attitude of ""its your job"" than you will never feel lifted up in your performance.  Some managers tend to focus on your mistakes and never the accomplishments."
good,"Too many realignments and reorganizations for a team to deliver long term results. Good direction from the most senior management, but the next layer down is a revolving door, resulting in new goals and metrics every year. Relatively easy to find lateral moves, but upward mobility can be challenging."
good,"There are far worse companies to work for.  Speaking for myself, I was fairly (albeit not generously) compensated.  Management at the top of the house has their collective hearts in the right place.  While I benefited from excellent immediate supervisors, middle management blocks the vision of senior management and ties the hands of immediate supervisors."
good,"I did not like that I was hire as a personal banker they told me that I was going to get a branch to be a branch manager within 6 month and that was not true, my manager was not really good, she was not able to developed me as a Branch Manager"
good,SunTrust is a moderately paced organization. It is a good place to stay if you are at the middle or nearing end of your career. Decent projects but too many politics.
good,"SunTrust would be a good company except for company has layoffs/reduction in force annually., There is a  mixed culture of people; i.e. a diverse work place."
good,"To me, working hard is not an option, it's a requirement . I will  always do more than what my job responsibilities ask of me.  "
good,"Overall, it was an ok place to work.  We had just acquired flex hours which was nice.  Management wasn't really in touch with our team.  Wasn't really sure what the end result would be.  Communication was minimal."
good,"I enjoyed the experience and skills that were acquired during my few years as an employee here. However, the work environment and expectations created stressful situations due to the sales related to this position."
good,"Budgeting, forecasting, little strategic or value added analysis.  Just standard reporting and basic variance analysis.  Well paid if you can keep a position."
good,"In my career here at SunTrust a typical day has lots of surprises. Due to nature of my job there are a lot of changes that we have to consider with mortgagee updates, rules and regulations for our investors and decisions made internally. The toughest part of my job is staying on top of  the variety of the changes  to ensure that we are in compliance with both our investors and with SunTrust rules. It can be tough, but we successfully accomplish them. Here at SunTrust leadership skills such as communication, organizational, creativity, strategic planning, motivational and delegation is critical in our environment.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with teammates to ensure we accomplish our team goals."
good,Suntrust is a good company to work for in the financial arena. It needs to work on having more diversity in management. Suntrust is great at helping to further their education by offering classes on its company website.
good,Working for SunTrust was a learning experience. I enjoyed the costumer service aspect however I strongly disagreed with many of the company's policies.
good,"led branch sales and service agenda"
good,"Even though your doing the right thing for the clients, your always getting written up because you're not meeting your goals which keep increasing month after month."
good,"Great Environment Is Banking goals didn't exist. "
good,"not much goal oriented.Short term goals cannot improve the product."
good,"Consistently remained in the top 12% of loan amount kept in personal pipeline averaging $400,000 monthly in loan production throughout First Charter Bank"
good,"I have been a branch manager for over 17 years, I really enjoyed it at first. Love developing a team, a business, and work outside developing business. Its difficult delivering bad news to a teammate or a client."
good,"Enjoyed coming to work!"
good,"This was a great place to work but the management was horrible, hostile and exhibited bullying behaviors. My concerns about management were never taken seriously and I eventually was fired because my supervisor didn't like me. I would still be with the company if I didn't have the manager that I had. Pay is pretty good but should be more for all of the tasks done by CFS Supervisors. Very stressful department to work in when management is not a support but a hindrance to your growth."
good,"•	Provided administrative support to branch manager."
good,Currently I am a senior employee making less than new hire. I just want to be with a company that value and recognize staff. I don't mind working for  what is needed but i need an opportunity.
good,The environment was very uncertain due to layoffs.  People were laid-off frequently.  The threat of downsizing was a tool that was used effectively.
good,I had hopes of advancement when I first started. After seeing numerous coworkers post for positions that they never were able to transfer into I decided that I wanted to look elsewhere.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers clear their debt, enjoyed the hours of operation. Wished there was more opportunity of growth within the company"
good,I loved the people I worked with for the most part. They're pay was great. They were understanding and helpful. My main complaint is that my manager at the time would encourage us to lie to our clients. I found this incredibly troubling.
good,"All in all - lots of nice people and very relaxed.  Contractor process to hire to permanent positions is mystifying to me - no real rhyme or reason who they hire - not seemed to be based on merit."
good,learned to manipulate various mortgage software programs; various documents and how to reconcile escrow and data input for conventional Fannie Mae loans into 571 claim forms.
good,"Suntrust installed so many characteristics in my time there and has helped me better myself as a leader and person , Management needed much improvement but overall a great company to work for."
good,"Very fast passed and never the same day twice. Learned how to be highly self motivating and positive around the individuals that I managed and worked beside. I learned and utilized being highly prioritized and efficient every day. I did not have a single office that I worked out of so I had to be extremely organized and on most days had to move to several different offices to meet with clients. The part of being a Financial Adviser that I found the most difficult was having to work all hours at least 5 days a week, beginning from 7am to 9pm and trying to shuffle around family in order to do so. The most enjoyable part of my job was, by far, my clients and the employees I worked with. I was able to find a great deal of gratification and enjoyment in them."
good,The pay isn't great but you'll gain experience and skills that you'll use throughout your career. The incentive plan was taken away at the beginning of 2015 and they outsourced to the Philippians a lot of departments and many people in the USA lost their jobs.  But working directly with small business clients has provided me resources and skills that I am still using today even though I'm no longer with the company.
good,Management is decent.  Adequate amount of red tape and politics.  Job location is in the greater Atlanta area which is perfect for mass transit or driving.  They have great financial and health based programs for their teammates to thrive.
good,"Bank has good benefits and quickly improving technology. Not much of a future in Credit unless located in Richmond or Orlando, where the centralized lending units are. Even still, much of the functions in those locations are be sent off-shore."
good,"I enjoyed working with clients and developing relationships with my teammates and with clients. I felt like the company generally cared for their employee. SunTrust consistently had a lot of initiatives for teammates. However, the company is so large that you still felt like just a number and no one knew anyone. The stress was unbearable."
good,"Sales goal measurement do not match company mission statement. Claim to put the client first, but after account opening all issues are pushed off to someone else. Do not have the opportunity to foster the client relationship as needed unless it will result in a sale."
good,"My normal day consisted of "
good,"I loved it in Florida! Good benefits, training, and nice hours. I had an excellent manager. Love helping clients with their financial needs!"
good,If you like selling and being held to production this is the place to look for employment. Good benefits and goal oriented bonus.
good,A team oriented company and loves working with everybody in and out of my department. One team mentallity but everybody is held accountable for their own work.
good,"Take calls as they come in to help the client do things like change address, update phone numbers, reorder checks, get balances, empowered to refund fees and offer clients products and tools to help them make their money grow. Also have to opportunity to train others to do the job. Help the advance as a team mate."
good,"I enjoyed talking to my customers. The hardest thing I had was being pushed to make sales and referrals. My coworkers were great to work with, but management from the hierarchy was unrealistic."
good,"A fun place to work  enjoyed working with the majority of  co-workers,Nice environment to work in"
good,Suntrust is a great company to work for as far as I am concerned. However there is talk of outsourcing and I want to find something new before we all get laid off
good,"They'll tell you you loads of great sounding things in the interview, but none of it happens."
good,My upper management only cares about sales and was told we are all replaceable
good,Very close knit and hard to navigate sometimes. The company moves very slow when it comes to making decisions and is behind other banks related to technology.
good,The agency will get you where you want to be but no further advisement after that.
good,Assisted customers with their banking necessities and reviewed loan applications with them.
good,Every LOB has its own set of rules/policies. Departments have changed from quality to quantity.
good,"I was able to produced a good level of business, but the support staff to process these loans was weak which restricted sales."
good,The daily grind can be a bit of a bear but at the end of the day it feels good to know that you're helping borrower's get what they need to get done. You do feel like you grind a lot and don't get a lot of recognition for it. The pay isn't terrible when you get your bonus at the end of the month.
good,"I enjoyed the job, i liked feeling like i helped people, but the environment was too competitive and not in a healthy way."
good,The company was good. I received what I believed was a better job offer. Since then the industry has slowed and the job stability concerns are at the forefront of my future.
good,Working at SunTrust Bank was very challanging with strict deadlines to achieve
good,"The company is ok to work for. The people are great. Some managers tend to mico-manage. "
good,"I loved working for SunTrust, I always felt that they had my best interest in mind and I felt that I had room for advancement."
good,"teller  and customer service specialist. training was good detailed, coworkers were unwelcoming. Being new to the industry was not given support to do the job."
good,"SunTrust Banks, Inc. served as a great place to learn the rudimentary aspects of the banking business.  They provided me with an opportunity to learn and practice great customer service and client retention.  Being a home town bank, the most enjoyable experience was the client loyalty."
good,A typical day is very fast paced and demanding. What I learned the most is how to multitask and solve customer problems.My manager and co-workers are easy to work with.The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and Learning new things.There is no hard part of ths job.
good,"I enjoyed this job  because I love to work with people and love  work in that area where I can demonstrate my abilities, and learn from others."
good,Great Company but poorly managed department. Your experience will be totally based on the management style of your superiors.
good,It was okay. Telecommuting made it hard to have much physical contacts
good,SunTrust is a solid working environment. The typical is very busy filled with customers to assist and issues to resolve. Like most employers the management varies in their abilities.
good,"The work day is full of multi-tasking activities, much was learned about the bank and its focus"
good,"As an Integration Engineer,I spend the major of my time researching, documenting and implementing Enterprise business solutions to achieve the overall business objectives set-out by management. These systems vary from tools to business applications which support various LOB's (Lines of Business)."
good,"I enjoy working directly with the clients and helping their with their needs, however sales is not my forte."
good,The company is okay place to work. I would recommend the company to others
good,"Review staffing needs,Forecasting, make post schedule staffing needs based on current deviations."
good,"The company relied on old values, however was improving on its culture and new values."
good,"I enjoyed working at Suntrust, my colleagues were very nice and professional. It was a great environment to work and grow professionally."
good,Its a decent company to work for. I've been here for 10 years but just ready to a change...its kind of hard to climb the ladder within this company sometimes.
good,"Like other big companies, there can be a lot of down time - especially if you finish your work faster than estimated. It still was a nice place to work. There really isn't a culture to speak of, just corporate life."
good,It is a good place to start and provides decent salary and work life balance. It is hard to understand and navigate to growth opportunities once you have reached a certain level.
good,Very approachable leadership
good,Provide customer service and cash handling to customers. Meet the needs for optimum customer satisfaction and acted as ATM custodian.
good,Co workers are great to work with.
good,Large pipelines to manage keeps the atmosphere very high paced. Mulitasking is a must. I use time-blocking to be more productive. Communication is key with Loan Officer and Borrowers.
good,It was a great job while in training but as soon as the real job started that quickly changed. Customers were usually always rude but that was expected. Some of the managers were not always on the same page. It wasn't a team oriented place like they claimed to be. Majority of my co-workers were not happy there and they have a high turnover. The benefits were great and they did have potlucks and recognition ceremonies. The job overall was stressful and not a great place to work. I dreaded working there everyday.
good,Neutral. My coworkers are great and we care about each other
good,"I enjoyed working at suntrust, very friendly staff.my co workers were very helpful"
good,I started as a teller I in May of 2008. The company trains you to learn their products.The company has enjoyable hours. The company provides all the tools needed.
good,I had the opportunity to assist banking customers with their accounts as well as recommending and cross selling banking products.
good,great people to work with but there is not much room for advancement
good,I think very highly of SunTrust Bank and its management. It is nearly impossible to move to another division of the bank. Upward mobility is extremely competitive.
good,"If you are a results focused manager and would like to spend your time and resources to create value for company and help grow business, you will find yourself to push against a heavy and messy door."
good,"Buddy system atmosphere... a lot of favoritism going on. If you don't live in ATL or have connects already there, good luck trying to go from contractor to full time."
good,"Not terrible, not great It is a job with decent benefits and will get you by in a pinch.  The people that have been there awhile seem happy enough but it can get pretty soul crushing."
good,Time management is critical in working at investment processing.  The hardest part of the job is deterring fraud.  Great colleagues and systems make this job fantastic.
good,"I was able to grow and work my way up in the company (position and salary).  "
good,"A typical day at work was complex and high pace"
good,"You have to sell sell sell and don't even get much compensation for it, I sold a $250k mortgage and received $20 bucks. Wow! I don't feel that keeping people in debt is ""helping"" them but that's what all big banks are about. I didn't like it at all, it bothered my conscience."
good,OK company. A little below market value for pay. Technology is behind. Work life balance is good for a bank. Culture is not consistent from department to department
good,"Have to multitask and being able to do more than one thing at a time. Had great benefits, and has alot of departments to work your way up. People are very friendly."
good,stayed VERY busy when focusing on refinances for sun trust customers. I do not recommend this job if you don't have thick skin as some customers can b
good,This isnt the dream work place. There is no innovation and all systems are outdated. The lack of communication from management and high turnover keep employees unmotivated. If you do not meet a benchmark you get one warning and on to the net employee. I had to leave because management over me wanted me to let go of great talent.
good,"This was a quick turn around due to downsizing within the company. The staff worked well together in solving problems. Unfortunately, wasn't around long enough."
good,Working for Suntrust was a great experience and was my first banking job and the start to a long career in banking industry. I learned a lot while being a teller there .
good,"Fast pace environment, learn as you go, opportunity for advance based on relationship with managers, good location, job security, limited training, good compensation package"
good,"A little bit status quo. Not really receptive to new ideas, team input, and process refinements. Poor instructions given. Little to no training provided."
good,Great place to learn technology stack and supportive work environment. Work life balance at SunTrust is not there as we have to support during the weekend and late nights.
good,Working with banks can be an exercise in turning off your brain and learning to check the box like a good employee.  Suntrust can have a lot of this mindset depending upon the department you work within.
good,I work in customer care in a call center helping clients with their checking accounts anything accounts related with helping fix all problems and needs. I love helping people. Work with computers all day. Got a wonderful job offer at Health Connect America.
good,"The only issue with this job is unless you are hyper driven and looking for that dog-eat-dog office world type job, you won't move anywhere or even get full time. If you are for that kind of lifestyle then you will go far in this job and make great money."
good,"I enjoyed working for Suntrust. Management was nice and caring. I was contract, but I would have loved the opportunity to work full time permanent for them."
good,Good pay but staffing is always a concern.  Be prepared to jump in and start quickly even though there is a structured training program that says you shouldn't.
good,"I was a Private Financial Advisor and SunTrust Investment Services. This company is trying to excel in it's industry and be a resource for it's clients. However, the reality is that wealth management was an afterthought and banking is (understandably) their primary focus. Because of this, there are some impediments to success. For example, their bank software isn't integrated with their wealth management software which means that bank employees may try to refer a client to you who you've already spoken with. On the upside, If you are in a small market, you may have some autonomy since your direct supervisor will likely not be on-site. All branches are different, so the nature of your work environment, lead quantity/quality, and other factors vary from location to location. Not a bad company or a good starting point as an advisor but you will get bored here if you have any experience in the industry."
good,"training isn't long its fast and what you need to know. there's always help if you reach the right people. Sales goals for sure, as teller building connections with clients is key for referrals!"
good,"Company provided good work life balance.  The management was supportive.  The job environment was good.  The culture was good.Really nice people to work with,."
good,"This company offers learning opportunities, advancements, and employs positive individuals. "
good,"SunTrust was a challenging place to work.  The technology was either approaching or already in an End of Life (EOL) status, making it difficult to support lines of businesses and customers."
good,Always something to jump into day to day. Discovering and highlighting data anomalies that have never been reached before by a financial institution. bringing them to the for front and then optimizing campaigns to heighten revenue growth. Management was kind of all over the place so we each grab the reins on individual and team projects regrouping weekly to ensure we are on task!
good,I learned a lot about the Foreclosure process while working at SunTrust Mortgage it give me the experience that is needed to pursue another job in the same field if I was interested.
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Suntrust; they train you and they offer a competitive salary. The company culture is always about the client, they are very specific of how you will do things and what needs to be said. Conversations are almost scripted."
good,Opportunities are offered for advancement. Working for SunTrust can be challenging and rewarding at the same time.  Most employees make a career at SunTrust.
good,This bank had the potential to be a good work environment. The problem was that the management were too interested in their own promotion rather than building a team of good bankers.
good,"Work ranged between dull, somewhat interesting, and fascinating. Pay was fair and method of advancement and pay increase was fair. Culture could be somewhat stressful, environment became harsh at times. Corporate America truisms. If you want to play the game and know how, you might do very well here."
good,Not applicable. I do not want to provide my review regarding Suntrust. Thankful for the opportunity to work at Suntrust. No other comments needs to be added
good,"Depending on your department/manager depends on your benefits for flexibility. Some departments offer to ability to work remotely a few days a week or a flexible work week like 4 10 hour days Always a lot of  robotics, outsourcing and reorganizing in large banks..."
good,"Opening accounts, loans and introducing clients to our partners for more services provided within the company. The daily calls were very tedious and didn't really amount to success"
good,"A typical work day would be to visit 5 branches and meet with customers refinancing or purchasing homes. The programs used would be FHA, VA, or conventional."
good,"A typical day at SunTrust was quiet, family oriented and busy. SunTrust is a big company so there were plenty of advancement opportunities. The most enjoyable part of my job was having great training. The hardest part of the job was watching things change and knowing that sooner than later your department would be laid off."
good,Learned a lot. very encouraging environment. compensation at par with work environment. helped me a lot and provided great opportunities to advance my prospects.
good,"A fairly nice place to work, nice offices, but too quick to eliminate jobs vs. keeping skilled/experience employees. Management is Ok, some are strict with rules and regulations while others are more laid back. Most of the co-workers make it an enjoyable day at work."
good,a decent place to work. too many daily meetings instead of processing. fairly decent salary. at the end processors was centralized to another location forcing people to be laid off
good,"This was an good company i worked here in my 20s and created a lot of great friendships, I learn many skill here  related to bankruptcy and law. the company is good but lacks structure, management teams are well train to help associates"
good,"SunTrust was an overall nice call center to work for. Very goal oriented, if goals not met would have coachings to help improve. They were excellent in rewarding staff."
good,Worked here for many years. It went from a client driven atmosphere to a sales driven profit approach. It's a decent starter job and can become a career. But growth can be challenged due to company politics with branch management.
good,Underwrote two loans a day and met regular quality control requirements. Their systems when I work there was a old DOS operating cumbersome system which made hard to keep production.
good,Don't really have anything to say about the conditions.  Some management better to work with depending on location.  Not consistent with policy per office. Great training.
good,"I enjoyed working there , the staff were nice. they just did not have enough hours to work. it was nice helping the customers, the company, the  staff"
good,"The company culture, at least in the Treasury Product group, was very challenging.  We had several changes in leadership, and it was not uncommon for someone on our team to be fired/laid off and you didn't realize until you came in on Monday and their cubicle was empty.  It was difficult to trust your teammates."
good,"SunTrust was a decent place to work, and the job was originally pleasant and challenging, but management was lacking in empathy or communication skills."
good,"A typical day had to be productive because the job was judge on productivity and very stressful.  What I learned was when Suntrust started being on productivity the company seem to not be family oriented anymore.  Management did not seem to care about the employees anymore, it kind of got cut throat. Hardest part was wonder were you going to have a job or not if you did not make productivity for the month.  The most enjoyable part of the job  was when you had a comical moment with an coworker."
good,"Branch was always operating with a staff shortage. "
good,Experience varies widely by the group or segment of the company. Frequent shuffling and reorganization at the executive level creates a feeling of instability.
good,"At Suntrust, they would send in a ""clean up team"" when they figure numbers were low (very numbers based). Senior management would come in and implement new policies without knowing the actual job requirements causing confusion among everyone."
good,spoke with a n average of 80 clients a day. gave balances to mortgages for required sales. management doesn't back you on some horrible clients. I have been cussed out more times than I can count.
good,"A typical day at work entailed calling clients to sell different products and due to the location of the branch, the management could not understand how difficult it was to sell certain products to the clientele."
good,"SunTrust truly believes in financial confidence and helping their clientele grow financially confident. While benefits are provided, and internal growth is promoted... SunTrust could work on providing a more equitable pay for their employees."
good,"Suntrust pays less than many of its competitors.  The senior staff will constantly remind of that and encourage you to seek out alternatives, which is very discouraging."
good,"I did contract work at Sun-trust.  People are nice and very helpful in training. Management is flexible with work from home. I feel it is harder to become a full time employee., when you contract for Sun trust."
good,"Large mid size regional bank. Plenty of jobs but was a grind at times. Convenient location downtown Richmond. Management is ok, some good, some bad managers"
good,The onup movement allowed me to learn how to proactively set goals for have an overall financial well being. It also allowed me to develop my team and encouraged them to save more and invest more in their own future.
good,"Flexible work schedule, pleasant work environment, team players, satisfaction of assisting customers and resolving their issues; Employee Appreciation."
good,"Not a great company,  good ole boy network. Difficult to move up in company if you don't fit their idea image. I would not recommend this company if you're a minority."
good,"Working there was great in the beginning.  It trained me on all of the tools I needed to move on to another financial institution.  Towards the end of my career with them, they had changed their objective about clients customer service.  We were no longer allowed to become personable with them.  It was a get them in and get them out attitude."
good,"This is a cutthroat company. The training you receive is fast and inadequate. Be prepared to have other banker's try to take your clients and steal your sales."
good,SunTrust has giving my the ability to grow and develop myself as a professional. They have many programs from not only their clients but their employees too.
good,"In the department I worked at, if you weren't part of a 'click' you didn't go anywhere. I was trained to be a backup for a job, and when the full time position opened up for that same job I was no selected. Someone who never did that job got it because she was friends with the right people. Not a good experience. Dept was not staffed properly."
good,"It was too many years ago to evaluate it.  There would be different managers, policies etc.  I cannot evaluate this employer.  I did enjoy it while I was there."
good,"This was a tough position. You were inside Krogers and looked at as ""a secondary bank."" Did not get much banking experience but fully received teller experience. Left to learn how a traditional bank operates."
good,A lot of regulation in banking. Work place atmosphere not condusive to any type of interaction that did not specifically pertain to work. Very unfriendly environment
good,"Started work at 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM with 30 minutes for lunch, reviewed MIN's/Loan numbers in Computer systems and corrected information that was incorrect in the systems to make both systems match legal papers. I learned what Mortgage Electronic System, Inc. is and how all the mortgage documents play a big part of how mortgage loans are valued. My manager was great to work with. Culture of SunTrust was great. Hardest part of my job was to keep all the reports that Rejects and Warnings  reports had in common with each other and how they all where to be corrected, I oved everything about my job it kept you on your toes."
good,"My position at SunTrust offers opportunities to learn and exercise my fiduciary knowledge, but just not enough. In addition the technology is below par."
good,"Liked working Mon-Fri, some Saturdays. Very sales oriented with crazy goals and mandatory cold calling after hours. Opportunities for advancement I suppose, but not worth sacrificing my home life."
good,Your employees you work with are great but the job you do is very stressful and if you do not do your job right you will lose your job. There are some managers who train you the wrong way and you lose your job because it was done wrong.
good,"The mortgage division sucked. Constant change, high levels of stress and an inability to work with UW Mgr. She was not employee oriented or caring of the staff."
good,"I really enjoyed my position I was hired to do and the people. My supervisors were fair and honest. After working several years in the department I was hired to work in I was also helping in another department. I continued to excel in the department I was hired for, but didn't any the other one. I have excellent work ethics and willing give my all, but I also know my limitations."
good,"Greeted customer and handled their banking needs.  Exchanged currency for customers traveling out of town.  Processed money orders, and cashier checks.  Sold services and items that would help customer.  Balanced cash drawer daily and also balanced the"
good,I left because they had a bunch of temps including myself and after a year I was still not hired. They had let other temps go at a year. I left because I felt that they would never hire me.
good,The overall experience was a fair one and I did enjoy my clients. The goals for  a UV were almost not achievable for the location i worked in.  Like I said before I really liked the clients and they made it worth it. I do recommend applying just prepared for an interesting environment that pushes really hard on banker and teller scripts.
good,"The best part of SunTrust is the people. Both the employees and customers became more like family. Most teammates are focused on doing their part to service the customer.  The current corporate culture is focusing on increasing automation. My fear is that many older customers will not embrace the new automation changes. However, I wish all the best to the awesome employees I leave behind."
good,"Moring meeting on updates and than get ready for the call's to come in from the Q.. I learned there were a lot of options for people who fell behind with there payment. As per our management team they were fair across the board, it seemed to take them a bit longer to get things resolved. "
good,good company to work for. pay rate is low compared to other banks in the area. growth opportunity is there. teamwork is a must. paid vacations provided
good,"In my department your work did not go unnoticed. You were very much given notice for your talents. However it almost seemed that you more recognized for your mistakes or what you did not do in opposed what you did do."
good,"Typical day involves problem solving for customers and managing sales target."
good,"SunTrust is a typical banking culture. As a company, they're looking at their bottom line, period. "
good,"Good company but poor management, after long time employment not treated like individual but just another number. Said they care about the teammates but not an accurate statement."
good,Teller job was okay. I still had to up sell products not as intense as other banking companies good starter job low pay in comparison to other banking companies
good,Wide variety of people to interact with. Reorganizations take place very often which means that you are working within a new group and possibly on new applications. Reasonably good benefits.
good,Well compensated but stressful. Compensation is good and SunTrust teammates are very committed to doing a good job. Expense reduction initiatives have led to demanding workloads.
good,"Fun Enviroment, always building morale, company outings, luncheons , and skill building , SunTrust offers benefits and 401k as well. 2 weeks vacation your first year."
good,This is a great company to work for if you want to be in a sales oriented company. SunTrust is following the same path as all the bigger banks in this aspect. Quite a bit of non-sense reporting and extra hours for calling or conference calls. The upper management roles are forced into a micro management style for tracking the branches' success. Call nights are not optional and can be called as quickly as the day of.
good,"Worked in a Grocery store setting; like working in a closet."
good,At SunTrust it's not what you know but who you know.  They are very clickish.  If you are not in with the correct people you won't last long there.  I particularly don't like the way they treat their seasoned elderly employees.  It's like push them out the door quick or they're looking for an excuse to get rid of old employees.  You have to stay on top of them with your time and money.
good,Once your day starts there will always be things that are repetitive but always be open to new processes and for something different to happen each day. I learned to always cover your work with documentation.
good,Irrelevant information on my search for a new position. Would like to proceed with finishing all info needed in order to start looking for a new career.
good,Great overtime and early shifts. Only hires temps and it seems as if you need to buy the team lead Starbucks everyday in order to be hired. Management does not engage with employees they stay in their offices.
good,"When I worked there, sales goals is all anyone ever talked about. I understand that has changed to a more service-oriented firm. I wouldn't not work there again"
good,"As long as you can ""find their need"" (sell) then you will do fine. The employees are great, management tries to be helpful. It is a stressful job, but overall a good job."
good,Various leadership initiatives are always driving change. Federal compliance and guidelines ensure that change is constant driving multiple high visibility initiatives.
good,"Great company to work for though can be factory robot setting. Must complete goals and know your stuff. Very little time to train.They like to clock watch. They love to have meetings about meeting. Seemed like we were having meeting about the banks success. We get it SunTrust you are a big bank, now can the staff get back to work and complete the goals you set us."
good,Suntrust is a company where you can grow into your career. You provide hard work and dedication and your efforts will not go unnoticed. Be a team player with focus.
good,a typical day at work starts with pulling reports and setting the tone for my day.  If I am lucky and will make it thru my list of to-do's before the clients start coming in for service.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping clients.  There is nothing more satisfying and turning an irate client into a satisfied client.
good,"Good workplace get a head start to  a career in banking. Work place is conducive to learning. Work load can be heavy and overwhelming at times and stressful, but teammates are there for support."
good,"There was very little overtime needed to perform my job successfully.   The work/life balance was great.  Also, the offices were state of the art and very conducive to working with others or alone. Management was not present to advise on problems with work.  Assignments were not delegated properly."
good,"Suntrust mortgage is a decent company to work for if you want to gain experience, however, there is not a lot of room for growth. It is a great place to work for someone that is new to the workforce."
good,"There is a lot of freedom within some of the roles if you are a hard worker who likes to be creative and take on tasks with your own ideas this is a good fit.  Issue is that there are a few employees who skate by with no sense or desire to accomplish anything and management seems hamstrung to manage them out.  Additionally, there are many rules in place that make promotions and raises near impossible without being deeply impacted in your pay and role if you try and work up from the bottom.  They lose a lot of talent because of it.  If you are coming in as middle management or an analyst you should be fine."
good,"Bank tellers are notoriously low paid. When I worked there they were also cutting back bonuses. Every year my raise didn't cover the amount the insurance increased, so I took home less every year I was employed."
good,The bank is constantly understaffed so the workload is often added on to the current employees. Usually work over 40 hours in a week because of lack of staff.
good,"A typical day is very busy, we take several clients. The tasks performed have a very wide range, and we meet all kinds of people."
good,"Part time job, very limited hours...very stressful.  Had to push sales as a teller...Liked working with the people and handling the money. Did not like having to meet a quota as far as sales calls."
good,My boss was of India culture and did not really spend much time with me. I was really left in the dark about a lot of things. The job was almost 90% calendaring work. Not what I expected.
good,Suntrust bank has a typical bank feel. Customer Service is standard and depends on what branch you go to. The workplace culture is what you would expect at a bank. The customers are what truly made the job rewarding.
good,"We worked together all day and every day Monday thru Friday, we worked well together and helped customers all day with deposits and cashing checks. We referred products to help Bank. We helped a lot of people with foreign money and getting into safety deposit boxes. Great team of people, we all were stressed about making goals for the Bank but we did well."
good,while working there I had alot of ups and downs the business as a whole was good but some of the people not so much some of the managers had those God complexes
good,"Career change job. On the job training was great since I was coming from a completely different background and training. "
good,I definitely was very excited about coming to SunTrust but its just not all it made to be. the customers are very rude and SunTrust does nothing to protect there employees
good,I learned alot working for this company. Plenty of advancement and/or relocation opportunities. Teamwork. I really appreciated this company for the opportunity.
good,Pleasant work environment but job security is difficult to maintain. Management and co-workers are great. The compensation and benefits are good but not a lot of time off for vacation or sick time.
good,My department is the escalation department we deal with all the client that request to speak to a manager when there is a problem that the first level Representative can not resolve.
good,"I worked as an Front Service Rep for a few months. The role was inside a grocery store. It was almost like working the food court in a grocery store except with room for advancement and you wear a suit. Also add on a sales component when you are a banker which means pressure to meet a quota."
good,"Company was good,but I really cant explain as I was not there long enough. It seemed like a good company.I would go back but they are since out of business I believe"
good,"Pleased with company benefits and time off, due to many branches closing in my area there was not much room to grow with the company. In 9 years my branch had 7 different branch managers."
good,"SunTrust seems to be a growing company Since I left in 2001, I have noticed that SunTrust has expanded up the East Coast. Overall, the banking industry has taken a hit as more people tend to bank online."
good,"The team mindset is very strong within this company. Within my team, we all blended really well. I have enjoyed working for this company thus far. It has helped develop me personally and professionally."
good,Everyday is different. Some people are nice and helpful. The management is not in tune with the work that analyst do. A lot of work especially in the Treasury Department. I wish they paid more for the amount of work that the bankers do.
good,"Very busy bank with high quotas that are near impossible. I did not enjoy this environment. Management seemed very stressed. I would recommend this job to someone that is looking for first time teller experience,"
good,a typical day at Sun Trust Bank. verify all information is received before moving to underwriters. If not reach out to business banker to get needed information. The hardest part of my job is retrieving information before deadline. see the recognition at the end of the month for making out goals.
good,This position would be fine if you're good at collecting money and being a bill collect- ER following strict guidelines on what to say during conversations as well as time on call
good,It has been good for awhile. Management has been alright the company has done some restructuring since the Wells Fargo situation. I just feel it could more professionally and fell less like I'm in high school...other than doing my job i hsve to worry about what is being said to others that will either get twisted around or back to other people. I have never dealt with something like this before high school or work place...
good,I was employed at Suntrust when I was like 20 years old. The job was a great experience and gave me the push I needed to go into the world of working.
good,Temporary position training for what to do was not very thorough and they change you to a department they did not train you for without notice then you are lost
good,Run transactions every day. Management will probably change because there are a lot of turnovers in retail banking. The hardest part is dealing with the rude customers and the most enjoyable part is the schedule.
good,Need more innovative processes.  Unmatched with the industry as far as processing.  Need to have things that will make it easier for the customer to do business with us.
good,"Not a good experience. Terrible origination systems. Lazy co-workers. Terrible Manager, stayed in her office and did not discipline staff who were late, taking care of personal business during work hours."
good,This organization is somewhat behind the times when it comes to technological advances and keeping up with modern trends and technology. It causes clients and customers to seek business elsewhere.
good,"Leveraged finance is the bread and butter of SunTrust and is easily the hardest working group in the bank. You do pretty well and if I could turn back the clock, I probably would have stayed in this group."
good,"It was an OK part time job. It helps to get your feet in the door for commercial banks. To learn the culture, and how banking front line dealing with customers face to face was helpful."
good,Met wonderful people this positions was a sales type position getting clients to commit to opening accounts and applying for credit cards car loans and mortgages. I hated the sales part of the job but love meeting new people
good,"There's a great work-life balance, the people are great, however there is little advancement opportunities. The managers are friendly, they really value teamwork."
good,Retail Banking Job.  Suntrust Bank was a good Company while I worked there but has been to long to give a proper review now.
good,SunTrust is a very stable company with good benefits and was a pleasure to work there.  The Teammates and environment were a great experience.
good,An extensive banking network with investment opportunities for professional growth. One of Atlanta's most desirable companies to work for young professionals entering the workforce.
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to help and meet clients; depending on the day this can also be the worst part of the job. This is with any job that deals with customers though. Suntrust is not a bad place to work at and the opportunity to move up is there.
good,"worse part is the never ending pressure, during my training class we were rushed onto the phones not enough training or guidance. it is a good work environment and great place to work they just need to work out some kinks"
good,"This Company is below average. They have decent benefits and 401 k package that matches at 6% and they start you off with 10 days (2 weeks vacation). You aren't eligible for sick days until 6 months in, which at that point you will receive 5 sick days. "
good,"basic teller duties, opening and closing the bank, processing customer transactions. regular training to keep under regulation, high turnover. There is not enough growth within the company to move up quickly."
good,I was a member of the call center's management team.  We had great people in the Nashville center until the work was outsourced to the Philippines.  There was a greater emphasis on sales and that became more of the focus.
good,"good place to network, learn great new things.  plenty of room to grow.  the coworkers are the best part of the company.  if you want to know more then go work there yourself."
good,"As long as you perform your job duties, this place can be considered ""decent"". I've worked at numerous branches, which means I've experienced different work ethics of different managers. I would not recommend anyone to work. Seniority overruled great performance. Managers are given positions based on who they know and NOT their abilities to perform their job functions."
good,Awesome company but bottom line came first and often at the expense of the employees. Fun place to work a well thought out corporate environment. Benefits are excellent.
good,Typical day of processing transactions and making deposits. I did learn a lot on the banker side of things which was a nice asset. But there is no room for advancement.
good,"Definitely was a great place to get work experience and to understand corporate america, as they say. Helped me develop a certain level of professionalism that I do not take for granted."
good,Their bonus structure is hard to understand! If you meet all the quotas you still might not get a bonus. Its hard to get a bonus
good,"Typical day at Suntrust was fun and exciting,"
good,"Productive workplace."
good,Behind in technology which makes it difficult to keep good teammates.  Payscale is low if you move up through the ranks and do not come in from the outside.
good,"We had group fun activities like quiz,in door games and dummy acting of fellow team members whenever we are done with our regular office activities."
good,Company has good benefits but they are sells pushy and have no room to grow. It is very hard to get promoted within the company and they like to hire outside of the company instead of promoting within
good,"Very busy the people make the job enjoyable.  The company tends to reorganize a lot which cause a lot of confusion for the teammates.  Also, means a lot of review of previous work completed causing delays in work being completed timely."
good,The company has room for growth and development. I think SunTrust is good in certain sectors of banking. Global Trade has room to grow if they want to compete against bigger banks
good,Suntrust is a good place to work. I learned new skills since I gained employment here. Typical day was logging into my computer and reviewing documents.
good,"I enjoyed working here and held a couple of ""job titles"". I was a teller and ATM custodian,,,which is a very stressful job.  My co-workers were like ""family"" and the work environment was great! Upper management was hard to please."
good,"Worked for SunTrust Bank for 11 years.  My time there was great.  The co-workers got a long and worked as a team.  Learned how to manage time and be an independent worker.  Loved helping clients meet their financial goals.  Whether opening an account for the first time, entering a loan that has been approved, or helping them use their online banking and billpay.  Enjoyed referring clients to the correct line of business to help them invest in their future through retirement options or purchasing their first home."
good,WHile I was at Suntrust mortgage. The role of Home Preservation Specialist. I was there at the start of the transition from being an inbound loss mitigation call center from have multiple calls come in to having assigned accounts. The assigned accounts allowed personal relationships to build on a business status with the customer vs being just a phone call. Working directly with the customer allowed the process to complete more smoothly.
good,"I,m a teller supervisor, I manage 2 tellers. Its a typical day at the branch. I oversee the operations of the branch as well has handling a cash drawer. I love being a teller supervisor I've been doing it 6 years now."
good,"I worked at Suntrust after a 10yr stay at home raising my 3 children."
good,"I learned a lot about the banking industry in the operations side. Management was good, co workers were good.  Hardest part of the job was the moving from one area to another area.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers."
good,I do not wish to review this bank or my work experience on the internet.  I will provide any details requested when interviewed.
good,"For the most Suntrust is a good place to work. I have learned a lot of the 8 years that I have been there. Of course like other companies there are some things that could be fixed;. But of the most back its okay,"
good,Temporary assignment and that is pretty much all it was. The people I worked with refused to help or train me in fear of them losing their own job. However; it was not a bad place to work at all.
good,"Initially a great environment for learning and advancement; however, a cultural change in departmental management occurred in the last year which no longer promoted growth and development for senior staff members.  ."
good,"Very quiet office with little to no interaction except by phone. Always a busy day with client reviews, compliance updates, and projects from operations.  Health benefits are disheartening."
good,"The major issue with Suntrust is that their hardware and software is ancient. They use several old software programs which are slow, clunky, buggy, and clunky. Area mangers hammer employees to sell, sell, and sell some more. The worst issue with Suntrust is their helpline for employees. Rude is too nice of a word. The people you work with are great mostly, but there are plenty of people who are impressed with their title."
good,"Outbound calling, Customer Service, Deep diving into clients needs, Hands on learning. Opening accounts, manage a team. Surprise audits, balancing vault, daily goals. Meeting Quarterly goal. Adding value to the team. Team player. Taking ownership. Coaching team. Balancing cash drawer."
good,"I worked for the office of the CIO, which, as a bank, they misunderstood. Unfortunately, they hired a inexperienced CIO that continues to fail them. In 2016, they continue to be behind their peers in technology. They have some great people there, but to advance to an executive role you must be a YES person, not a thought leader. Thought is not required with STI, and often unappreciated. Considering their mistakes, it's no wonder they spend tens of millions of dollars on IT yet see little to no change/growth."
good,"Good working conditions and decent hours. Management was tricky to deal with sometimes. Most head tellers were glad to get my help, but some of the managers expected too much."
good,"Great job, but not to much stability with the company due to the annual layoffs theres no room to grow within the company I disagree with the layoffs especially if your a great worker who does overtime and volunteer work a lot."
good,"17 Years of Expert Leadership, Build and Lead Operations Team,  Developing Operational Excellence Programs for Customer Service Strategies, Execute Training and Development Plans for Associates, Microsoft Word/Excel, Contract Management, Manage and Resolve Employee Relations Issues, Administering Attendance Policies/Family Medical Leave Process, Call Center Management utilizing Avaya CMS Supervisor Console,."
good,Good people to work with. Plenty of company tool to help your career. You have to be patient for advancement in operations.
good,"A typical day was similar to the movie Office Space. Management isn't very trusted for a variety of reasons, but you can occasionally find great managers. Medical and 401(k) benefits are great, but the salary was lacking for the amount of work that was increasingly expected of everyone. I've heard about departments that were great and departments that were worse."
good,"Suntrust, in comparison to prior companies I worked for, provided a much more relaxed and comfortable work experience. I was generally content. The downside to Suntrust, at least the team I was on, is that there is no clear path of advancement, so someone with ambitions may feel straightjacketed in their role."
good,"Nothing flashy extra or different . They offer all the basics like VA's, fixed and indexed annuities and mutual funds etc. The work is average but you do have a lot of flexibility."
good,"super high call volume, large call center, strenuous job description. not very good incentives but over time if you want. and advancement depending on your work ethic."
good,"I love working for this company , the company has employee stability problems. In short they lay off too frequently. I love the work that I do and love to be a fulltime permenitt employee. I am an operational analyst; I review documents."
good,Overall a good place to work.  A typical day consists of taking calls from other associates with questions about products and procedures
good,"I enjoyed working for suntrust , sorry they eliminated my job position."
good,"Strong focus on Third Party Risk Management."
good,Working with the Suntrust customers on a daily basis is what helped my day going at this job. The interactions with them were very enlightening.
good,"Had to provide excellent customer service as well as meet the bank individual goals. From time to time we had to use outbound calls to reach financial goals. The bank is a sale driven business, and sometimes it is challenging to reach financial goals in a struggling economy."
good,Overall had a pleasant work environment with friendly workers. Had sales performance goals for non sales and service positions. If you were in a service position and didn't meet sales goals you were written up.
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers I have worked with some great teams.  They helped me learn, gain experience and to become successful."
good,Good overall experience and dynamics with Corporate clients.  The internal culture is also good.  The development of junior staff is a highlight.
good,"All about the numbers and pay is not competitive. Caring co workers."
good,This is a stable good company to work for that offer great benefits. This company is about great team work within the company.
good,Workplace was extremely quiet and very uptight. I was a contractor for a government agency.  That was also their style of work office environment.
good,"A typical big bank, with old southern traditions as to who gets promoted and who doesn't.  You have to know how and be willing to ""play the game""."
good,It was difficult working in a call center.  Our schedules would change every few weeks making it hard to balance work/home life.
good,"•	Managed high call volume with tact and professionalism from business clients averaging 800 calls monthly."
good,SunTrust doesn't take care of their top producers.  You need to leave and come back if you want to get any reasonable bump in pay.
good,The job itself is lack luster but the management team does everything they can to try and make the job better. Job is very repetitive.
good,Good company and as the Branch Manager you are primary person in charge of the Branch Staff and the goals.  At lot of growth with the company.
good,had lots of changes several offices locally were sold to another bank lost lots of clients overall enjoyed working there
good,I have life long relationships at SunTrust Bank and I have able to develop my managerial and project management skills.
good,"I enjoyed everyday being able to help my customers with their needs and wants. Knowing that I could make them smile and make there day better made it a great day for me!"
good,The Credit Card call center was organized and needs a lot of work. Being a Teller was a good job and I learned a lot. I would go back to being a Teller.
good,"As a manager, learned how to manage a branch. Training was excellent. However work/life balance was terrible. You branch was always under staffed so therefore you always have to work extra."
good,"Typically my day begins by opening the branch, going over our plans for the day with each other so we know who's doing what, communication.  From there my day consists of calling clients, assisting clients who visit the branch, doing outreach events during the day for the community."
good,"SunTrust is a good place to work. The pay is pretty good, but the schedules are not good because if you are new, you have to work at night and one day of the weekend."
good,"co-workers are great, I learned how to better interact with people. the most enjoyable part about this job is the flexible hours"
good,"SunTrust overall is a good company to work for, they appreciate diversity and growth potential for employees. They continue to strive for client satisfaciton with mortgages."
good,If you like sales then this is the place for you.  At first I enjoyed it but it became evident that this is all they cared about.  No matter how great you are with customers.  Hard to advance if you are not a stellar seller.
good,I learned how to account for real estate sales for a large banking system. How to research real estate matters when an issue would arise when accounting on the sale of property.
good,hardest part about working there was dealing with clients that would call in and be upset and take their frustration out on you.
good,"Everything had to do with sales. No matter how many times they stressed that our job was about our clients. Nothing is ever enough, and if you hit your goals, your goals go up next time. When you hit your goals, they would try to make any excuse to no give you your commission. No advancement opportunity."
good,Large corp environment with alot of history. This works for some and not for others. Lots of policy changes and not as much communication.
good,"Typical day at work will be taking in transactions that can include from simple deposits and withdrawals to more complex transactions such as savings bonds, foreign currency and foreign drafts. I enjoy conversing with the clients and offer them products that will help fit their banking needs. I enjoy working with my coworkers we make a great team."
good,"I appreciated the opportunity I got working with this company but I did not approve of alot of decisions upper management was taking specially when our department closed down because of the bad decisions being made, also there was alot of favoritism amongst employers from certain managers."
good,"Administrative Activities"
good,This was a great place to start my banking career. The pay was very low but the atmosphere was nice.
good,Every day was a learning experience with SunTrust. The coworkers were friendly and very helpful. Each day you worked from a weekly pipeline to  perform quality validation on the loans processed by the claims team. The hardest part about the job was not knowing if and when the assignment would end. The most enjoyable part of the job was the endless opportunities for growth within the company.
good,"Frontline operations of a bank. Worked at a kiosk in Kroger.Opened checking, savings and money  market accounts. Processed loan applications, assisted customers in balancing their checkbooks"
good,Great company to work for that is big on diversity and on volunteering to give back to the community. Support to help employees in achieving career goals and financial well-being.
good,Being someone who has experience working in a credit union the transition to a bank is a big one. They are more goal/ referral centered. Not every client is in need of the products offered. The work environment is intense and somewhat stressful. Very busy branch with very entitled clients.
good,"it fun to work with my co-worker."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new processes throughout the year, never bored."
good,The best part is knowing that you have helped someone light the way to financial well being.  Knowing that you have helped the client save money with consolidating or saving on interest they are paying or even putting more time back into their personal lifes.
good,a fast paced work environment with room for advancement and great fellow employees
good,"Corporate side is ideal, Retail not so much. Goals are constantly increasing and so is turnover."
good,My favorite part of my job is helping people to meet their financial goals. It is my job to provide excellent customer service and to deepen relationships with my customers through additional sales.
good,busy day emphasis on meeting daily sales referrals and goals. Good coaching and training.
good,"The workplace required was challenging in that managers were required to sell often taking sales from their teammates. Position lacked focus on any one, two or threes things."
good,reviewed mortgage files to determine all documents were received and completed for transfer of services
good,For the most part laid back office and training provided. A lot of workload. Hardest part of the job is to meet the quota.
good,Great way to assist clients with developing a financial plan and sticking with it.  Ability to assist subordinates to learn and grow to move into advanced roles.
good,A typical day at work was reviewing loss statements and reconciling figures against supporting documents. Working closely with internal partners to ensure that work was being completed accurately. Keeping an open line of communication with external customers so that they can provided all needed documents at initial request to ensure a timely submission of funds to them.
good,Utilize resources to conduct consultative conversations and provide financial solutions that meet clients’ needs across all product and service lines. Identify and make appropriate referrals to other lines of business. Promote SunTrust products and services through public address announcements on the host store's public address system as well as prospecting for new client relationships throughout the host store.
good,"I was a cashier at Arby's. I enjoyed working with my co workers there, The customers were mixed reviews."
good,can make a lot of improvements but overall had a decent experience
good,"learned lots on their systems. 9 to 5 not ok for overtime. many meetings via phone and in person. co-workers very competitive, not very helpful if you're not demanding. updating the systems in a blink of an eye for cooperate was hard in a quick matter of time. most enjoyable was getting the clients loans closed up."
good,It is a good stepping stone job. You will learn a lot. Passion for investments is required for you to get anything out of the position. Nobody watches over you and it's expected your work be complete by deadlines.
good,"40 hour work days"
good,"Some good and bad coworkers."
good,"Missed corporate identity  when tried to adopt new ""successful"" business models ."
good,Employees were nice and laid back. Productivity may need improving.
good,The company is great. I just had a bad experience with my branch manager.
good,"Grab some experience and leave within a year or two if you are just starting off."
good,"They are a good company to work for.  It was a temporary position for me, and I enjoyed the people and the work for the time that I was there."
good,please see below.  I worked there for over six years and was recently laid off.
good,very sales and metric driven. micromanaged with not enough direct manager contact.
good,Very fun place to come and work. Learned a lot about the banking business. Management is very pleasant to work with. Co-workers respect each other. The hardest part of the job is when you are not able to find a location and number to another bank branch. Had fun laughing with my co-workers.
good,"If you like working with money and people, this job will work for you"
good,Not much growth potential outside of Atlanta.  Starting salary is decent.
good,"	Pulling GL reports, Teller over and short reports."
good,"In my 38yr of service, it was an interesting job, calculating /handling billing, customer service, utilize automate system to process EDI transactions, provide coverage for staff shortages & vacations"
good,"Its was a great place to work, I always enjoyed working was given the opportunity at another financial institution."
good,Learned lot of information regarding Banking and was a good working enviroment.
good,"It was my first job out of college, i enjoyed it. Fun and an okay place to work."
good,"Typical job, enjoyed my co workers and it was an okay place to work"
good,Great Opportunity for advancement. Enjoyable work environment.
good,"Calling customers who are behind on their mortgage."
good,Work has already been assigned so you know your daily tasks.  I learn about new processes and procedures daily. The coworkers all seem to get along and work together well as a team.  The hardest part of the job is getting recognized as managers have their favorites.  The most enjoyable part is going off site at time for team events.
good,Decent to work for. The end of the month sales goals could become a bit too intense.
good,Great company to get your foot in the door in the financial industry.
good,"Maybe it's my direct management or maybe my branch. But this is the most boring unproductive job I have ever had. If you aspire to trudge your way through corporate life and slowly work your way up, then come aboard."
good,A typical day at work included getting as many assignments generated as possible; with the minimal amount of errors.
good,I work 18 hours a week covering peak times during teller lunch breaks.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with our branch clients.
good,"A typical day at work involves answering back to back calls concerning personal and business credit cards. I have learned what a balance transfer is and how to process one I have also learned how to control my emotions when I’m bothered. The management can be absent at times and un-aware of some company policies. My co-workers are really easy to get along with, quick to help when assistance is needed and knowledgeable of daily work procedures. The hardest part of my job is remaining calm when customers are upset and extremely verbally abusive. The most enjoyable part of my job is solving a customer's issue, making sure all their needs are met and having them express how much they appreciate the good customer service."
good,"I was able to have many opportunities while working under K. Hunter.  She really provided me with a good solid base to learn from the bottom up.  I ended up doing dealer participation, understanding how the dealerships would make a profit off the millions of contracts that SunTrust processed over those years.  I also did all of the auto leasing through SunTrust while they handled this portion of business from the dealers from start to a lease turn in and what responsibilities or avenues that the client could take."
good,"During a normal day I would open  Accounts such as checking, savings, money markets, CD's, etc. As a FSR (Financial Service representative) I was not required to do cashier work. I personally requested to be cross trained to broaden my working field within the bank and was then able to participate as a cashier as well."
good,Typical branch banking experience.  Sizable pressure to meet sales goals.
good,"Al great place to work. Great people, great hours, stressful job."
good,The company has a new management team designed to make the company more competitive and profitable.
good,not the best company did not feel the company put a lot for the employees
good,Work is very demanding but it is rewarding - just not financially.  Pay scale is low.
good,The people at SunTrust work hard and believe their roles play an important part in the success of the company.
good,"Very busy, sales environment. The most enjoyable part of my job is servicing the customers."
good,Typical day is work work work . This is a fast paced environment. Full deadlines and Communication is a must
good,"Currently the company is undergoing many changes. They are still in the process of determining if they want to keep their ""small bank"" great customer service or transition to retail banking sales strategies. There is a lot of employee turn over. More than half of the staff at my banking center left while I was employed there."
good,A typical day at work was 8am to 5pm. Within that time I did daily reports for upper management and initial and final reviews for the underwriters. I learned a lot about what it takes to underwrite a loan and  the mortgage process from start to finish.  Management was great. No micro managing at all and management was good about giving you the opportunity to succeed. Great co-workers I got along with everyone I worked with. In my eyes it wasn't really no hard part to my job. I did my job efficiently everyday with no problems at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was the individuals I worked with and the fun Fridays.
good,"After successful graduation from SunTrust University, I worked at a SunTrust location inside of Publix Supermarket.  As a Financial Services Representative, I was both teller and customer service. From there, I advanced to a retail banking center, operating as a Monday Friday Teller, and a Tuesday Wednesday Thursday customer service representative.  I managed the Safe Deposit box entry.  I had the opportunity to close loans within the branch and discovered an area of banking I considered my niche."
good,"Received large shipment of money throughout the day verify and bundle."
good,"Maintaining cash draw, buying/selling money, handling customers transactions."
good,Management in a Loan approval center for Small Business and Commercial loans.
good,"Currently underwrites conventional purchase and refinance transactions according to SunTrust guidelines. Underwriting review includes use of Automated Underwriting Systems (AUS) such as Desktop Underwriter (DU) and Loan Prospector (LP). Review includes checking for accuracy, fraud, and regulatory compliance. Examines risk elements as related to all loan documents including credit, employment, income, assets, collateral, and occupancy."
good,"A typical day includes opening accounts for clients, making phone calls to existing clients to make them aware of certain promtions, training platform and teller staff and in store aisle prospecting as well"
good,"SunTrust is just like any other bank - goals, policies, rules and deadlines."
good,Fun job helping customers find the right banking products to best suit their needs.
good,A typical day at work is to monitor client's account for adequate coverage.  I provide support to other teammates.  I keep abreast of changes of various regulations we must adhere.  Periodically check to see if we are in compliance.  I have learned sharing knowledge and  maintaining an open line of communication makes an excellence combination.  My co-workers are a delight to work with and a cohesive unit.  The hardest part of job would be forecasting the client's activity to maintain adequate coverage.  The most enjoyable part of job is providing the client with a satisfying resolution and gaining their trust in me to provide them with quality service beyond expectation.
good,Client focused.  Extremely competitive marketplace that leads to long hours to meet or exceed our client's expectations. 
good,"A typical day at work is can be very busy. I have to make travel reservations for the Media and Communications team, process expenses reports within a 60 day time limit, answer phone calls and take messages, transfer callers,reconcile corporate card statements for 6 managing directors, fulfill all request for a team of 20 office staff, greet visitors, office supply ordering, maintaining operation of copy machines and computers by making request through support desk, onboarding of new employees, event planning of company conferences, parties."
good,"A typical day of work consists of three overall duties that repeat themselves on a daily basis: run transactions from the teller line, help clients with service issues & refer SunTrust products & services as solutions for the client.  In addition to procedural knowledge, working at SunTrust has also taught me intangibles such as being an effective leader for new teammates, finding multiple solutions to an issue & being able to comfortably converse about difficult financial situations.  While my teammates & management have been helpful, due to turnover & other factors, it has been difficult to call my experience with SunTrust 'positive' in describing working with my peers.  That has been the hardest part of the job to me: dealing with the constant change of employees & company standards for performance.  However, what has been the most enjoyable part of the job is when I'm able to effectively help a client."
good,"Great training program, but the work was very monotonous. I enjoyed learning about commercial banking, but wanted more autonomy."
good,"SunTrust has great people. The financial industry is going through some major changes, and the company is making the necessary moves to keep up. "
good,"Lots and lots of change going on.  If you make it through with a job, you should be good."
good,Great co worker. Mgr are ok. Morale could be a lot better if Mgr put more effort into it.
good,"- Handled Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and VA Loans to insure requirements met by the guidelines of the investors. Maintained and compiled information for the underwriters and locking in the interest rates."
good,"Typical day would be signing in patients, answering the phone, signing out patients and making confirmation phone calls at the end of the day. I learned how to use the system to sign patients in and out. Management was nice. My coworkers were helpful. The hardest part of the job was resolving patient questions when it was about things I did not know. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,"A Typical day began by assessing my workload and determining if anyone on my team was out so that I could assist with the more urgent matters. I learned team work means much more than pulling your own wait. Often times team members would require assistance with tasks. My co-workers would not hesitate to answer questions and lend a helping hand to others if needed, as would I. The hardest part of the job is not having the ability to help everyone in need. Delivering verbal denials and explanations to clients. The most enjoyable part of the job was team comradery and feeling as though my contribution made a difference."
good,Nice Place to work. There are a few things that needs to be fixed to be a more relaxing place to work. Needs better training.
good,Not too bad a place to work was fun work mates were easy to get along with
good,"Branch manager excellent very efficient,personable and organized...as for co-workers very consumed by outside/home issues that interferred with establishement running smoothly"
good,"Company was great, until new management started to take over. Mentality became like Wells Fargo."
good,Great company to work for with numerous job growth opportunities. Too focused on sales more about selling loans than matching the right products to the right customer.
good,"It is an interesting job that has taught me the financial side to life and business. It has its ups and down, but is something to experience at least once."
good,- assist customers
good,Great opportunity to expand customer service and banking skills. In a years time able to learn all aspects of sales and service/operations of bank. Long hours on some days but great training and opportunities should you devote your time long enough.
good,"I thought I was training to be a teller. And although I did complete teller training and work as such, there was extreme pressure to sell to every customer. (i.e. CD's, Money Market Accounts, etc.)"
good,"Great Place to work and to grow. this is the company, I have grown in my career, and mature. Great company, there is always ups and downs like other companies. I just want to take different challenge."
good,"A typical work day consisted of needing to process as many cases as assigned, this role allowed me to stretch in my problem solving skills with information obtained through interviews and documents provided by clients and merchants. the management style was pretty relaxed, I worked with a great group of teammates we got along very well considering all the different personalities. The hardest part of the job was balancing the regulation we were supporting that benefited the client but also trying to save bank money as well. I enjoyed helping clients whose claims were credit worthy, saving the bank money and collaborating with teammates daily."
good,"The Customer Service aspect of the position I enjoyed because I was helping clients sort out problems with accounts, helping them with financial needs."
good,good place to work to get mortgage experience. has alot of employment opportunities for young
good,Typical banking job for a good bank. Coworkers were generally nice. Helping customers was most enjoyable part of job. Easy job to lose.
good,I did work at this company long so i dont know wat their benefits was about I was only there for a short period of time.
good,Teamwork environment. Not much career advancement. Standard work hours M-F 8am-5pm. Co-Workers are friendly as well as team players.
good,constant training is provided to help advance your career.
good,Too large of a company for me. It was hard to accomplish deliverables due to the red tape and bureaucracy.
good,Out of most corporate companies i'd say Suntrust was the least stressful!
good,Typical day at work included but not limited to:
good,"SunTrust Bank provided me with a crash course in banking. In the over 2 years with the company, I have learned how banking works, how to sell banking products, how to sell non-FDIC insured products, and how to develop great relationships with my clients. SunTrust, as with many banks, is facing difficult times in the economy and has migrated to an aggressive sales purpose for the entire company. The management has encouraged employees to ""sell everything a client needs and nothing they do not,"" but does not back up that philosophy with proper sales reporting and client interaction strategy. SunTrust is transitioning to the same aggressive, under trained sales force that many other large financial institutions have adopted over the past few years."
good,"The Job paid the bills. I for one am seeking to broaden my horizons, while being focused on successfully doing so."
good,"This organization provides a great opportunity for growth and development if you express your desire for it. The benefits are excellent. Recently, the organization began downsizing and has made errors towards their consumers and their bank accounts. This has caused their reputation and trust to decline."
good,"Various work in the tape library includes tape rotation, sending backup tapes off site, moniter system"
good,A call center environment where you take client calls daily to perform account maintance. I learned more about customer service than just being a polite or a kind voice on the line. The client has to be able to feel your concern for them. My management was great even the coaching sessions. I enjoyed helping my clients when they called in daily.
good,"Good enviroment, Teaches alot about banking information. Very busy and goal- oriented atmosphere."
good,High - Volume - fast paced recruiting. Professional and approachable co-workers.
good,"Very hard to get anywhere with this company. Depending on where you're place is how the management will be, every branch is different in how they operate, but this makes it hard to know if you're doing things the right way"
good,I have been with the company for over 29 years and have a wide range of knowledge and experience. In my current position I spend the majority of my day on conference calls related to upcoming projects and little time to execute them. The hardest part of my job is having enough time in the day to complete all that is expected.
good,"Is a an overall good company to work for, but the management needs to step it up."
good,"Micromanaged sales driven, however fair."
good,* Monitoring account balances and processing transactions daily
good,. Most enjoyable part of my job is to be there for my teammates in tough interactions with clients and be able to role model and execute on what I have coached them on .
good,"Accurately and efficiently processing routine transactions for bank customers including cashing checks, accepting deposits and withdrawals, processing loan payments and money transfers. Promote and advise on the bank's products and services as well as uncovering referral opportunities. Performed ATM procedures adding funds and settling. Trained on areas of shipping currency out and documenting the transaction, to open and close accounts (CD, DDA‘s, savings, etc). Delivered grade document customer service"
good,"Great experience dealing with customer and cross line sales , but salary wasn't good."
good,"OK for those on the inside track. Training was available, but a lot of policy & management changes made it hard to focus on a set goal."
good,The company as a whole was great. The department I worked in was diffcult due to the team leads; the manager were great the support was not available when needed you were made by team leads to refer to training materials while you were assisting customers on the phone which increased call volumes and wait times. I enjoyed the work schedule there was no overtime.
good,"A typical day is filled with client servicing, meeting new people, helping client's plan for the future, always helping my team out with anything needed. The most enjoyable part of my day is the smile I get from the client's I help."
good,Good place to work with a lot to be learned. Most people are friendly and happy.
good,"Supervise 3-5 associates, coaching and development of teammates."
good,Great place to learn. If you can develop and get out of the retain side of things the future can be bright. Retail is a large silo and most people can find their way out.
good,opening up the branch and securing the branch and I learned the debits and credits of the banking world. I had a lot of laughs with co-workers and had a lot when the branch was not busy. No hard parts really it was pretty simple and really easy to learn
good,Suntrust Bank is a great employer. Team mates are very friendly and helpful.
good,"Working for RH in 1997 was FUN. Loved the job. SunTrust bought in 2001, kept us from being closed by Citi. SunTrust does not understand the business and thinks they can treat like a bank branch. Now they are getting their wish, and RH will pay for it."
good,"Very process and procedure oriented. Priorities of department are driven by Audit and Federal Regulations. Very detail focused, manual process and procedure, controlled environment. Not a creative or inspiring place to work."
good,During my time here I have grown and learned a lot of roles and job over the years being here.  I have grown as a better leader and manager. I enjoy my work family and how the culture of SunTrust has helped families.
good,leadership is not organized.  the place isn't a good place to grow unless you are cool with certain people.  didn't really feel this was a place to stay.  but it pays the bills
good,"SunTrust is a good place to work. There is an opportunity for growth if you desire to grow in your career. The work and life balance are okay. There are moments when you can feel a little some anxiety, but that is pretty much with any job."
good,"Great talent; strong workplace culture; solid work environment that has done a great job of developing/ advancing internal talent in the past; collaborative environment that can, at times, result in slow decision making"
good,Overall Suntrust wasn’t terrible. The managers & co workers were great.but the job itself isn’t worth the mental stress you go under. After you have been there for some time it seems as if the newer workers are valued more than tenured.
good,This company was going down a road I no longer wanted to go.  While there is was a fun and great place to work.  But when management changed it was micro managed and that was not good.
good,"They make decisions across the board without fully understanding how each branch functions at its best. Like in every organization, some managers are better than others. Unfortunately, the selfish ones that are only looking forward to helping themselves only, are the ones that advance every year or so. I truly believe they need to look at the whole picture and long term results by truly focusing on the customer and employee. Instead it is just rhetoric and churn and burn..."
good,Charge a lot of fees and not very convenient. it can be difficult to achieve sales goes because most of the clients are older less tech savvy people. not many new clients come to the bank.
good,"The objective of this project was to maintain & enhancement of a few databases for the Credit card and Merchant Resolutions department. Work on various possible performance-related issues including Database Tuning with the sole intention of achieving faster response times and better throughput. The enhancement was planned by importing a few tables from different databases (Finance & Sales), modifying the existing table structure, creating necessary views and temporary tables and loading data in this database"
good,SunTrust was not a very good work environment.  There were so many issues and didn't seem like the upper management was in touch enough to try to fix it.
good,"Overall the company is an average place to work.  Not a company that employees tend to stay at.  It is a bank, and they are no different than any other bank.  Cut throat sales goals and lots of micromanagement."
good,"SunTrust is a good company to kick-start your career. Like any company, the people that you work with will be the difference maker. But other than that, it's a good company with room for advancement."
good,"It is a retail job. It's very competitive and Corporate is famous for switching things around last minute. I enjoy my location, and teammates, but some SunTrust policies make it difficult to accomplish goals set forth."
good,"The company has a well-defined mission and 'purpose'.  Employees are also incented to perform.  These two points often work against one another. "
good,"I loved working at SunTrust, until new management came in and did not have the same ethics/morals as I do.  Up until that time, I was proud to work at SunTrust.  Great managers, great benefits, great pay, loved the folks I was working with.  Upper management was good."
good,Good company with nominal growth opportunities. Culture depends on the groups.  Takes a while to adapt due to people working remote. Conservative company and slow or careful to implement new ideas
good,"Suntrust has provided tools and resources for me to educate myself, but the bank  has not provided many opportunities to advance in your career. Fun place to work but not a good place to grow."
good,Great Banking experience. You learned a bunch when it came to all sides of banking. The management in the branches were dedicated and delivered on great customer service. I was responsible at times for as many as 7 branches.
good,Suntrust should allow teammates to work from home without restraints. This job is highly stressful an requires a lot of overtime. Working from home will cut down on the stress and allow you to spend more time at home.
good,"SunTrust is a great company to work for.  Overall good leadership.  I've probably outgrown my pot in my current domain and working for a manager that does not have an adequate mastery of the domain that I am in.  As a result, I'm taking a pause to see about new opportunities for career pathing inside and outside."
good,There are many people that work here that have been around for decades because they love it here. I thought the culture was pretty good and enjoyed working here. Most of my managers were sincere and supportive.
good,"allows you to complete your daily duties without feeling overwhelmed or time restraint. no micromanagement involved, but managers are there when needed be."
good,I loved this job till I got laid off. It had great management that gave the employees a lot of responsibility through self-reliance. The compensation was great.
good,Great team oriented environment with many supportive managers. Great core values. Excellent benefits. Opportunities for growth in areas of process organization.
good,At my time there we had numerous position turnovers. The company was growing but the management became older and they were retiring which was hard for continuity.
good,Good company but management is not the best.  Human Resources always sides with management leaving you with no other options but to go outside of the company for resolutions.
good,Nice people are all around the offices.  Turnover seems a little high and that should be a concern.  I have no real complaints about this company or the job I had.
good,good place to work but again the management isn't always great. the call center and branch were not always on the same page which can be very frustrating
good,SunTrust has several opportunities and channels for career advancement. I was a contractor and I am currently seeking full time opportunities. I would love to continue a career with SunTrust.
good,A typical day at work is busy and very productive.  I  get a lot  accomplished by the end of the day.  My manager is easy going and hard working.  The hardest part of the job is working on time restrictions.  The most enjoyable part of the day is taking a little time to engage with teammates.
good,"You only worked 40 hours a week, but this was a very fast paced/stressful environment.  You were to take as many calls as possible, limited break times and limited talk time with customers.  Sometimes it was hard to help customers because you were concerned with talk times. This was during the Crestar/Suntrust conversion."
good,"Overall it was a decent place. They compensate you well in some areas and in a lot of areas you can have a work balance. The corporate culture is something you'll love and stay for years or hate and leave with less than two. "
good,"My day consist of being on the phone and assisting bankrupt customers with their questions and concerns. I did phone pays, repossessions, settlements, short sells, and monthly extensions on a daily basis.Handled team lead duties. Assist my team with questions and escalated calls. Participated in weekly meetings to discuss upcoming changes and best practices was responsible for working daily and weekly and monthly reports so the department and bank could stay incompliance. Worked bankruptcy mortgages and consumer loans and updated procedures to have the department stay in compliance."
good,"decent place to work, unreasonable goals for some branches, great AM but lack of touch with upper management in most cases. Non Existent pay increases for promotion or yearly, capped at a maximum of 4%. 60 hour work weeks if you are salaried, an a lot of travel. Routine conference and pull up calls, practically daily."
good,"There are those that are able to survive the culture and there are those who are not able.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to survive because I did not know how to communicate very well and was not apart of the click.  I had an emergency once and my manager did not handle it very well.  She gave me the rules on what is considered an emergency and I watched the treatment of an employee who had just lost her mother and it was not pretty.  People are human and I think they have compassion for some and some they make it very difficult."
good,"Managed a team of 3 or more teammates; edited and maintained branch schedule, assisted Branch Manager with teammate reviews and hiring. "
good,"I was hired went to training and came back and had no manager.  I did not feel that the training was adequate and I have not had a steady manager in the year I have been there.  Love the job, and coworkers just need a stable manager."
good,"I started a 6 month contract at SunTrust, that turned into a 10 month contract. I deployed network designs for countless banks, mortgage offices, private wealth management offices, and even worked on the deployment of the new SunTrust Baseball Park in Atlanta. I enjoyed working at SunTrust. I performed so well, that I began to receive additional responsibilities. I was trained for CheckPoint Firewalls, worked to develop VPN tunnels to connect recent acquisitions to join the SunTrust WAN MPLS network. At one point, 3 engineers were trained to produce Wi-Fi AP Placement Proposals, however ultimately, I became the ""one-stop-shop"" responsible for all Wi-Fi designs. It's very time consuming work, but rewarding."
good,"You must be able to adapt to a culture with a different mindset. Not as much accountability by senior leaders as I would have expected. Advancement is based on personal relationships, not merit."
good,"SunTrust has a very heavy middle management and ""everyone must agree"" culture.  This bottlenecks all decisions, and not much can get accomplished in a efficient manner in such an environment.  Also, it lends itself to micro management by middle managers over their first line managers and employees.  I like to work efficiently and make things happen.  In such a culture, this can be very frustrating."
good,"Job security is present."
good,Fast paced environment. Good coworkers. Doesn't always appear that management has the best interest for employees at heart. Employee moral has begin to strengthen over the last few months.
good,"Motivates to learn and learn new skills "
good,"Traditional conservative bank. Compensation is ok, not great. The retail investment channel has a culture of sell first,  ot necessarily putting clients interests first."
good,"The manager at the branch that I worked in was a complete racist."
good,"I came to SunTrust looking for a change.. "
good,Always room for advancement. Flexible hours and pay. Excellent benefits and extensive training. Fun environment and great team members to work with
good,"Great place to work in team environment to meet growing needs of a bank moving into the national spotlight.  Work included meeting with several lines of business in the asset finance brokerage unit, building new software solutions and eliminating redundant capture of data.  Systems included Misys LOAN IQ, AFS COMPASS, Bloomberg, DTCC, Calypso Derivatives system, Impact brokerage system, MTS Money Transfer system, OnLine Treasury Manager and GEAC General Ledger systems.    Regulatory reporting included Dodd Frank Volcker, CCAR Liquidity reporting, Shared National Credit reporting and other ad hoc internal audit requests."
good,I help open each vault and the night drop once we first arrive into the building. Then I go to the computer that I am going to be on for the day and sign on. Once we open at 9am I start with calling clients in my referral cue. I talk to clients and see what accounts best fit each client.
good,"Corporate Culture is as you'd expect it to be. They're making an effort to improve employee financial well-being, though"
good,"Grow or Go was the name of the game."
good,"During the daily activities at SunTrust Bank its vital to continue to build rapor with clients through name recognition and a expressing genuine support in helping with their financial plans.This is done in the teller line, during outbound calls, and face to face. Clients are true loyal and feel supported in business relationship when you listen and provide various solutions to the situations they have."
good,A good company to work for if you are looking to advance. They do like to promote from within. I enjoy my co workers and the clients that I interact with from a day to day basis. SunTrust has a very extensive training program that aids in your development with the company.
good,"A typical day at work for a teller at SunTrust, is following bank procedures, providing excellent service for clients, and meeting goal requirements. Since I've been with the company, I've enhanced my balancing abilities, referral goals, product knowledge, teller coordinate role, and being more efficient with multitasking while keeping mistakes to a minimum. Since I've been at SunTrust I've had three managers. With the Middle Georgia area, there has been a lot of turnover. I believe in working as ""One Team"". My teller coordinator and I have established a strong sense of how we communicate, lend and helping hand when one needs to finish a task and help each other with referral goals. With it only being two tellers at my current branch it makes it difficult to get every client in and out in a timely manner. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job is building a connection with out clients and really helping impact their lives."
good,"I started at the ""bottom"" of the food chain.  And during my career enjoyed many diverse jobs and learned a great deal.  My last position with this company was V.P. of Quality.  "
good,"This company does great with training...the expectations may be a little far fetched as far as client referrals go. "
good,Call center environment departments  are interlinked must have strong sales experience. Must adapt to frequent changes for  business needs. Very good intensive training for products and services
good,"Accuracy on cash drawer, providing excellent customer service, taking care of expressed customer needs, uncovering customer needs by asking a variety of questions, marketing and collections."
good,Professional environment.  Better management skills. Great employees and work was very confusing at times due to management and employee being on the wrong page
good,Fun and learn a great deal! The hours are great and benefits are very good. Great Teammmates to work with and clients are so nice
good,ill satisfied in this company because they gave to us the right benefits and they are good employer . that's why we also gave the better  and good job.
good,"Good atmosphere, very hard to advance and job security is uncertain with centers going to foreign countries."
good,My tipical day at work setting personal goals. Always open to learning new things. Consistant with informing management of my needs in compliance and  strive beyond our company's goals. In our department teamwork would make the dream work and the hardest was never seeing our department meet our company's goals. The most enjoyable part of my job would be keeping our company's goal in providing excellent custormer service and curing loans.
good,"- open/close accounts, loan applications, fulfill customer requests"
good,Sending closing packages out in timely matter. Great co-works. Worked well as a team. The hardest part on this job was there was no closing calendar for out clients every closing was requested manually. The most enjoyable part of this job were the people. Great team and all worked well together
good,Overall a good experience.. It was a fun place to work. My co workers were awesome!
good,a typical banking job working with others no job security can be laid off within a couple months of being hired
good,"I was offered a permanent position at Sun Trust, which turned into a contract position after to three week delay for a start date.  The position ended abruptly with lack of funding for the reason for ending my contract."
good,The environment is very stressful and I do not like working in a place where there is so much micromanaging. This job gave me more experience in what I know how to do and learned somewhat of different aspects of this field. The co-workers were very nice and easy to get along wth.
good,"Working at SunTrust taught me how corporate America works.  I met lifetime friends while employed there.  After learning my job duties, my position became kind of boring. I found it difficult to advance to other areas of the company."
good,"As a Bm I work about 40-58 hours a week. This year my center that was impacted by Role Clarity, which made some changes my staff and as a result of downsizing, I am required to do the role as operations for the center as well. As a team every day we start with a recap of the prior days performance, We talk about how we could have change or improved the results and focus on the key behaviors which requires us to achieve our daily commitments. Also have our mid day touch points and end of day check out. My staff is a total of 6 teammates. 2 tellers, 2 personal bankers, 1 CSS, 1 TC. Working with the partner daily require us as a team to understand each of our goals and how it impacts the business. The hardest part of my role is making sure we have the right people in the right role and making sure they understand the import ants of the their role. Also having the support from the AM when it's time to make changes. What I enjoy most of all is help fellow teammates be successful, taking a teammate that has passion, drive and trust in what we do everyday impact so many of our client financial future. I also enjoy the fact that I can impact clients lives in so many way now and in the future. As a manager our goals are to hit our commitments while building and Deeping our clients relationships. Reason I have done banking for so many years is because I  enjoy helping my clients and it gives me purpose to do more."
good,Great group of people to work with in a team aspect. Call center very busy needs to upgrade technology less paperwork.
good,"Good company to work for. Typically you mainly communicate through email, must be able to work in a fast paced environment and to multitask many required duties and have good time management skills."
good,SunTrust bank gave me an opportunity to gain experience in the banking industry.  It's a good place to work.
good,"Being in an in-store branch it was a very busy and fast paced branch, but our clients made it easy, a lot of people don't realize that they don't only become your clients but also your friends they rely on you as their personal baner. I love working face to face with people.  We had a lot of european clients. Working in an in-store branch we have to do teller work as well as opening accounts and doing personal loans, credit cards applications and referral, we had to have a consultative conversation with our clients to uncover their needs, and try to place them in the correct products that will suit their banking or lending needs. I am a team player I love to help my co-workers,  that will lead me to learn more and they learn from me as well. The two hardest part of my job was being away for so many hours and not being able to see my children, the second hardest part of my job when Suntrust Bank close the in-store branches. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers and the clients, there is so much you could learn from them, just paying attention to what they say every detail and then being able to help them."
good,ST is coming into the 21st century. Plans for the future in security is very bright.
good,"It's hard to obtain career growth at SunTrust. The work environment however, is nice and company benefits are standard in comparison to other corporations."
good,"A typical work day is managed to day to day calendar, appointments and meetings for the Vice President.  Scheduled meetings, time keeping and respond to email and phone inquiries."
good,within both employers great experiences were shared. Valued experiences and trainings taken to promote a better employee and work place assessed.
good,"during my stay in suntrust, my everyday concern was to fix all those computer concerns also with their internet connection. I pull out equipment and I distribute new Computer deliveries. and also I handled their computer accountability."
good,"Very conservative company. Had a lot of opportunity to learn. However, new company initiative to cut cost resulted in the loss of good talent. Co-workers are the nicest people to work with."
good,"I enjoyed the clients the most. I had a wonderful client base. If this job wasn't so micro-managed in how you speak to your client, it would be a busier and more enjoyable place to work. With that said, I really enjoyed my co-workers and clients, it felt like a family."
good,A typical day at work involves cash handling and customer service.
good,"The job can be extremely mentally stressful at times. There are areas that are very micromanaged, and there are some areas that are very relaxed. The busier the department the less micromanagement. The higher the call volume=less micromanagement. Less calls=more micromanagement. Offers remote work opportunities."
good,"I typical day at work involves delegating cases to teammates.  Then working as a team to clear cases.  The hardest part of the job the cases load is very heavy, but we work as team to clear them."
good,"I enjoyed the time hired at SunTrust. I always went above and beyond to represent the company to its fullest however based on the atmosphere in most cases it is difficult advancing, however I remained loyal to the company that hired me I will always recommend this opportunity to anyone looking for growth."
good,"You may have leader that you would follow to the ends of the earth or you may have manager that wants to track every second, of every minute, of every day."
good,"I loved working at Suntrust Bank. Unfortunately, I was placed in a situation where I had to make a personal decision knowing that I would leave the job. Management makes the atmosphere easy to work with."
good,The job is overall good. Just could use more mature productive employees. I have learned a great deal of knowledge working for this company and they provide great benefits.
good,"Its a good place to learn about the Banking industry and co-workers were really cool. I find that I need a less stressful department to work in, though."
good,"I loved working there at first, but very quickly it turned into a sales job. We were required to sell a certain number of ""products"" per month, or we were disciplined."
good,"Suntrust has great benefits. I don't believe they pay enough, if your branch is open on the weekends and you're short staffed they make you work 6 days a week until you're fully staffed. Not enough teller support. Not very flexible with doctors appointments and work life situations."
good,I am a nurse by trade so working in a call center for a bank just wasn't something that I enjoyed on a day to day basis. The benefits and office atmosphere are great but the rude clients make it hard to handle.
good,"The line of business get moved around so much you never know when your role will be under someone else.  "
good,"I enjoyed  my  job  until  the  last  2  years  because  of   all  the  changes.  I  enjoyed   the  clients  and  co-workers..."
good,"Compensation metric bad; loyalty has no precedence, work past performance does not matter, only what sales you produce counts."
good,"definitely should screen managers more that are hired, and rather hire outside rather than inside, great benefits and really flexible with work life balance"
good,"The culture is great. Good work/life balance for a bank. Great opportunities for internal movement, but salary increases are capped at 4.5% (8% in extreme situations) which is much too low, so talent is forced to leave. Great company to work for on the back end of your career when money is not the main priority."
good,The review of my tenure with this company (18 years) have been nothing but positive. SunTrust Mortgage HQ has a wonderful place to work with a great culture of employees.
good,i was head teller had to order money wait on customer balance account over tellers and help them with difference transaction with customers do wire transaction open up different accounts for customers
good,"This was a very stressful job. Everyday was a race to meet our ""numbers"" in regard to daily production, which ultimately was dependent on the volume of customers entering the bank."
good,"Loved working in banking, however, things are so competitive that work practices became unethical. There were times we had to push products on customers that did not benefit them."
good,I enjoyed working for SunTrust Bank. The call center was great for our customers as well as employees if needed. The branch staff always worked as a team to achieve goals.
good,Enjoyable part of the job is the associates you work with.  Hardest part of the job is the banking industry in general and the constant change and regulation.
good,"Fun place to work, you meet different people, watch the games and laugh.  I feel if they raise the pay and give employees benefits, it would be a better place to work."
good,"Working at SunTrust, their is endless opportunity. Connect with people and work hard at what you do and the opportunity for advancement is endless. Work-life balance is one thing that is important in my life. That was the only downside I had."
good,SunTrust Bank is a good place to work.  You always have to be flexible to change and adapt to new ways of doing your daily work. I enjoy teamwork and accountability in whatever you are involved with on the job.  Teaching others and in term learning new tasks keep it interesting.
good,Not many opportunities to advance within the company. Training is not the best and the tools and resources are not among the best in the industry. Regional managers and area managers due care about you but not enough about career development.
good,"SunTrust can be a great place to work - depending on what location you are at. However branch banking is shrinking with all banks, not just SunTrust. More customers are going online to open deposit accounts and loans and forgoing the branch experience. Individual goals at the branches have not adjusted to the loss of online activity and have instead doubled at SunTrust. I love my line of work, helping customers achieve their goals and understanding how the financial system works and SunTrust gives you the tools and training to do that. Just be prepared to sell to every customer."
good,"its a great company to work for as far as benefits go, depending on management you can lean alot. The field is very high sales oriented  and job security is not a comfort one will have."
good,Overall good company to work for. The hours are manageable if fully staffed but that usually is not the case.The people/team there are pleasant to work with.
good,It is a very face paced environment.  You must be good at multi-tasking and being detail-oriented.  The client is in the center of all we do.  There is room for advancement specially since corporate is here in Atlanta.
good,The job can be super stressful as you are dealing with people's money. Teammates and direct management make it a very fun and family oriented environment.
good,"A typical day at SunTrust can go one of two ways depending on where you are working. You can have productive day where the management team communicates well, teammates work together and everyone achieves the goal; Or you have to open the branch by yourself, have the manager be late, be under pressure to meet the  sales goals that keep growing while the opportunities keep decreasing."
good,"A typical workday consists of making calls that will lead to sales or scheduling appointments for financial review, opening accounts, answering phones and questions, preparing calendars for follow ups,working teller window if needed, telephone conferences, uncovering clients needs and goals to better align them with products that fit their lives, live the one team model."
good,This was my first banking job. I did enjoy learning about the banking world but this wasn't the place for me. Upper management was too sales focused and punished you if goals weren't met.
good,They have a lot of really good people who work at Suntrust. I had a great experience and enjoyed gleaning and learning behind some really great leaders.
good,"Good company to work for with starting out. Learned how to manage in a more effective way. My coworkers were great to work for and with, we all had a great time with the company."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is being around my co-workers, I feel that we have created a strong relationship within my group of peers."
good,"Heavy work load, supervisors that do not pull their weight of the work load, no formal training, reorganized the Richmond Ops Office that left hard workers out of work due to forced early retirement, leaving the understaffed remaining employees with additional work to complete, no over time offered."
good,"i enjoyed my stay and learned alot , but i came in at abad time , there was alot of confusion amognts the coworkes , but i would recomend the job"
good,"I enjoyed working with my team mates. The hardest part of my job was making sales for the bank because there were very few locations of Sun Trust. I enjoyed working with customers and especially with money, numbers, and banking. My drawer always came out even so I was very happy with that."
good,"A typical day is the typical day in the life as a teller.  Took care of customers deposits, withdrawals, financial needs and questions.  I learned how to provide excellent customer service with SunTrust.  They even offered training on how to provide wonderful customer service as well as how to put a positive spin on the word NO.  I found that management wasn't very supportive and liked to micromanage everything you did or said.  I enjoyed all of my co-workers outside of management.  We worked well together and cared for each other.  The hardest part of this job was not having much support from management.  We seemed to have negative criticism more than positive.  I did enjoy all the customers and being able to help them financially."
good,"A typical day as a teller at SunTrust is just running basic teller operations, and profiling clients to try and get any and every product you can out of them. The sales goals raised while I was there and are somewhat unrealistic. Not the place to work if you are uncomfortable selling to people and getting coached on doing so. Co-workers are fantastic. The first place I have worked where I loved all of my co-workers. Management is always up for listening to you and does try to help you. The hardest part about the job is sales and the most enjoyable is the co-workers."
good,"So much of a work culture trickles down from the current management. Due to this, the work environment had been both such a wonderful, productive place to be and also such a frustrating, challenging workplace to exist."
good,"Analytical  work environment, good place to obtain experience."
good,"A typical work day consists of relentless back-to-back calls from upset clients, with various issues."
good,My daily duties of my current position include reviewing legal documentation when opening fiduciary accounts to ensure that the documentation complies with state statue. Perform problem resolution via telephone support by diagnosing problems by active listening. Assists branch representatives’ in answering questions regarding bank policies and procedures.
good,The hardest part is not knowing if there is stability with career.
good,"In SunTrust account, I am working on a production support project at Atlanta, US. My role is of ETL lead, I have to interact with Client and business users to solve any issues and getting work done from my onshore and offshore team. Along with this, I do code and documentation review, enhancing code for better performance and fixing the issues if required and doing minor development. We have critical month/quarter/year end process. Below is the brief description about the project."
good,Greet ever client and customer with professionalism. Processed transactions with speed and accuracy. I learned that being nice to everyone does pay off. I wish break times could have been managed better and had more people to get those done. Getting use to all the different clients who met me for the first couple of times. Once I got to know the regular clients I called them by name and that seemed to bring a smile to their faces.
good,Typical corporate work place.  I used my time at SunTrust to build and develop not only my professional life but at the same time I learned a ton about myself.  I enjoyed doing various tasks as opposed to the same thing everyday.  It keeps you on your toes.
good,Management style is wonderful. Pay is fairly low and commission pay scale changed 4 times the short time I was there.
good,"Sales oriented organization, teammates are well trained. Expectations are high but you know what is expected. "
good,"As a loan officer, I would solicit mortgage loans from referral sources. Those sources include, but are not limited to, Realtors, builders and other networking avenues. In this role I would take complete applications for mortgage loans, including follow-up for documentation required for processing in accordance with corporate policies and procedures"
good,I enjoyed assisting customer (coworkers); assisted updating the payroll systems with employee information. Assisting with identifying payroll information and checks.
good,"Would work there again if need be. 30 minute lunches 15 min breaks when possible. Hard to make sales goals when running a teller window as well. Training is great. You will not be thrown to the wolves, you will be prepared for whatever may come your way."
good,"I enjoyed working with the clients and guiding them through the loss mitigation.  I worked with clients that were trying to get loan modifications, short sales, and deed in lieu on their mortgage loans.  Some of them applied several times and were frustrated with the process.  Some clients were had been in loss mitigation for 2-3 years.  The underwriters seemed overwhelmed and stressed out.  I seldom got an answer on the 150+ loans I was assigned.  I usually got about 6-10 a month approved.  We always received information saying the process was streamlined but seldom received approvals.  "
good,"Greeting my co-workers in the morning is very important to me.  I enjoy learning different things and creating ideas on team relations.  Hardest part of a job is making sure a job is done to perfection at a deadline.  The most enjoyable part of a job is management, team, and getting along with clients."
good,A great work environment. Management is concerned with your success and makes sure you have all the tools necessary to complete the job. Close work environment where peers care about and help one another understanding we all succeed as a team. A great place to learn the mortgage industry gaining experience with different investors.
good,STI needs to become One Bank.  Disparate groups throughout the Southeast detract from its power.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know all kinds of individuals.
good,"Enjoyed working, friendly atmosphere, location was great, good place to settle down. "
good,"You get what you signed up for. No bank exists for the benefit of its employees. No sir.. that does not exist. The banks, like all corporations were founded by investors looking to turn a profit. Branch banking is what it is. If you don't like it, do it for a while and get out, because the bank sure is going to work you to squeeze every dime of profit they can out of you. Luckily the managers are human friendly and work with you to the extent possible. If you are a banker. This is not a bad bank to work for. "
good,"• Handled customer complaints with problems such a s: overdrawn accounts, deposits, and withdrawal discrepancies"
good,"Great boss, learned a lot from financial team, always new things to learn and do."
good,"Started working with SunTrust Bank in Aug ‘12 as a Client Service Manager whose major job responsibilities include helping the Banking Manager run a profitable and customer focused Banking Center. My job responsibly included enhances organizational client services by ensuring client inquiries and requests are responded to accurately and in a timely fashion; managing staff.

Also responsible for assisting Branch Manager in leadership of branch, and is part of the branch leadership team. Acts as second in command to Branch Manager. Manages tasks and functions within the branch as delegated by the branch manager. I have been managing branch main vault & ATM etc."
good,"I have been in banking for 13 years. Through those years I have advanced in my career. My work life consists of managing day to day activities in sales, operations and customer service.I am in a result driven environment. On a daily basis, my team and I strive to meet and exceed our goals. We are very successful and we continue to put our clients first. The most enjoyable part of my job is when my team has met and exceeded the goals; All of our hard work has paid off and our clients are happy."
good,SunTrust bank is a great place to work. I enjoy working with my teammates. I enjoy helping my clients manage their accounts and assist them in meeting their financial goals.
good,"Working at SunTrust helped me to really take a look at my finances, and encouraged the need to put an emergency fund in place. The best part of the job was working with people who were passionate about helping others and sharing knowledge about products and services."
good,The company cultivates a familial culture which gives employees a comfortable ambiance. The management itself is diverse and dynamic. One of the challenges faced in this industry is dealing with its customers but employees can eventually learn how to get by.
good,SunTrust provides a diverse workplace environment.  The company provides resources to strengthen and learn new skills.  The pay is great.  The benefits are good.
good,Suntrust is like a long line of Call centers.  Customer hate calling in.  A fanatical dedication to call metrics means that the position of call agent is easily gamed.
good,"•	Consistently provided outstanding customer service and whenever possible promote other bank services & products, and find opportunity for sales referrals"
good,"Usual day at SunTrust as a teller was fast paced on some days and quiet on some. I learned how to be detail oriented, be more patient when faced with a difficult client or situation, become artistic when trying to make sales offer and the learned how to deal with criminals (fraud was rampant so you have to be vigilant)."
good,I would make calls all day when I wasn't working with clients to set up wealth investments appointments with them to try and sell them on various products we had to offer to make their money work for them.  I would also try and convert big deposits into long term investments to keep the money inside of Suntrust and not invest elsewhere.
good,Nice company but difficult growth potential. You can get stuck in the same position with no opportunity to get to the next level in your career. Management dictates your next step despite your successes and achievements.
good,Suntrust was a good company to work for but they didn’t give a lot of hours and the way you were paid I didn’t like so much but besides that the benefits are good it’s a good part time job for someone in college.
good,They are a good company to work for. Providing training for staff. Provided quality service to clients. A fun working environment and could easily build relationships with clients based on products offered and well suited per client needs.
good,Suntrust is a typical bank environment. You open accounts and try to match clients to products. Was it tries to sugar coat is that it's not a sales job. Believe me; it is sales jobs. Your client rating could be at 100 percent. If you don't meet your numbers than you are out. It's that simple.
good,"My typical work day at SunTrust  processing customer's cash transaction, process loan payments. Selling SunTrust, prodOrganized all new hire, security and temporary paperwork."
good,Great company to work for- I had a great manager. Only down fall is the monthly window for reductions so people know this is company. Constant pressure to reduce cost is stressful
good,"SunTrust is constantly realigning.  Tenure means nothing at SunTrust, they are currently replacing the IT staff with visa sponsored talent.  This is very sad seeing that SunTrust's is based out of Atlanta."
good,"A typical day at work at my branch is a busy teller line, a lot walk in traffic so its easy to reach the teller referral goal. The hardest part of the job is being a busy branch while under staff for a while already so it becomes hard to take lunch breaks and to keep up with the customer service clients and company expect; we feel overwork while our remuneration stays the same. Management and upper management has been aware of the issue since it started but haven't solved it yet. (this the reason why my overall rating is only 3 stars) I do enjoy the people who I work with I think they are a great team. On the other hand the company have good benefits."
good,This job was a very fast paced and often hectic job because it was time sensitive. All payments received on that day had to be processed before we could leave. I was a fast accurate keyer so I could set my pace as I felt fit.
good,I wouldn't mind going back to the location and the the business. I learned alot there and had the drive to accomplish alot. The people there was awsome
good,SunTrust was really great with how they treated their employees as far as compensation and benefits. Truthfully I'd have loved to stay with the company but after being moved around a few times I found myself in a position with no advancement. In addition I felt I was overpaid and underworked so I left to feel more productive
good,"Suntrust is overall one of the best companies to work for. There is several room for advancement and growth. Also my workplace culture has been awesome so far. However, some branches are extremely slow and you can make your calls and still not meet your goals. Suntrust should provide a better system for their calls aka ""outbound reaching"" especially for slow traffic branches."
good,"SunTrust has a very customer-centric job focus, like most retail jobs it is fast paced and results driven, but goals are reasonable and achievable.It's definitely a good place to have a foot in the door, they like to try and maintain employees."
good,I started my banking career here. The employees are all helpful. The branch team worked great together. I was provided all the tools I needed to fulfill my job.
good,"I have no comment at this time about the company, good company to work and good management, sad that many departments are closing. No other comment at this time. Thank you"
good,"Sadly, I wasn't there long enough to give a full review. However, my short time there it was a very nice, professional, friendly, work environment."
good,"A typical work day concise of medium call volume, reports due in a timely manner. Corresponding with local attorney's office and management team/co-worker. Drafting motions and monitoring bankruptcy filing and dismissal."
good,"Needs to increase compensation to match cost of living in 2015. Or, continue to experience high turn over rates. Overall, not a happy teammate following all of the year spent with this bank."
good,"A typical day at work would mean lots for reports to create, work and distribute to the team, management, and myself. Researching process related questions from clients sent to me via email from my manager, HPCR representatives, or staff. Assisting my teammates if my work volume is low.  Management is always open to suggestions which is good. I enjoy the classes that we are able to take on Learning Portal. Classes cover almost all lines of business which is great because you can get Free training information."
good,it's a great place to work.  Great career options and the pay is good if you already have banking experience.    The hardest part of my job is the cold calling.    Working there is great until they decide to get rid of your position.  They will discard you very quickly.
good,"Job responsibilities are clearly defined. Competitive benefits package, great corporate atmosphere. Management cares about the professional development of employees.  Engagement is very important to the organization."
good,Member of enterprise-wide performance testing/engineering team charged with delivering testing solutions designed to capture performance profiles of bank's software applications.
good,"SunTrust can be a rewarding place to work. They pay the median when it comes to salaries compared to other organizations. SunTrust does provide decent benefits and does show commitment to its employees. My own gripe about SunTrust, particularly the department that I worked in, is that it was very ""reactionary"" instead of ""proactive"". There were several customer service related issues which escalated due to the Management not truly taking input from the employees. Also, the former manager of the department where I worked, was very superficial, rude and an ego-maniac. If we had better leadership, our department would have had better results. But she was later demoted."
good,"As a part-time employee, I found Suntrust to offer much flexibility regarding my schedule. New jobs seems to always be created as advancement opportunity."
good,I enjoyed everything about this job.  I was new to the banking industry and I learned a great deal while working there.  Customers were wonderful.
good,Management was very nice to work with and alway very helpful.
good,"You are to be at your desk at all times; however, you do get praised for making sales"
good,The culture and track for advancement seems to be improving. Technology and process efficiency needs improvement. Pay is lower than the industry standards. If you want to advance you can do it here.
good,"Processed internal requests from branches, did not have much training but was able to achieve goals."
good,Fast paced branch in the heart of Kannapolis business area. Enjoyed client interaction and had a great supervisor. The hardest part of the job was being in the middle of conflict between employees and management constantly.
good,I enjoyed working at SunTrust; I still miss my customers and sometimes see them when shopping. They all ask when I am coming back!
good,I learned that my communication skills with clients was almost the best in the company and i strove towards excellence on a daily basis> customer satisfaction was my number one goal.
good,The management has a open approach to achieving work performance and productivity by providing the employees an open end work day which has created high productivity results.
good,I loved working at SunTrust. I love to be challenged and busy and being a teller provides that for me. There is something new everyday and I love helping people.
good,"With my first 3 managers I absolutely loved my job and learned a lot. They pushed me to learn new things and new positions. They treated me with respect and often gave me raises for a job well done and meeting and excelling my goals. After my last manager left, the lady I thought that was more experienced and definitely knew the job well didn't get the management position. Thet"
good,They provide amazing benefits & the managers are some of the best I worked for. But the job is extremely stressful. Its a difficult work environment if you have not had any call center experience.
good,"I enjoyed working at SunTrust. I have no complaints about my manager or management in general. I also felt like I was paid fairly for the role I was in. However, I left because I wasn't satisfied making $40K and went to grad school for my MBA. I also had absolutely no interest in being a branch manager and that was the next promotion that would be available for me. It is basically a sales and customer service job and that was just not something I would want to do for the rest of my life."
good,"I don't know what to say. You do your job you are fine.  hardest part of the job is the survey after the file closes.  sometimes the processor is punished for others doing.  i.e. LO, underwriter or closer"
good,"Suntrust is a great place to work recommend for someone just starting. I love handling money, clients, suntrust family but like in every family there is that one that you just I don't know. Because it is a very competitive workplace on referrals and sales but over  all it's a good paying job with good benefits."
good,"working at suntrust, was a very diverse and professional setting. where there was always a new challenge to overcome and to better understand the customer."
good,If you are looking to expand your knowledge in the banking industry its a great way to start your career here because of the several opportunities for advancement. It all depends on how great you deliver and how comfortable you are with the people you work with.
good,Typical day was nice...Had a great team in branch...Customers were great...Worked longer hours than stand alone branches...We were an in-store branch.
good,Hours at the commercial bank are very reasonable. Most people are out by 5pm. Management cares about your development but they may set out a path for you that might not have chosen for yourself. Groups are very friendly. Everyone is out to help each other. Pleasant environment. Pay is adequate but not great.
good,"I worked with fantastic gifted people and great customers and enjoyed working with them.  That was the best part of my job.  Howerver, I'm currently not sure what direction the Bank is going in."
good,not enough opportunity for part time to advance to full time teller
good,"A typical day as a bank teller, I would be processing transcations for clients, whether they're in front of me or sitting with a banker.  I also refer products that would be beneficial for them according to their financial needs. The hardest part of the job can sometimes be referring poducts because some clients don't want to be bothered, or already have majority of the products that we offer."
good,SunTrust is a great place to work and provides many advancement opportunities.  I am fortunate to have started my career here.
good,Typical day involved various duties depending upon the needs of the estate clients or fiduciary compliance matters.
good,"While at Suntrust, my everyday goal was to help as many customers as i could by thr end of my shift."
good,Every day would be an opportunity to meet new people and obtain new clients.  Received exemplary benefits package.  Fast paced environment during certain hours.
good,high speed high stress high quotas manageable pay was good benefits were great management was truly caring about the role you have in the companies future endeavors.
good,Excellent benefits and process flow for every aspect of work stream.  Training and customer service management culture is one of the best . But no opportunity to advance in Central FL area .
good,A typical work day consists of teammate engagement throughout the organization.  The work place culture is centered on knowing your customer internally and externally.  The management style is conducive to satisfying the objectives of the performance and behavior.
good,"You have to act like a robot when working here. You have to use scripting for everything. It is not a personable place where you can be yourself and build real client relationships."
good,An overall great company to work for. SunTrust truly cares about their clients as well as their employees. Your team will have your back at all times.
good,"great business to work for, learned a lot from the banking field. workplace culture was stress free and enjoyable to work for that company."
good,Very slow paced company. Great work/life balance retail side of bank is extremely slow. Management takes fridays off.
good,"deal with a lot clients, and have to move at a quick pace and be accurate with your work and work production. easy to learn the system and move up in the company if that is something you want to do."
good,Providing great customer service for customers and internal departments.  Learned the value of being of providing great service to our customers.  Suntrust rewarded it employees if deparment goals were met.  When providing service to a customer it was somewhat difficult cross selling other products.
good,"A calm enviroment, as a teller I learned a lot however each day was about the same. If you enjoy the same thing daily, the bank is for you!"
good,Great company to work for n regards to work/life balance and with the opportunity of advancement.
good,"I sold personal banking accounts, CDs, investment accounts, and performed customer service"
good,Great place to work they have knowledgeable team of players and administrative employees.
good,Typical work day went pretty smooth and at a good pace. Learned a lot of skills dealing with banking. The work environment was great and the management was great.
good,"This job is not for everyone. You need to be able to meet your goal every month which was easy for me due to my extensive background in sales in my previous jobs. Customer service is very important you represent the company, you are the face of the company which is one of my strongest suit. Just pray to God that you get a good, honest and fair manager."
good,"working for the bank the was a good experince, i learned a lot working with the public and co-workers, but the was a hard work to do when you have a lot responsibility with peoples money."
good,Managers always to help you as well as coworkers. The calls are insanely annoying and rude mostly the Spanish speaker ones. They can call 20 times and always complaint about everything.
good,"great pay and benefits, fun and close team work enviroment,employees are treated well and valuable..but this is very fast paced and sometimes stressful job,must have thick skin when dealing with irrate customers."
good,"Very comfortable place to work, even though we stayed focused on our tasks. Good Team environment with knowledge transfer and assistance from co-workers always available."
good,SunTrust is typical banking. Some days are slow and some days are just fast it all depends. It does require some selling which can become competitive at times.
good,"Friendly and helpful co-workers"
good,"SunTrust holds great potential and my experience there allow me to gain the necessary leadership experience; however, the company lack the ability to sustain their best employees"
good,"A typical day here was just calling clients regarding the delinquency of there loans with the bank. This job was not guaranteed on giving me permanent position, so had to move on."
good,"Not  truly concerned with customer service , only bottom line.  Treats employees as disposible assets. 32 years in the banking  industry with this being the worst."
good,"fun place to work, flexible with schedules, and you get a great discount too."
good,I worked here for 3 years a very long time ago. It was pretty high stress because we handled a lot of money now days you have Brinks so you don't have to handle as much
good,Overall its a nice place to work. The Compensation (goals) change all the time once you master it they change it. I guess the benefits is compatible with most company. There is no job security if your not liked by the manager anything will get rid of you. On the other hand if your are liked by the manager do the same thing and they find you a way out for you. If your under the right manager your able to advance to the next level. The lead Managers need more training on people skills and know how to effectively manager the branches. Life Balance it was all about them and their family. if under the wrong manager they don't give a care about your family. The job was easy the manager made it stressful. The most enjoyable part of the job was my first three years. I was taught so much and having that manager that set that example on how things were supposed to be. When you have a good leader  everybody  win. The whole team was on the Chairman / President Club. Until they training the whole management team on how to treat people and how to manage. They will loose all of the good people they do have. The hardest part of the job was some of the managers action.
good,The position gives you a firm foundation of the banking environment. I would work for the company again. Must have good manager.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing the smile on  the customers face by meeting their needs. It is rewarding to see the customer happy as well as reaching the goals for the company.
good,I only like the fact that the company’s headquarters is located in Atlanta. The opportunity to step into different roles is very high. This company brings a lot of jobs to the city
good,overall its not a bad place to work although it would be nice to have more opportunity for advancement. i feel that the higher positions rarely come available
good,"CONS:"
good,working here for almost 12 years and there was never much room for advancement to increase/improve my knowledge and skills.
good,SunTrust has some great employees and comfortable work place.
good,"Typical situation.  The stock prices and commission payouts are more important."
good,"Constant changes, not a ""true plan"", a high turnover ratio, poor culture...ok benefits. 2 weeks vacation, health insurance, discount products but that was just the call center or the STOLI dpt... can't speak for the other dpts."
good,SunTrust is a great company. Located at 1001 Semmes Ave Richmond VA. It is growing and finding itself in the new mortgage default normal.
good,No room for growth or advancement. Very high turnover rate. Job security with in collections department is almost non existing.
good,Through SunTrust I gained knowledege on all aspects of the lending industry. The mobility they allowed for me to move from dept to dept was insightful. The te4am I worked with was optimistic and valued the definiition of team work.
good,"Sun Trust is a good company in general. However, the department you work for really determine how much you'll enjoy working for the company."
good,"The Security dept under the IT umbrella had turmoil. It was a place that saw many changes in leadership, different cultures, and alot of changes by way of layoffs and major disruption.  I had coworkers that had turnover several times in the IT dept."
good,"Decent opportunity to move up. Training is some of the best I've had in the industry. Cool motivation working in the Company's Home Town. If you get a good manager, you are set!"
good,I learned a lot and a different way of how to do the lockbox. Fast paste and kept me busy. Loved the job the people were cool and helpful. We all became close
good,The job itself is challenging and reflective of a culture that is all about the clients. The people I have met here are from different backgrounds and diverse. I would recommend.
good,"Poor management "
good,"This place doesn't know you exist unless you live in Atlanta or Orlando. Regional bank that thinks it's big, but technology is scattered and outdated. No real guidance in the field."
good,"i like the job and my clients but the job is demanding, changing goals everyday and you never get a raise. Also they will not hire help so they overwork you which enables you to take a break."
good,I love my job and working for the public. I am have grewm a lot in my customer service skills and helping people with all kinds of needs. The hardest part of my job is the management I am under currently. I have had 4 managers in 2 1/2 years and currently the one I have does not support team work and being united as a team.
good,Supports women in leadership. A good starter career but main offices are South. Hours and days are never consistent to ever have two days off of work in a row..
good,"I enjoy working for SunTrust, however, I feel like this isn't much room for me to grow within the company. Your production in this role is key. I am not a fan of the micro management that sometimes takes place."
good,"servicing clients "
good,Good Benefits for health and time off. Room for advancement. 
good,Going up and down grocery isles asking people where they bank was not my cup of tea but its a good company to work for. They are closing stores nationwide.
good,"Their training is poor, the environment of the company is very much based on "
good,"A typical day was started by inputting date into the computer, there was nothing hard about this job, very easy and not a lot of work, some days very slow."
good,SunTrust can be a very stressful place of employment. Some days it appeared the harder you worked the less it was appreciated. Other days were smooth and enjoyable.
good,"A lot of sales involved.  Outbound calling, setting appointments, follow-ups, etc.  Not difficult, but not very exciting either.  Compensation is competitive.  Good bonus program.  I hear benefits are decent (I don't use them)."
good,Big company.A lot of weekly changes. New out-comers needs to adapt fast and work in a fast productive and policy enforce environment.
good,"I really enjoy the people that i work with. I have learned alot from them, I have been here for a while and just ready to learn something new and something different. But I will truly miss the people that I work with."
good,"Struggling to change to culture, SunTrust is moving in the right direction."
good,"Open business and personal acounts"
good,I enjoyed the time I was there.  Then it was time to move on.  I learned a lot during my tenure with the company but in order to advance I had to step away.
good,The job is challenging with change being constant people I work directly with are great.  We work as a team.
good,Learned a lot about the banking systems and customer service.
good,It is hard to advance with them. Turnover rate is very high. The benefits were good. The customers were excellent.
good,Data entry and tenkey processings. Very high paced environment.
good,"This is a great company as a whole, but its not ideal for those with families or single parents. Your schedule changes twice a year and as a result... You won't be able to change with those schedules... Ideal for those with little to no responsibilties and those that don't mind schedule changes each six months..."
good,"The work, clients and co-workers were highlights of this job. The management made it hard to pursue a full career."
good,"Good benefits, flexible work environment, inclusive company policies, and above-average pay. Most work projects at best keep the lights on and the day-to-day work seems pointless. Not a place to begin a career, but a good place for late career moves."
good,The job grade system is antiquated. Score cards used in several positions do not accurately reflect your competence or work ethic. Limited opportunities for projects. Discussing salary or arguing for salary adjustments or pay increases is discouraged. Annual merit increases are non-negotiable. Company recently bought by BB&T so working there while things play out entails a certain risk.
good,"Enjoyed my time with company. We had an awesome team however, as the market declined, so did moral"
good,"Typical day consisted of review loan files, completing them and on to the next."
good,The instore envirment. Causes you to approach random people while they are shopping to gain accounts. When they order promotions you ha e to make sure t are crossed and I dotted when entering your new customer but if you are competitive then this company wl work in your favor
good,"There are so many wonderful things about working for the company. My favorite is probably the flexibility I have with my hours. I also love the company culture and enjoy working with everyone. Friendly team environment. Great learning environment, many benefits, I enjoy the changing environment and competitive atmosphere."
good,"SunTrust has had it's growing pains over the past few years but, I feel sure once they figure out what type of company they want to be, things will get better.  The company culture is fantastic.  There are lots of perks and benefits to working there such as discounts, volunteer opportunities, etc.  In order to progress your career, there may be a relocation required."
good,"SunTrust Robinson has  great people and atmosphere.  New office in new territory so a lot of challenging, new and fun activities. Very nice people.  Thanks"
good,I experienced several management changes within the IT groups.  It was not a pleasant experience and new managers felt threatened by experienced and knowledgeable people.
good,I've leaned at lots  in my years of service with the company. most enjoyable part of my job is my co workers they are like family.
good,"Working for SunTrust has its pros and cons like any other job."
good,"good place to work for, no career advancement, benfits ok, good with time off request. great coworkers, quality review not reviewed well"
good,"Extremely sales driven environment.  Widget driven with a bait and switch approach to selling products to customers. Management is lacking guidance and understanding of banking, regulations and policies and is only sales driven regardless of client needs."
good,Good Employer.  Fast paced environment.    Teammates are great and easy to work an open to change.   The benefits are competitive.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I would suggest this company to other people. Great pay and benefits. I received my foreclosure training from Suntrust. It was a good learning experience
good,A typical day at work would be getting ready to take the next call in the Call Center. I learned one on one banking. The management was not effective. My co-workers were fun and dependable. The hardest part of my job was how quick I needed to be when handling calls even though the calls demanded more time than what management expected. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning about banking for the first time.
good,"not enough pay for the extreme hours (instore location) "
good,"Working for SunTrust would be described as busy and fast pace"
good,"Fun workplace with current teammates. Flexible start times, early morning to early afternoon. Flex day off in the week for working Saturday's."
good,"I waws assigned a cubicle and learned how to read, review, and underwrite mortgages"
good,"My time at Suntrust gave opportunity for growth by gaining knowledge on all aspects of residential and commercial lending process. I worked in a fast paced enviorment, where guidelines changed everyday demanding focus and enthusiasm. The team I worked on was very optomistic and valued the meaning of team work."
good,"I would stay there if the jobs were being outsourced. During my tenure, I worked in a diversified work environment. I was able to learn technics under the new environment."
good,the pay is very good so is the benefits but management is horrible and very negative
good,A typical day includes maintaining a high prospect list of clients and calling to make sure their needs are being met. Updating reports to roll up to corporate and meeting with clients through out the day.
good,"Great place to work, but since people have been there years they are not the easiest to work with as they dont like change."
good,Good people and Very good pay. Health benefits very expensive and not very comprehensive. Should be better for a company the size of SunTrust. Comments reflect situation pre-merger.
good,"Jobs are not based on skills it’s about who you know. "
good,"SunTrust is an excellent company and the culture makes you feel like you're part of a family.  The Closing Department is very fast pace environment.  In order to succeed in your role, you must have a strong command of the Closing Process and the ability to multi-task quickly without sacrificing Quality."
good,"Overall experience was good, but always room for improvement."
good,My reason for leaving was due to it being communicated my role would likely be outsourced which made me feel very uncomfortable. I opted to seek alternative employment.
good,Good company to start your career. I would recommend to someone out of collage but not a seasoned professional looking for a long term career. Management is in place and more often than not look outside for talent to replace them.
good,"Great company to work for. Purpose drive but also sales focused. Its still a business, expect to sell products in retail setting, cold calling, etc. Great leadership."
good,"Very busy, fast paced, sometimes work 12+ hour days, career advancement is hard"
good,"SunTrust is an organization of opportunity for those prepared to work hard. While the politics of HQ can sometimes get in the way of efficient decision-making, overall, this is a great place to work."
good,"SunTrust has decent benefits, but pay increases for employees are quite low and not based on performance.  While I worked there, they placed a cap of 3% on many jobs and limited bonuses.  However, I've been gone for a few years and that may have changed."
good,I would recommend this institution to someone that wants various opportunities and would like to expand his/her career. I was afforded a great opportunity with SunTrust.
good,Well organized company.  Good people...You learned very good skills that you can take with you.  I learned great public relations and wonderful computer knowledge.  Computers were changing at that time..also professional development was available for the changing times.
good,"Typical retail banking job. Great room for advancement. Management could be better, branch to branch basis however. Great benefits and pretty laid back atmosphere. Some referral goals, but nothing extreme."
good,Training experience for those who are in new positions is often conducted by ill-equip leaders/managers. The culture of the workplace is dog-eat-dog and very individualistic in fashion. Administrative process during transition of promotion is not cohesive. There is little communication between hiring manager and training firm or vice versa which leaves trainee befuddled. This is not good business which may speak to their merger.
good,"fast paced, competitive, diverse, relaxed, flexible, hard working environment, diverse environment, flexible hours, diverse group of teammates, can be stressful"
good,Suntrust is great the training is awesome and they care about employees. They have an open door policy and listen to your thoughts and suggestions. It is a good place to grow.
good,"It goes without saying that Sales can be tough. But believing in the services that SunTrust provides can make that stress seem like less of a burden. If you have teammates that are positive and a joy to be around, the rigors of the job may not seem as bad."
good,"A intense project environment. Lot of new technologies and transformation in progress."
good,"Management overview can be too much at times, individual targets are no longer a requirement, more focus on team behaviors and client services. Goals are attainable if  teams work together and incentives are paid based on team goals"
good,"Helping clients with transactions, answering questions, money handling, making referrals and sales, ATM custodian. Management is ok but pressures branch with sales."
good,I liked Suntrust as an employer. They just had immature petty managers who could not distinguish friendships at work and separate them from play relationships.
good,"Great company to work for.  Based in Atlanta, GA which is the headquarters.  Great purpose driven enterprise.  Teammate morale is great and guide by excellent leadership."
good,"Great learning environment. Industry is changing rapidly. The company started a new program for the public, focusing on financial education and implementation."
good,"My experience with SunTrust was good, I worked in local retail bank where I was able to develop my customer relationship skills and abilities; it was unfortunate that I wasn't allowed to utilize my training and licenses in life, health, annuities as was discussed during my interview. Changes in management staffing at regional level did not correct the issue with the branch manager who was unprofessional and shouldn't have been in that position, she cost the bank thousnads of dollars in lost revenue with her poor decisions."
good,"Challenging. The Firm is serious about it's people so they look for culture fit in addition to intelligence and experience.You will have the opportunity to work closely with Service Teams, Infrastructure and Business Development"
good,"good place to work, everyone was helpful. management was good. environment was good.  Too many customer surveys. changes in the way pay was structured and referrals from branches is why I decided to look for other opportunities"
good,"The best thing about SunTrust is they pay well and have an excellent benefit package. As far as a typical day at work, its pretty cookie cutter. You come in, you work on the phones in a call center environment and go home. The management is professional and they are all nice people. However, there is no feeling that there is anything being done to improve the teammate experience."
good,"great benefits, discounts, free financial guidance, and excellent school program for advancement in career. I am currently enrolled in the program and it has given me enlightenment on how weather, mental state, and other issues in the world effect the economy."
good,Enjoyed working at SunTrust. The pay was good and benefits were OK. Allow flexibility to work from home and encourage using all available time off. No complaints
good,The experience is different for everyone. I no longer want to be there in my current capacity. Teammates are not heard. The business regimen is not based on the business.
good,SunTrust is leaning away towards private traditional office environments.  Modern workplace standards will apply in most roles unless you have direct reports that are co-located within your office.  Please keep this in mind when you are considering a role here.  This is not a negative but some professionals may have a difficult time adapting to this.
good,Reach out to borrowers and collect what is needed.  Work with Loan Officers and closers for a smooth closing.  At the time management was not very helpful.  When asked for help it was always figure it out or try your best.  Made a mistake and they made you feel like you were not cable of anything.
good,Suntrust is a great place to work if you enjoy dealing with the public. Suntrust has the ability to be one of the top banks in the area because they do back up the employees.
good,"My overall experience with Suntrust was good.  I continued to take on multiple responsibilities and when it was time for my review, I was given a 4 with the explanation that no one gets a 5.  I pay truly did not reflect the work I was doing."
good,"Good pay, have to make goals. Most managers are great, a few are terrible. All coaches are great; they really try to help you improve and meet your goals."
good,"Suntrust is a great place to work. All of the managers are nice, they just need to pay more attention to the important things like occurrences for new hires & the training needs to be longer than 1 month. That’s a lot of information to take in within 3 weeks."
good,"Its an ok job , good pay, good name, good buildings. good people, good times, good computers, good tables, good chairs, good lights, good windows, and good animals."
good,"The work culture is pretty good, flexible working from home and nice people willing to help everywhere"
good,"Monday through Satuday. Generally, open to close. Staffing model dictates helping teller line, missing liunches and generally making due with what we have in the branch. Average typically 45 hours per week. Retail environment with corresponding goals."
good,"Great place to work if you are willing to relocate. Teammates works well with each others. Overall, its a great place to work. Their operation system is becoming up to current standerd."
good,"The job was great.  The ""sales"" portion of being a teller did not go over well with me.  I am not a sales person.  That is the only part of the teller position I struggled with."
good,A solid place to work. Good people with integrity. Good executives. Inclusive management style. The place offers a fast paced work environment and challenging work.
good,"Great benefits and good people to work with, but limited opportunity for growth.  No reward for longevity.  Good location for local restaurants and library."
good,"The environment is very entrepreneurial as the bank continues to grow to compete with other larger, more established banks.  Collaborative environment where employees work to find solutions for clients rather than pitch product"
good,"A typical day for me at SunTrust started at 1pm to 7pm. I was a part time teller in an in-store branch. I was the only male at the branch of five people...a branch manager, assistant branch manager, FSR and another teller."
good,Suntrust is an okay company to work for.  They care about bottom line.  I preferred working to other companies as I was not given freedom to find solutions.
good,It's been 20 years since I worked for this organization.  However it was a great place to work.  I left to pursue  a career in human resources development.
good,"It is good to work, friendly environment,daily meetings , learned how to manage the the team.good health benifits, large amounts if testing as the hardest part in the work"
good,"I loved this job. Good benefits, time off. This was my favorite job. It was fast paced and very stressful at times. I loved the customers and only had issues with one manager."
good,"In our specific area we began utilizing the AGILE process this current year.  So our focus has been improving our performance under AGILE format.  Management expectation is that the staff should accommodate business deliverables in a timely manner.  Managing the user stories through AGILE that have been assigned to you based on the turnaround time for deployment.  Very good working environment, somewhat diversified."
good,"Great place to work! I would recommend the job to other as well.  The management team is good but most are in Atlanta, which can be hard to move up due to low exposure for the Richmond team."
good,In order to enjoy your job as an In-Store Representatives you must have the patience and skill necessary to complete the work of a teller and platform bank in a timely fashion.
good,"fast paced work environment"
good,Good place to work with adequate training. The hardest part is getting loans closed in a timely manner. They have weekly meetings that are helpful with keeping up with banking laws.
good,SunTrust was a regional bank that wanted to improve on its placement and put tremendous pressure on the branches. My belief was that SunTrust did not look closely enough at the branches to come up with realistic goals for braches to be successful. All of the branch managers that I knew are all on to other careers now.
good,"I learnt a lot about the business banking industry, in addition to lot of products and services that banks offer.  Great, great, great, great, great.."
good,"This is one of the best projects which i worked when i was in IGate Solutions,Pune. I learnt a lot in this project mostly high availability,performance monitoring,optimization..."
good,"Within the financial industry, the technology curve has been progressing quickly over the past ten years.  However, the leadership at SunTrust has taken a measured approach to implementing new technology along with processes and procedures.  While this has helped SunTrust avoid some of the pitfalls of bleeding-edge technology, it has also prevented them from satisfying all of their clients' needs."
good,"some people love banking, some people hate. I don't love it. I don't love, but then again I don't love sales. I liked the teller part of the job so maybe had I just been a teller I would have liked it more. As far as the company goes, they are a pretty good company to work for."
good,"Typical day is answering average between 100-150 calls depending on which day it is. I've learned a lot of great things at Suntrust especially how to multi task efficiently and effectively. My direct Manager if very new to the job so that's why I gave her 1 star. Culture is great, job is great"
good,I enjoyed my time at Suntrust and would recommend it to others. I enjoyed the flexible work hours. I appreciated the fact that it gave full time benefits for part time employment.
good,"I really enjoyed working at SunTrust until changes started being made. The hardest part of the job was getting referrals, making sales. The most enjoyable part of the job, waiting on the customers."
good,It was a good job to have.  I learned a lot I got a chance to work from home but would have really liked a chance to advance with in the company more.
good,senior management is out of touch with branch banking. they try to make us robots and everything the same without a personal touch. hard to get assistance when needed- no one knows who to contact to get answers or things done. they are making a mistake going away from their previous customer service focus they had in the past.
good,"A typical day at work is greeting clients that walk through the door and be confident and happy to make deposits or withdrawals, etc in SunTrust bank. You need to make simple transactions while being friendly and occasionally help them get to a banker for any additional needs with promotions or accounts."
good,"Not a bad environment to work in, the benefits are good. The initial training process isn't bad, but once you get into your position its kind of learn as you go. The systems are very outdated. The upper Management doesn't seem to have very much compassion for the team members inside the branches."

good,"This is a very good company to work for and loved working for them. I would work for them at anytime. A typical day at work would be enjoying my manager , I loved working from home."
good,Suntrust cares about it's customers and employees. I enjoyed interacting with customers and providing excellent customer service.
good,My day normally consists of taking calls all day long with customers inquiring about their SunTrust Accounts. My co-workers (peers) are very good to work with inside the office. Pay hasn't been flexible and I haven't felt that advancement through the company is that attainable.
good,"This company is fun to work for other than the strict enforcement of referral goals. With this company, it essentially all about the numbers."
good,can be busy at times. enjoy working with my coworkers.I would recommend anyone to work here. Hardest part is when staff is short handed.
good,"able to work at my own pace to meet production, , pleasant coworkers.  pay could have been better, but overall nce place to work"

good,Everyday I help my clients strengthen their financial well being. This is very enjoyable. I work with a great team that strives to put client's needs first.
good,"Stressful, great benefits, great vacation time."
good,Company enjoys a strong reputation and is well-positioned in the equipment-financing and -leasing industry.  Management is currently engaged in better aligning the role of the leasing company with the Bank.

good,Employees work with each other to share knowledge of the ever changing world of fraud. Employees have the option to work from home.
good,"Suntrust has been a great company and is showing potential for growth.  I have enjoyed being a branch manager and would like to continue, but the leadership has proven to be less than supportive in my success."
good,SunTrust is a good place to work that presents employees with ability to meet goals and become more engaged in the job.  What I liked most about the last department I worked in was the flexibility to work at home or on site and the independece I was given to set my own goals and accomplish all tasks by being self motivated and taking pride in my work.
good,"Enjoyed the job very much and the staff co-workers were stellar.  We hit our goals and were #1 in our region, but Suntrust elected to close 100 offices last year and mine was one of them.  They did not retain any staff members and the office was closed 06/07/2014.  The decision to close my office was made probably before I was even hired.  They are trying to continue to be profitable in a difficult market."
good,Typically I spend the majority of my time managing a vendor who run our internal vulnerability scans.  I have recently become certified as a GWAPT.

good,"	Developed Test Plans."
good,"I worked as a telecommuter for the Customer Care Department."
good,"SunTrust Bank is an excellent  place to work for to start the career in a banking industry. Great management with great and qualified employees. Usually a day at work goes smooth with full of excitement the minute they open their door for clients. All the co-workers are very helpful if there is any issue or problem. I have learned a lot for example, dealing with different clients from different countries and ethnicity, listen their concerns and handle each situation in accordance with bank's policies and procedures. The most important thing I learned is being professional, positive attitude, ready to help clients the minute they open the doors."
good,"SunTrust has the right priorities of helping clients with financial well-being and measured growth. The team works well together. The biggest challenge is the sales production side of the house, because the opportunity for growth from existing clients is finite."

good,"SunTrust has been nothing but a beacon of opportunity to learn and grow within the banking industry. It has afforded me a variety of opportunities to work within different branches of banking, and see how other lines of business within the company tie directly into my daily work life. Within the branch team, relations are so important; there is so much value placed on working well together towards one goal. Management works closely with me as a supervisor to be sure our team is working through any difficulties, and also working at the best of their abilities. Being in banking; which is also a customer service industry, the top priorities are to make sure the customers are satisfied and to also do what is best for the client's financial well-being; therein lies the most enjoyable and difficult part of the job."
good,"It pays well with great benefits. It has a very high turnover because they keep giving guidelines and quotas to be met, but fail to give you the proper education and tools to accomplish them."
good,This is actually a laid back environment for what they pay you. Moving up in this company would likely require you to have a Bachelors Degree or to know someone in a hiring position who can ask to see your resume and give you a job
good,I have enjoyed working at Suntrust but feel a change would be good.  I have learned how to be accurate and efficient in a very unyielding environment that is extremely fast paced.

good,Good company with great training and support. I would recomend to other loan originators.
good,This place was a great place to work because of my direct report and manager.

good,Nice location and accessible to all major interstates.  Co-workers are friendly and willing to assist.
good,"Provided opportunity to continue education, great sales environment, great incentive to work hard"
good,I enjoyed this job because I learned new things and realized quite a bit about myself and what direction I wanted to head towards.
good,"It was a great experience.  Much was learned as to what all is involved with processing a loan from the beginning to the end of closing.  The co-workers were very friendly and helpful to work with.  The hardest part of the job was to correct a loan that had a lot of missing information and errors that has just been assigned to you several hours before it is closing; as a result, the paralegal or attorneys cannot understand why they do not have the closing package sitting on their desks several days before the loan is about to close….  Due to bank regulations, the loan is not allowed to be sent with out all corrections being made and an audit review.  This position requires one to wait on others to do their job correctly and or remind them of changes that need to be made due to changed circumstances.  This happens continuously.  The most enjoyable part of the job was editing and finding errors to correct when enough time is given.  It's a fulfilling experience."
good,"The Company has a good reputation among Banks including very high customer loyalty.  "
good,"customer service "

good,Great training in others centered sales. Good work/life balance.
good,"productive, excellent incentive program, supervisors are willing to help always available for assistance"
good,"Unfortunately when they hired me, the refinance boom was still going strong.  Then as rates went up, business went down and they are shutting down their Wholesale Division and I will be losing my job.  It just never made sense why a region of the company (Schaumburg) which has a large area (Midwest Region) only had 4 account executives to handle 5 states.  Not the best way to keep business coming in the door."
good,"My typical day consist of following up on email, going into my que and uploaded loans into my pipeline to review. once review is complete complete steps to route to next step in process by completing task and scanning docs to processor. I dont consider anypart of the job hard as a matter of fact everyday was a learning experience for me. Management was always available and ready to help when needed. the most enjoyable part of the job was very little micro-manangement, I like to be shown what to do and then allowed to do it."
good,I have been with the company for four years and have enjoyed my experience with the bank.

Research and provide missing documents for clients and investors. From Management I have learned to be firm and stay on top of everything. Take all opportunity to apply yourself.

good,"Atlanta, great weather"
good,I worked with a great group of coworkers that got me started in banking.

good,"Multi Phase ARGO Teller system project which will enhance bank teller system make it more automated and will provide check images. No need for retention of documents. It syncs with other business applications used for GL Accounting and auto reconciles all the Debits and Credits for the cost centre (branch). A major part of this project is assigning sub-ledgers and coding GL’s so they post to the correct ledgers. The sub ledgers which are missing offsets are manually adjusted to the proper GL’s. Cash Optimizer was implemented for commercial accounts, I was part of upgrades and recommended features which enhanced features and made it more users friendly."
good,"I started this career as a peak-time teller and in less than one year, I became full time with great benefits for me and my family.  Over the years I've been able to work as a Teller Lead, and a Operations Specialist.  With this company you can move up the ladder quick.  With great leaders and fun co-workers, and hard work  you can grow into becoming what you like, the posibilities are endless!"

good,Data entry. Learned more about mortgages so in the future I know what to look and ask for.
good,Work with Clients to inditify financial solutions that specifically fit their needs. I help my clients reach financial well being.
good,"Typical day at work starts with customer service. I am constantly learning new things daily, that help better me at my job. The people that I work with are great and easy to get along with. I have to say, the hardest part of the job is the thought in the back of your mine of potentially being robbed. I can say that I have experienced it first hand, and do not want to have to go through that again. The best part of the day are the clients that come through the door. It's great having conversations with people and getting to know their life experiences. Not any one person has the same story."
good,Culture is like none I've ever known with any other employer!
good,I have learned to be veriy flexible to aide in the consistent production.
good,Just like every other bank with an emphasis on customer service
good,"Good management that allows you to develop into your role by providing appropriate guidance. Generally, the employees want to be there and look forward to working with colleagues to deliver the company to the client."
good,I enjoy working with people and helping them meet their financial needs. SunTrust corporate values enable and allows me to do that successfully.
good,"A typical day at work coming in for a meeting, focusing on which area we can approve in selling bank products and working on improving our cross sells ratios. Also being a coach and oberserving teammates on how they can increase their interaction with a client. There is no real hard part of the job, especially when you have a strong team to work with. The most enjoyable part is coming into work with a smile and walking out with a smile."
good,"A typical day at work was morning meeting over the phone with the Area Manager. Then meet with your teammates (colleagues), so everyone can know the goals for the week and the stretch goal for the month.Once, you have spoken to the team and everyone have gave their commitments for the week. It will be time to open the door to service the clients. The things are learned here was excellent coaching and development techniques. I learned how to market certain brands and how to show through your actions that you care about the clients well being. The management was great. They work together as a team. The communication was very open. The co-workers were nice as well. The hardest part of the job was when the branch was short staff with tellers. Then it became were the manager or another platform teammate had to stop what they pre-plan and be the teller for that day to service the client. The most enjoyable part was at the end of the week to shout out that our branch have made their goals and to personal congratulate my branch teammates for the help and fantastic support."
good,"Growth opportunities are there, but the money is not. If you want to change jobs you can only increase your salary about 2% from what you were making originally. Therefore you are never really able to gain an opportunity and make the salary as someone off of the street. so its really hard to move around in the company and actually get paid for it."
good,"If you don't need to make a lot of money, this job is tollerable."
good,"SunTrust is a place where you can grow as a professional. The workplace culture allows you to be yourself. There are many opportunities with working with this company which include tuitinon reimbusrsement, and great benefits"
good,Training was based on getting you into the branch as fast as possible. If you have a good manager things should go smoothly. Just be prepared to answer questions you might not know the answer to with little help.
good,I enjoyed working there but during my employement there I discovered I was pregnant and high risk so I had to leave this job. But while I was there I was always on time and I didn't miss a day of work.
good,Life-Work Balance exceptional. Work from home at least 1 day a week. Great Culture. People Friendly. Good management always interested in your well being.
good,I was fortunate to have great supervisors and team leads when I worked in the closing department. Great management in the department made all the difference.
good,"I advanced in multiple positions during my 15 years there.  Management was good.  It was laid back in the positions I had, as long as you got your stuff done."
good,"Workplace was fair, not much information given out.  They had to many projects, but didn't know where to start, and how to start it.  They kept changing along the way, but slow in advising employees about changes."
good,"Work was always available until jobs started going to offshore in India. I learned alot and grew alot"
good,I dont have anything to say really. If you come to work and do your job you won't have any issues. Each manager is different. Plenty of over time if you want it.
good,"I truly enjoyed this company, but after finding out my branch was closing the week prior to Christmas we found out that they were getting rid of the entire team. We were number 1 leading BC2 branch out of the 22 surrounding."
good,"Good Company.    Provided on the job training.  Provided good employee benefits.  Salary reviews were fair, but raises were very conservative. Open culture."
good,"stressful sales goals"
good,I loved working at SunTrust.  Our flexibility for work from home was decided by our direct manager.  I was let go in a reduction in force. I hope to get transferred to another job at SunTrust.
good,"I enjoyed working with my co workers we always had a lot of fun at our center the managers were very nice they didn't micro manage & we always got the job done. "
good,allot of employee turnover during the time I worked there. I have been employed at other Financial Intuitions with little or no turnover. No consistency of Upper management.
good,The job atmosphere was chill not to uptight. My Direct Supervisors were great but Upper Upper management was awful. They would make decision based on God knows what. They were contacted with the front line or entry level position.
good,"SunTrust went through many changes in my time there ( really from 1997-2008), merging with Crestar, eliminating their IT Support division in 2008.  It did provide many opportunities for exposure to a variety of systems applications and its support."
good,"Results-focused Marketing and Procurement executive with 20+ years’ experience building and developing teams, excelling in category management and cost take out, risk and supplier management.  Consistent record of delivering on business goals and forming close working relationships with C level executives and supplier leadership teams.  Sought after speaker on Marketing Procurement at industry conferences."
good,"SunTrust has a great purpose and great teammates. The managers are collaborative and listen to feedback from teammates. Overall, SunTrust is a great company."
good,"I have a great manager.   I am leaving to relocate. The workload seems never ending.  I am not sure if it is because there is so much to do, there aren't enough competent people, and/or I don't know how to say 'No' very well.  I enjoy my teammates."
good,"Good people to work with.  Performed administrative/financial tasks for a variety of clients.  Ultimately, management desired more applicable college experience."
good,"The typical day was laid out hourly via workforce management, letting us know when we could eat and take breaks.  My job required me to be ready to take calls on a variety of mortgage specific calls.  Management varied depending on which manager you had, some were good, and some were not.  The community that fellow coworkers strove to build made it feel very comfortable, and I do miss that.  The hardest part of the job for me was feeling tethered to my desk, if it was time for you to be at your desk and taking calls, there was little excuse for anything else.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping my clients to solve their problems."
good,You can work on the same technology for years. They follow old and legacy processes. Good place to work. Nothing much you can learn new as per market standards.
good,I worked as a Mortgage Underwriter for SunTrust mortgage and was recently laid off due to a reduction in the workforce.  I'd go back in the opportunity presented itself.
good,"Perks have really gone downhill.  No more coffee, tea, etc... in the break rooms, offices are a thing of the past so enjoy the open floor plan!  Still has a nice mix of folks and you will likely make some lifelong friends working @ SunTrust.  It's a business bank with solid products you aren't ashamed to peddle and you don't feel like you've pushed anything useless on the clients.  Management is good about right solutioning and not overselling for the most part."
good,"good company to work but very unstable. goal posts keep shifting."
good,"Great organization with heart in the right place overall.  In an effort to meet investor expectations and keep up with larger competitors the company has undergone massive amounts of change.  Significant movement in the C-Suite, significant organizational restructuring that does not seem to slow down, or give adequate time for strategies to bear fruit."
good,short staffed; inadequate executives and top managers; goals are unattainable in certain demographics; limited exposure due to in store locations; great work environment
good,assisted teammates and clients. Lack of advancement. always made departments fun. with activities. learned customer service. difficult to get back w/this bank when I was a previous employee.
good,"However, be warned, they do have a reputation, well earned, in their mortgage processing/underwriting areas to hire up, over staff, then have to layoff.  Happens over and over."
good,"Competitive, success is possible if you are patient, dedicated and work hard.  Hardest is working with a few teammates just there to get a paycheck. The best part is working with other dedicated teammates that enjoy the camaraderie of working on a team and being successful together."
good,"Pros"
good,"I enjoyed working with Customers and developing relationships and helping the clients with desired needs. The hardest part about this job was selling and not enough staffing.  I miss the job but was stressful when it can to meeting certain goals. I have always enjoyed working one on one with clients and giving them a sense of security each visit they made to the branch.  Branch was very busy and short staffed which made it uncomfortable at times keeping customers happy with wait times, which at times made me uncomfortable but my focus was to keep focus on customer in front of you to listen for other needs in the banking industry."
good,I gain positive experience everywhere I work.  Positive no negatives I would like to see other people go far and pursue there goals at the company good luck.
good,"It was a nice place to work, position was very informative ant the information really help me understand working with mortgages in the banking system. the job allow the to work with other lenders to make"
good,Good place to work - good benefits.  There is opportunity for advancement. Most managers are good some not so much.  Only real downfall is layoffs - can happen in an instant
good,Suntrust Mortgage was a learning experience for me I loved learning about the different loans with a dash of the banking side. My job requirements was simple and a lot of things was straight forward. no ill call you back or well we might...it was always yes or no and this is what it is and that's what I liked.
good,This is not a bad company. The pay is not equal to the work the bonus structure is not good at all for a processor let alone a sr. processor and was changed once I was hired.
good,"SunTrust values people in a fantastic way at the junior levels. But, when you move into the senior ranks, it (like most other large corporates) is a boys club characterized by who likes you versus how good you are at your job. The same people are tapped over and over for opportunities and it's hard to break into the club."
good,"Nice place to work for if given the opportunity of a permanent position."
good,I enjoyed my experience with Suntrust just not enough  room for advancement inside of the call center dept but as a whole its a really good company to work for . My passion is customer service so helping my clients understand finances was a pleasure. Management was fair. Call center life is not for everyone you have to have a very open mind.
good,Time is of the essence. Time makes you start to dislike the way that things are going. I loved SunTrust in the begging and have my concerns about it now.
good,I would do transactions as well as have conversations with my customers. I learned a  great deal about banking from my co-workers. The management was fine but mainly learned from my supervisors. The hardest part of the job was really dealing with the rude customers. The most enjoyable part was the co-workers as well as the regular customers that would come in.
good,Suntrust has a great work life balance.   They also are supportive of new technologies and provide training to those that require it.
good,a typical day at work would spend more time at the teller and not making any sells or meeting goals. Worked on a in store supermarket very difficult to talk to clients bout banking. Working hours were very and 7 days a week.
good,"Great company, good benefits, hours are good accept occasional Saturdays. However, you have sales goals and quotas you have to meet every month. Upper management needs to understand different demographics and why some goals are not attainable. For Example: I work for a branch located in a very high income/retired area with also an abundance of lower income families.  The retirees already have financials in order and are not seeking Financial Advisors. They also have their homes paid for and are receiving Social Security and retirement pensions. Thus, they do not want to take loans out against there homes.  Also, the lower income individuals who need loans and credit cards can not get approved because of income and credit requirements.  I have a friend on the other side of town who constantly meets goals therefore gets their incentives because their demographics are people from their late 20s to early 50s. These are the years where people want to borrow money and are looking for homes/financial advice."
good,"Strong Culture"
good,A typical day is having a morning huddle to discuss what your game plan is for that day.  Then opening the doors and start helping clients and making sure that you provide excellent customers.  If you are at a very busy branch there is little down time to complete  other tasks.
good,"Its difficult to rate this company as it has been 17 years since I was employed there. Also I worked there for a year. But it was an interesting job. I was able to visit merchants and set them up to take credit cards from their customers. I enjoyed that aspect a lot. Compensation overall was good. The most difficult aspect would have been the goals one had to reach in Merchant Services. I made these goals but bonuses were based on this, but to be fair I had worked there for 1 year so I was just becoming trained at that point. I really did not have coworkers as I was a Merchant representative."
good,Management is awesome at SunTrust.  Direct manager and upper management show concern for their employees.  Their benefits package needs to be reworked.  Not that excited about the options given.
good,Very positive work environment. Very open lines of communication with managers and a fairly respectable work life balance. Compensation is mediocre at best.
good,It was a fun place to work and had some great people that wok there.  I think they are a good bank and provide great events.  They do great charity work and give their employees time to do it as well.
good,"It's a sales intensive environment, and it's increasing. The leadership isn't bad, but there are a lot of branches that need to reassess who they have working. Very negative teammates at a lot of the branches."
good,I would come in daily get on the phone. I learned different ways to talk to people. My last manager is amazing. My co-workers were great help. Hardest spot is telling people no when you i wanted to help.
good,"Several programs in place for promotion, every holiday and weekend off but the pay is stingy. The culture is based upon the department you're in and the manager you're subordinate to."
good,"Enjoy the interactions with clients, and being able to help them with the financial concerns and needs"
good,My co-workers and myself are dedicated to the highest quality customer satisfaction. I have learned many new things under my managers wing associated with the mortgage industry.
good,"My job title requires me to go back and forth between the teller line and the platform area. It involves me to balance both areas correctly, efficiently and in a timely manner. We each play an important role at the bank where it leads us to be a better team player. The most important part of the job is to make sure we understand the clients financial well-being and to help them with results. Overall, the company is a great place to work for but to advance in my career I have to proceed."
good,"I'm a full-time student and have been a PT teller at SunTrust for two years. They are great working with my schedule. I must say the benefits are a plus but I've never gotten a raise. The management varies depending on the branch that you're at which can be annoying (lack of consistency with regulations/cutting corners). There is also a lot of pressure with reaching sales/point goals. I've seen teammates attain phenomenal numbers and never get praise; instead, they would get pressured for more. The most enjoyable part is meeting people within the community and building upon those relationships and genuinely helping clients reach a financial well-being. I've also got to work with great people that have become great friends."
good,"No problems with co-workers or management. "
good,"• Ordered needed documents via phone/email/fax."
good,"I enjoyed working at SunTrust,  I enjoyed everyone I worked with.  All were for intense individuals but enjoyed it.  Management changed the last year or so and it was time to move on"
good,"Typically a Very Busy Work place Call Center, Relocating back to Atlanta for Family Purposes, Overall Job is at times stressful but yet manageable."
good,"Best part of the job is always being busy. Processing, underwriting & closing in the same location - helps for open communication to move the loans quickly to a decision and closing"
good,"Good company to work for, learned a lot. Provided opportunities to learn other functions in the collection department. Management was good, very workable and knowledgable"
good,I really liked working at BOA because the pay was $16.00 per hour before I was laid off. I met a lot of people and they treated like you were a part of the company. A typical day at BOA was pleasant and friendly. You never felt like a temp worker there. The hardest part was not being permanent working there.
good,"A typical day at SunTrust I would say would be great I could take incoming calls from customers and provide outstanding customer service skills. "
good,"The uniqueness of the Privately Held Investment department is that it is a niche area in Private Wealth Management. There are no two assets under management that are the same. The aspect that’s enjoyable the most is that it is not a mundane position, change is always prevalent. Management pushes you so that you produce your best work (making strong recommendations, completing asset reviews, completing pricing for the closely held asset, etc.). The take away is, in order to make a solid recommendation to the fiduciary committees, you begin to predict and answer the questions that may be asked while defending your recommendation proposal. You get an in-depth knowledge of how a business should be ran and view their strengths, weakness, opportunities, and possible threats that pertains to that privately held business."
good,"Offers exposure to many faucets of the business"
good,"Sales Specialist for 'At Work' program, supporting 200+ branches in Atlanta area.  In addition to business development and partnering with internal business partners, I also provided coaching/training materials and sales communications for the SunTrust at Work program for the branches."
good,"SunTrust was a great place to work,  I had a wonderful group of teammates/co-workers and managers that I consider friends."
good,"Really enjoyed my initial group of employees. "
good,"High volume, multi state closings.  Management kept us very updated and informed as to new federal, state and company guidelines.  All closers worked together as a team with processors and underwriters to unsure efficient and timely closings. Everyone was always ready to answer any questions and support each other. the amount of knowledge I obtained was greatly informative and ongoing. The most difficult part of my job was staying on top of all new regulations and compliances for each state.  The closers become a strongly knit team, almost like a family, leaving was very difficult.  More often than not, time flew and we forgot to take lunch breaks and worked overtime. We did what all we could to close the loans. The management stood behind you and wouldn't let anyone blame you for others mistakes.  I was very pleasantly surprised as to how the management went to bat for it's closers"
good,"A typical day at work is teller transactions, coaching fellow co-workers on referrals and service excellence, cash balancing, ordering cash and banking supplies.  Being at Suntrust has taught me the one team approach; working together to achieve one goal.  My manager is a great mentor.  My branch works together as one.  We are always helping each other with questions and clients.  The hardest part of my job is when I am not able to find a solution for my client.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when I can resolve an issue with a client.  Also helping my teamates grow within the company."
good,"I really like working for SunTrust Mortgage; however, I am being affected by a company RIF (Reduction in Force) as of September 5, 2013.  I find the company is caring to its employees and the management team is very approachable and understanding to work with.  The company lets you work on your own as long as you are meeting your weekly production goals.  They allow you to work from home a couple of days per month as well which is a wonderful perk! .  You are not micro-managed but management does expect you to work while you are there and get the job done.  My Underwriting Dept is fairly large and I like how all the Team Leads and Supervisors/Managers know your name and actually go to your desk each morning and say good morning.  There really isn't any difficult part of the underwriting job if you manage your time well and are given the proper tools required to do the job, which SunTrust does provide.  SunTrust will sometimes buy breakfast or lunch for the staff or have ice cream afternoons which is really nice.  The management team also has some dept contests sometimes that the employees can win little prizes such as an extra day to work from home or extra time off on your lunch break, that sort of thing. Overall, SunTrust is a great company to work for.  "
good,"A typcial day of work at SunTrust is usually busy. We have friendly client's who come in on a day to day basis along with non clients who we welcome into joining our financial team. From day one I was taught to sell a certain amount of products, and get so many appointments set up for our manager/personal banker. Coworkers gladly work with each other as a team to make our goals set. The hardest part of my job is to deny client's who wish to recieve a product and they dont qualify for it. At SunTrust its always fun to work with differnt type of people along the day, as well as having friendly compitions on our referrals."
good,"Great place to work with opportunities. I came into the company as a temp and was offered a permanent position soon after. Your co-workers become great lifelong friends almost like family. "
good,"Suntrust Bank was my first banking job. They have a really great training program for everyone employed there. Since I've started working as an Instore teller, there were plenty of opportunity to grow. A typical day there would be opening a teller window, referral customers that needs loans, open new accounts, ask for referrals. balancing the ATM, Vault, and teller drawer."
good,"I worked for SunTrust for 17 years and I really enjoyed the benefits, flexibility, rewards. I learned from the SunTrust University many skills in the banking industry."
good,"A typical day consist of following opening branch procedures in order to began the business day. Also, I’m charged with running morning operations huddles to discuss operational excellence procedures. Daily we meet with branch management to discuss sales goals and strategies to reach those goals. What I’ve learned most is that when you encounter bad attitudes from co-workers you have to learn to put aside feelings and focus. The hardest part of the job is managing personalities to keep everyone satisfied in order to reach common goals. The most enjoyable part of everyday are the smiles I’m able to garner from clients when I assist them in reaching financial goals."
good,till now i didnt face any problem in project
good,the most enjoyable part of my job is helping clients and my fellow teammates
good,Take incomming calls for 9hrs. I have learned more abou the financial industry and better customer service skills. Management for the most part is helpful with development. But the corporation has been making alot of changes from the top to the bottom. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the complaints of branch personnel regarding policies and procedures. The most enjoyable part is morale of the work place and a teamwork atmosphere.
good,Hardest part of the job is to keep multiple clients happy when several projects are in demand at the same time.
good,"fraud investigation is hard work but rewarding, great employees, lots of training and advancement."
good,Not much management involvement
good,"During my time at SunTrust during the course of the day, calls consisted of escrow, requests for loan documents, correction of misapplied payments, subordination requests, loss claims info and so much more I learned the importance of educating yourself about the home buying process! Knowing when your taxes and hazard insurance is due is vital. Storing and being able to locate your mortgage documents in case of refinancing or audits saves time and undue stress. Interaction with various departments and their functions within mortgage was very enlightening."
good,"Be careful with this company. words to live by. coworker are great management is usually good, uppermanagement doesnt have a clue what its like to actually work in the branches. hardest part of the job is working short staffed and noone caring about your stress levels."
good,"Professional but needs a new boost of life , and better organized management .. equal oppertunities for employees"
good,"This branch was a great place to work. My only concerns with this company was the change from Customer 1st environment to the push to sell regardless of it benefiting the client. In addition, the opportunity to grow in this branch was not possible."
good,good place to work. The people are good to work for. cna be fun
good,I in geberal like the peopl but the work hours just wasnt right for me but the benefits and pay was good and a good company to work for.
good,"Loved the individuals I worked with everyday."
good,Previous Suntrust leadership created a great culture for the past couple of years. The person responsible for that left last year and things changed a bit. Hopefully the get back on track.
good,The place to work was fine. But I felt picked on by management always giving me more and more work I ran the drive up I had to balance cash machines we had at that time I also use to balance the vault and balance the drive up machines
good,Working at SunTrust is a fast paced environment. It challenges you in a positive way. Nothing is ever consistent and you learn something new every day. There's plenty of room for advancement and although the upper management can use some more training on how to manage large teams. This is truly a great company to work for.
good,An average work day was typically 8:30 to 5:00.  Very faced paced with little time for breaks or lunch.  You are encouraged to perform above and beyond your job title and are rewarded for doing so.  The recent merger announcement with BB&T has had an impact on morale due to the many layoffs and resignations.
good,Opening and closing the branch; assisting client w/ monetary needs such as withdrawals and deposits; notary services; maintaining branch operations; regulations and policies.
good,Enjoyed my time there. I grew with the company. Learned a lot. Led by example and have years of experience from this company. I have learned from mistakes
good,The only draw back is they like to hire in bulk and let go in bulk as needed. Benefits were great and the pay with bonuses was very competitive.You should get at least a year before having to worry about being let go.
good,Loved working for this company. It is very excepting to al cultures and this generation in this day and time. I would love to stay but I am needing better opportunities to promote.
good,"SunTrust has a good company culture.  I do feel the executive leadership of the company needs to provide better vision and direction.  I also feel that there needs to be a better level of accountability, training, and mentoring at all levels.  The work life balance is good, but the company needs to formalize their work from home policy to continue to hire top talent.  The company has way to many meetings and needs to find a better more efficient management structure."
good,Company supports voluntary service and community involvement as well as remote working environment. The company does have too many levels of Management
good,"ok job, retail in office environment good benefits, ok compensation. Relentless chase after goals all day everyday. I had few good managers and one terrible micromanaging sob."
good,If you are getting into the working world. This is good place to start. There's a lot of training provided and there multiple locations around. There is room for growth.
good,CEO is well liked and respected. Typically week is about 50-60 hours. I have had great managers and loved working with every team I have worked with or for.
good,"SunTrust is an amazing place to work. I’ve been with the company for 14 plus years, and have been presented with many opportunities to grow. Some days are more hectic then others, depending on the approaching task and deadlines. I wish my department had flexible work conditions, like working from home or working a flex schedule (10/4)."
good,working all kinds of requests for our clients. I learned how to multi-task and use other systems I never knew of. The culture is very diverse and everyone mingles with eachother.
good,I was promoted to a management position after 4 years.  Company provides great benefits and just started remote workling.  The only thing I wish they had was bonuses for mid line managers or team leads.
good,Banking culture which is great for families. I really like the ability to be able to get home and spend time with the kids before they go to bed. Now since they are older I am looking to get in the Hospitality industry.
good,"I love this company and would recommend anyone to work here. However, like most big organizations there are difficulties that you will face, especially moving up in the organization."
good,"Fast-paced environment; great clients; not much of promotion from the inside, though. Very difficult to move from retail to the corporate aspect of the company."
good,"I have enjoyed working for the company of SunTrust. Unfortunately, I worked with an unethical manager for over a year. Pervious employees, other managers, corporate all knew that this person was this way and did nothing to remove them. Finally after my year with them, they were removed. Since then, it was continued to be wonderful to work for the company. I do find that with SunTrust always wanting to push product does not suit our clients, and upsets them often."
good,Solid management and company appears to have come through many re-structures and now has a clear operating vision.  I would not hesitate to work for STI or recommend.
good,I believe it's a nice company to work for with a decent culture. Management is very helpful. Good work life balance. They can definitely improve the benefits and salary.
good,"Took 160 calls per day. Very difficult at first, but in about 3 months developed a rhythm and understanding of the various processes. Moved later to their IT department."
good,I enjoyed my time with the company.  I didn't enjoy the work so much but I liked the people I worked with a lot.  It was busy and competitive but not stressful.
good,Decent place to work with good benefits. Management was transparent with the strategy and supported employees to get the job done. Very conservative work environment.
good,"The company is all about taking care of their clients which is something I liked.  They definitely care about their clients' experiences and well being.  The desire to make a difference in the communities in which they do business also appealed to me."
good,"great culture, focus is on the client and helping them to achieve financial well being. employee development and training is a strong focus for this organization."
good,"This most enjoyable part of my job is that I'm able to work remotely three days a week.  The company is really big on creating a balanced Work Life for its teammates."
good,"Overall, I enjoy working at SunTrust. People are focused on common values and principles of the business. The leadership is mostly fair and there is an effort to improve for customers and employees."
good,Great company to be recruited to.  Higher salaries are paid to recruits.  Poor company to advance in.  Pay increases for promotions are lower than competitors.
good,The company is a purpose driven organization. The workplace is pleasant for the most part. Workload can be unpredictable at times which makes it stressful.
good,"I was afforded many opportunities to move around at SunTrust.  Each opportunity, of which I took advantage, was a promotion for me.  I used each position to learn and gain more experience in my field.  I would recommend SunTrust to anyone who is serious about their career and hungry to grow."
good,It wasn't fair for our jobs to be relocated and we would have to apply for them in the new location instead of being offered to be relocated with job( paid relocation by the job). Pay was not great in some position that should have been increased.
good,"A typical day is from 9am-5pm where you are there to help clients with their banking needs and explore areas for them to do better in financially. Areas of lending, accounts and problem solving is important in your role."
good,Work with as many departments as you can and learn all you can.  An employment will never know when their employment will be terminated.  Suntrust has a RIGHT TO WORK clause in their application.
good,"The hardest part of the job, is upselling. You can see that the client is financial strapped and they still want you to suggestively sell products. "
good,Suntrust is a great place to work.  There are many benefits that are offered to the employees and the culture is one that is client focused. I would recommend.
good,"Plenty of new technology and good people in the Buckhead office.  Some organizational issue, no more than most large companies. Employees can work from home 1 - 2 days per week.  Overall fairly relaxed environment that considers family important."
good,"Suntrust was a good bank to work for, while in the mortgage origination department.  They had a new system of origination and processing.  It was supposed to save time and improve inefficiencies.  It did not.  It created more headaches then good.   It's been improved since I left and I'm hopeful it's better."
good,I worked at the lockbox which is not there any longer.  Didn't need experience and it launched me into other opportunities.  Was perfect for my age and where I was in life.  Great benefits back then.
good,"I was there when the company suffered greatly from the Enron scandal. In an attempt to hide the total loss of their investments from stockholders, the Board hired a ""headhunter"" to come in and ""scalp"" operations to show an instant profit."
good,My typical day started with pulling daily reports such as large dollar and overdraft to identify client solutions to save or earn more money for peace of mind for their financial picture. The hardest part of my job was getting the clients to answer the phone. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to save clients money and earn their trust for a long term relationship with me and the bank I was working with.
good,Positive workplace with opportunity to learn the life cycle of loan products. Experience overtime during busy cycles but completely manageable. Good benefits.
good,Working with suntrust they was a very close staff felt like we was family even with dm he seem like he was family although he didn't visit as much but you felt comfortable in you work space
good,SunTrust was my first teller job. I worked part time there.  Gained much teller knowledge through an extensive 2 week training program.  The staff was friendly and hard working.  We all pulled together and helped everyone out.  I had 4 lanes of drive thru which were very busy.  Referrals were stressful but obtainable.  I moved which led to me having to leave the company but I enjoyed my time there.
good,"A typical work day is very task filled with lots of meetings and meeting on top of meetings. "
good,"Very fast paced with expectations of a willingness to adjust to change.  The ability to work from home is a great perk, as well as the 4 week vacation at senior level."
good,My experience with Suntrust was ok. The work environment was unstable though a lot of overturn. I started with no manager which made things difficult for me but once you got the daily ins and outs of the job it was o.k.
good,SunTrust is a less stressful banking job.  There are goals but the pressure isn't overly aggressive and goals can be met with some effort. Clients are mostly friendly.
good,Good work environment and the managers are very helpful. The workplace culture was always pleasant and it was a joy to work there.The hardest part of the job was leaving for the day. They had a great training program and excellent trainers.
good,"My employment at SunTrust was a good experience for me and a culture shock.  Coming from out of state, the culture at SunTrust was totally different from other places I had worked.  The building I worked at was oppressing and most all employees were unhappy."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know my clients, uncovering their needs and assisting them to become financially secure. A typical day a work was fast paced and required multi tasking."
good,working with diverse customers and solving diverse financial issues is eye opening with an opportunity to grow and understand life and finances better
good,The job is good the benefit are good management is good the pay is ok but advancement is not. Despite qualifications you need to be in the company for at least six years to be considered for any new position.
good,"My time a a Financial Advisor was supported by an atmosphere of good values, ethics and support.  I was pleased with the company for the most part.  Somewhat slow to implement change with industry improvements."
good,"I started my career in the banking industry and through multiple acquisitions, it eventually resulted into Suntrust Bank. My experience was very diverse starting from a teller to becoming a VP when I left."
good,SunTrust stands behind its purpose of paving the way to financial well being for its employees and customers. Provides employees with opportunities to find work/life balance and focuses on helping employees become financially confident.
good,Job changes all the time. People are friendly and we all work as a team.  Some managers will work with you to accommodate the needs of your life and family.
good,Good people and good place to work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I would recommend as a good place to work.
good,I work with a wonderful team.  My only quarrel would be there is some obvious favoritism but that's anywhere you go.  I also think for a company this size the benefits are horrible compared to BOA and Capital One which are their competitors. They do have a work from home option to help make up for it but you literally have to beg to use it UNLESS it benefits the company during inclement weather which I also think is a bit unfair. They need to give more vacation and sick time to help create a better work life balance. It makes a huge difference with employees physical and mental health.
good,I have learned a lot from my time and SunTrust and was able to build some wonderful relationships with clients and staff. Helping someone achieve greater financial confidence has been great. The part I enjoy most about my job is to have been able to truly help clients meet their goals.
good,Love the hometown feel of a bank. Love the high clientele. Processes were easy and it was very enjoyable. Great place to work if you are down for the challenge.
good,"In learn new thins when i face any bug in my project and management is very supportive, my co-workers are very friendly we work all together"
good,Great employees and management. Company tries to keep it fresh and keep employees happy with little perks and entertainment. Not a lot of job growth or raises. The salary is low.
good,Working at SunTrust Bank was a great experience that helped me understand my business classes at the University of Memphis. I worked as a teller for almost two years before my position was eliminated and I experienced being laid off.
good,Nice place to work and constant changing and they are always looking for ways to reduce cost. The Managers are all doing more in their areas to try and assist.
good,"Working in the Treasury Management Department is a fun place to work.  The department that I work with is made up of about 10 teammates.  We work well together and have come to this team from different areas in banking.  With the team being made up with  teammates from different areas,  it is great to be able to ask for their help to see if something was missed or not."
good,Work life balance is great but opportunity for advancement and compensation is not competitive.  No African Americans in upper management.
good,"Enjoyed working there. Very good environment. My contract was originally for 3 months, but worked for (extended) to 12 months +."
good,Good and upcoming company. If only they will stop thinking like a big NY firm because they do not like to spend money on needed items.
good,Sales Sales Sales if you like sales this is the company to work for. Very sales driven company. Following in the foot steps of Bank of America.
good,Was a really great place to work before SunTrust.  Now just another big bank that doesn't really care about it's employees.
good,Some days  we were extremely slow at work and others it was non stop . I learned the importance of being organized and time management helped me personally  and the clients. The hardest part of my job would be not able to help the client with their needs . The most rewarding part of my job was building rapport with the clients and being able to help them achieve their financial goals.
good,its just a bank nothing extraordinary but not horrible. Benefits could be a little better along with the incentive. They truly care about clients
good,I enjoy my daily tasks at work. I love my co-workers.I dislike the fact that the company does not always offer the best for our clients. I think other banks offer more. The job can be stressful at busy times but I enjoy it.
good,"The schedules changed drastically every few months which could make things difficult. (It could fluctuate from 4am-11pm, 7 days a week). I met some great people there and enjoyed helping the customers."
good,We worked as a team and everyone was always willing to assist each other to get the job done.  We would put together team challenges and award the winning teams with great prizes and events.
good,At SunTrust I worked with many amazing people. I learned how to better adapt to change in a work environment. The hardest part of the job was constantly being on the phone. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping clients.
good,Great job could pay more. Goals are kinda high and they go up every other month number numbers numbers. I didnt really want to right this but they made me lol
good,"Loved my first manager , he was great . learned a lot about banking had a great ABM who taught us (all) a lot of banking rulers & policys"
good,"The banking management gave you an opportunity for growth and advancement. They were changing their focus on sales goals the last 2 years that I worked there. It was hard to keep the balance between completing your tasks and meeting the sales goals. Most of the time the goals were met. "
good,"alot of management changes, not much promotion from within"
good,Many educational opportunities are made available to employees interested in pursuing them. SunTrust could be better at encouragement/establishment of internal mentor programs.
good,"- Cliche answer: there is no typical day in investment banking. You can do everything / anything from creating profiles to advanced financial modeling, diligence calls, data room management, data sorting / compilation, professional presentation, etc."
good,Working here in the Mortgage domain was interesting and the team members made it interesting and easy to understand the complex module details.
good,"Strong work environment, extensive communication between management and teammates and different lines of business. Very structured and opportunities for growth. Learned different aspects of the business, engaged in seminars and team meetings while presenting goals and overall reviews. Monitoring a group to ensure all guidelines are adhered to and no errors are submitted by specialists prior to execution.Great working relationship with management and working toward meeting monthly goals.All jobs face different challenges and they allow you to grow and sustain knowledge as everything is a learning process that can assist you within your long term goals and or career path.I enjoyed working with a team, assisting others when needed and expanding my knowledge in the process."
good,"learning to full engage clients in meaningful conversations, helping clients find the best product for their specific needs, not product pushing. Working closely with managements and team members to further our sales and services"
good,My company is cutting edge on technology and diversity among teammates.  A typical work day is fast pace with a team which has become nimble and more efficient and productive.  Management has the focus of a one team vision and really cares about finical well being of their teammates.  My co-worker have a best friend outlook and very knowledgable of their duties and roles.
good,"good....enjoyed a lot..."
good,The banking industry is more of retail environment with sales goals that can be stressful to meet at times.  The compensation and benefits are pros but the stress levels can high at times.
good,I worked hard and feel I was recognized by my area manager and moved up quickly. I only left because I became teamed up with a new manager with emotional issues who was also lazy. Lots of continuous training and development. Some coaching questions required in the box answers instead of inspiring innovation. I learned a lot and am grateful for the opportunity to have been part of the management team.
good,"Having worked in a number of different departments, I was able to see how the inner workings of banking were processed.  In the beginning of my ""journey"" I was able to work on all shifts of the Operations center.  When becoming a Client Services representative, I found those experiences were a great resource for assisting the Corporate clientele.  I assisted our Product Management with the development of client training packages and conducted numerous sessions of offsite personal training for the same.  This was done at the same time I was handling my existing duties of Corporate Client Services Specialist.  When I became a Bank Officer, I was dealing specifically with our Healthcare clients.  This was how I became associated with the team at HCA and decided to move on with my career in Cash Management."
good,"The company was great to work for, stood behind its employees, was a little taken back when they disbanded our unit in Orlando."
good,"Great company to work for, but the home preservation department has gone downhill since opening in October 2011"
good,Good company for career advancement. Since I became part of the SunTrust Family I have had mentors who has been very helpful with my Career at SunTrust.
good,"Being with the company for 18 years, I have had many wonderful opportunities to grow, learn and lead others."
good,I enjoy working at SunTrust... I currently process mortgage loan applications.  I enjoy the customer contact on a daily basis.
good,"Ensured compliance with all internal controls"
good,"Everyday provided new and interesting challenges to not only keep up with the ever increasing workflow but to stay on top of new laws, programs, policies, and procedures.  Unquestionably, the most difficult part of my job was working through the risk managment and foreclosure of SFR.  Maintaining the risk exposure of the bank but also curing the loan when possible became the most rewarding."
good,Typical mortgage underwriting workplace.  Enjoyed learning the correspondent side of things.
good,"A typical day is answering the phones, if they ring. You may get two calls over a few days. Not much administrative work to do. Alot of my day consist of assigning myself trainings to acquire more knowledge. "
good,"I enjoyed the clients & the job as a client service specialist.  However, the management was not very good and they make you wait one year before advancement."
good,"This is where I gained my most knowledge in the mortgage industry from Cashiering, to the default area to managing a team of 25."
good,Suntrust provided excellent training and was a great company to work for.
good,The job security level and opportunity for advancement has decreased drastically over the last year.
good,"I will start off by saying that 95% of my days have been extremely busy and I enjoy every minute of it. My work is very fast past that continues from day to day. My goal is to finish all work to start the next morning fresh.  I have learned alot about myself including strengths and weaknesses. I have learned how to use time management very well and what is expected of me from day to day.  I get along with all co-workers whether they like me or not. I am friendly but very responsible and dependable.  I am not picking a hard part of my job because I have learned that I love challenges.  The most enjoyable part is the challenge because it makes me think of all the weekends I spent doing homework, writing papers, quizzes and taking exams.  I cried, prayed, suffered some anxiety and put my big girl pants on and went straight forth with this goal. I did not stop until I was finished and graduated.  "
good,I enjoyed working with customers and helping them with their financial issues. Bringing in new accounts. Customer Service.
good,"Working with this company has given me an opportunity to work on the other side of the retail banking division but this position can at times be stressful if you have exhausted your options to make your sales goals."
good,when I was there I loved it. it was a fun atmosphere and a decent pay wage. if you were a bartender it was great you always had money in your pocket because we were busy every night of the weak.
good,"Well my typical day at work started doing our opening procedures in the mornings; before we open it will be a 15minutes huddle to plan our day. I used outlook to write remainders, schedule meeting and receive e-mails. Customer service has been one of my favorite things; I like to discover their needs, I had good co-workers, we always make the day productive and fun workplace to be. Management wise always there for my tellers learn how ones on ones on them, reviews and also mystery shopper do.

good,"As an Underwriter I am the first person to look at an application once submitted from the branch. I make the initial decision on the application  and then move it forward to hopefully be approved. I learned a lot at this job including patience, teamwork, accountability, precision, and adaptability. Policy and procedures are always changing and you have to be able to adapt quickly or you can fall behind. The hardest part of the job is not having the complete information needed to make a decision and at the same time not wanting to give a bad client experience. With all the moving parts of the loan process its hard to make everyone happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is giving someone that financial confidence they need to live a better life."

Teammates are focused on achieving a well-balanced advancement of tools and resources for clients to reach their financial goals.  They believe in the mission and values of the company.
good,"Flexible time"
good,My branch manager is the best manager I’ve ever had. They encourage you to move up. Bonus is pretty nice. You do have goals that they expect you to make and you do have to make calls daily. Operations side changes frequently.
good,Job wasn’t busy too often but when it was it was met with a good team effort and they were very helpful in my advancement at the workplace. Great place to work.
good,Overall the job is great but some clients make the job hard. Collections is what it is but some customers get irate when they’re called for clearly being past due . If you have tough skin you will have success here

good,"Have a great boss so work life in generally good."
good,"Long time ago but I remember it gave me room to advance at a short pace. I enjoyed working at Sun Trust, the hardest part was making sales but rewarding. I enjoyed promotional times because it gave one the opportunity to sell bank products easily."
good,Working at Sun Trust Bank was a good experience. I left because of a greater opportunity at Guaranty Bank. Sun Trust Bank gave me an opportunity to grow and learn.
good,"My review for the time I worked at SunTrust Banks would be difficult to provide, as I worked there ever so long ago, anything I would write would be antiquated and would not be helpful. Thank you for asking!"

good,SunTrust laid the processing foundation for me to move forward and become an underwriter.  Their salary was fair for the job I performed and help was always available.
good,A trustworthy company. A good place to work and retire from with very good benefits. A good company that encourages  work life balance. Offers fair pay and opportunities for advancement.
good,"SunTrust is a great place to work and my fellow employees are top notch and well qualified. I am not sure why my position was eliminated. I am hopeful that I can find a new position within the company, but I have to be open to other options to take care of my family."
good,"Overall working for Suntrust bank was a very great experience. Depending on the department, there were times where I wondered when I would get a call informing me that I was being laid off. During my time as an employee, there were several layoffs in the consumer lending department. Unless you relocate to corporate headquarters, there are not many good jobs available in the consumer lending sales center. The bank is becoming more sleeker as they're integrating more automated services."
good,"I feel this position is great for students just graduating from high school or in their first or second year in college, or even a part time. Hours are structured they have flexibility to work in a traditional or in store branch (hours vary). We also have access to discounts on amusement parks hotels rental car gifts etc through our company website."
good,SunTrust is great company to work for. The people in the company are great easy to work with and always willing to help. Only downfall with the company is that they’re always laying off.
good,"Received trouble tickets, contacted the user to find a resolution either remotely or desk side. Re-imaging and repair of desktop and laptop PC's and phone systems."
good,"Came in, review email, attend daily status meetings, analyze loan data coming in for new and existing loans to ensure quality. Ensure loans were inputted into all applicable systems."
good,SunTrust was an excellent employer. My need for less hours took me away from my position as Assistant Branch Manager. Benefits and salary were very competitive with the opportunity to earn commission.
good,My team worked well together but I need to be able to advance in my career. The company is supportive of continuing education but it is still very hard to move up.
good,"Handle all transactions for the day."
good,I enjoyed my time with SunTrust and the opportunity that I was given there. As with any job there were challenges that we worked through as a team. I learned how to work in a fast pace environment and how to better work well with a large team. The hardest part of the job would have had to been working with the turnover rate. What I enjoyed most were the Tellers that I worked with and how we would work together to get things done efficiently.
good,I honestly really enjoyed my work experience at suntrust.  Effort is clearly made by management to ensure that the employees are happy working there.  There's always little interdepartmental contests going on to promote a healthy and happy work environment.
good,"I worked for over two years here as a collector. With a weird schedule 11am to 9pm. With an hour lunch and two 15 min breaks throughout the day.  After being there for a year you can apply to a different department. Therefore the schedules change too.  In collections that’s about it with the schedules just choose the days.  Closed on Sundays now. They offer all the benefits, you get Two weeks vacation after your 90days. Paid inclement weather days too. Collections does have mandatory overtime that vary from 0-5 ot max weekly. Its hard to balance life and work like that.  It can be stressful sometimes because your monitored in you computer at all times. There’s not much time to be wasting. But if you do your job right, your not running any risks of getting fired."
good,I love my job and what I do.  I also love working with my manager.  She is the best manager I have ever had the pleasure of working with.  I will greatly miss her but do hope to cross paths with her again soon.
good,Open the branch and hold morning sales meetings with the staff. I learned to be flexible and listen completely before talking. Patience is important. While working in teh Luray Branch the Manager was great when transferred elsewhere I felt that Manager was lacking. I loved wotrking hard and meeting and exceeding my goals. I loved my clients and loved saving them time and money with their banking needs.
good,SunTrust is a fair company to work for. they offer a Variety of benefits to employees and make sure you can take them right away. Sometimes the management gets too caught up looking at just numbers and not the actual situation.
good,"I held many different jobs during my career here, and in each of them except one I had outstanding leaders who knew how to motivate and reward.  These leaders were all in the consumer arena.  Unfortunately I ventured over into Mortgage and had I known this side of be business lays off more frequently than not, I would have stayed in consumer or moved over to commercial which I am aware is equally stable. Co-workers here were also great, the work was busy but not break neck and allowed for good home life work balance."
good,"Overall, SunTrust has been a great employer. I have maximized my education while earning a living. This is a great company where you can evolve as a person while conducting a good work/life balance."
good,SunTrust is a very large company with both good and bad points. The compensation and stability is great. The work can be very boring however so be prepared for this.
good,Got a challenging project (key initiative program from bank) with stringent timelines and budget which needs meticulous planning and tracking things to closure for the successful delivery of the program.
good,Worked for SunTrust Bank for over 11years. It is a great company to work for and the hours are great for a working mom but the sales goals are ridiculous and stressful.
good,A great place to work with job stability.  I would most likely still be working there if my position had not transferred to RidgeWorth.  A learned a lot there.
good,"- Strong commitment to community development"
good,Team environment was great. I had many opportunities to assist teammates in developing their professional careers. For most of my time at SunTrust I was mostly self-directed and management displayed confidence in my leadership.
good,"On a typical day, I spent my time providing guidance and leadership to the project team as we developed and delivered various types of HR, Compliance, technical, and new hire training for SunTrust."
good,Going to work was a pleasure at SunTrust..  People were very friendly and knowledgeable.  Management was interested in your success and pushed you to achieve at your highest level.  As has been most jobs in my life this was a commission sales position and ensuring that we provided the best possible experience for the customer was job one in this sales organization.

good,For the most part I enjoyed my employment at SunTrust.  It gave me a chance to expand my Customer Service skills and learn new things.  I especially enjoyed meeting new people.
good,I was new to the United states and new to this kind of working environment. It was intense but fruitful. This job pushes me to go back to school and obtain an accounting degree.
good,"Worked in their international division, had long days and the compensation did not reflect the work that was expected. Offices were nice and great people."
good,"Manage a staff of 15 technicians that support approximately 3000 end users in the Capital Markets and Investment Banking division, responsible for more than 60% of the company's revenue. Provide support for 14 remote offices in the US, including corporate headquarters in Atlanta, Ga. Responsible for internal technical support including but not limited to laptop & desktop; hardware or software, telecommunications (VOIP), and network support. Manage over 4000 incidents per month."
good,"In general, the company invests in good work/life balance and keeping their employees in good health. The down side, there is drive to keep existing employees. Existing employees, looking to grow their career are given pay increases of less than 10% when accepting promotions...outside hires are given pay rates much hire for the same position."
good,"When I worked at Suntrust my supervisor was my mentor. I learned a lot from him. He taught me the many ways of work ethic and he cared. I enjoyed working with the group of ladies also. They were awesome, and fun to be around."
good,SunTrust is a great place to work.  I is a challenging and competitive environment.  Management is hit or miss.  There are many great managers and then some that lack overall leadership.
good,"Day to day work in a retail location was pleasant.  If you enjoy working with people and are a self motivated responsible person, this company will appeal to you.  Retail positions are not as plentiful as in the past due to changes in how the industry does business.  Expect to be crosstrained."
good,A fair place to work as long as you hit all your numbers. The technology has to improve. The culture comes down to your team the hardest part is finding the right people for the job.
good,"The days at work are busy, and there is always new  regulation implemented therefore we have a learning portal where monthly several updated courses for Compliance and Regulations are required to be completed."
good,They have given the ability of moving through out the company. The immediate supervisors aware of their teams and moved them with raises. They always kept the employees up to date with the updates that were coming up.

good,"With the right balance of people, I found working at SunTrust was very nice.  I looked forward to going to work.  Not many people get to say that about their job."
good,Lots of telephone communication with third party vendors/clients and legal counsel.  Learned an enormous amount in a short period of time.  Co-workers are wonderful to work with.  Deadlines with numerous contracts back to back was the toughest part.  But not impossible.  Accomplishing your scheduled goals and spending time with co-workers was very enjoyable
good,"Great employer overall, though the hours can be long and the job tasks thankless.  Some locations have less manpower than others, thus creating more difficult working conditions, so look around the store and talk to associates prior to applying."
good,"Being a bank teller is really cool and fun, its not over-whelming at all. They only bad part is if your hours get cut back, it takes a while to get into a full-time position. However they pay well, and you get paid holidays off. The Sales part is what might over work you sometimes"
good,I loved my job because I knew what I was doing and I got the job done.  I learned a lot about banking and Corporate Leasing while working at SunTrust.  I feel like management did not go beyond and above for my benefit in SunTrust Leasing and that was the hardest part of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was feeling good once it was done and I can get paid for it.
good,"Overall the work experience was favorable.  Although there were several reorganizations internally due to several new managers of the company, the success continued."
good,"I would greet clients as they walked in or over the phones. I would take a look at their accounts if there was an issue or thought there was a opportunity to improve their financial well-being. I would do deposits, withdrawals, make payments on their loans and credit cards. I would balance my drawer at the end of the shift. Go over any paperwork that may need to be sent to back office or management. Make sure to lock up the branch before leaving if I was the night teller."

good,I work here only i like my manager its difficult like any bank to work i love my job thought but i still like to find something different
good,Co-workers are dedicated and hard workers.  Salary increases are not consistent throughout the company.  Some leaders or mangers are very hypocritical.
good,"I had a great experience working there.  I was able to help build, manage and team of PM's.  The people across the company are very eager and knowledgeable."
good,"Great company to work for. Needs to fine tune the measurement of success in the sales delivery model, but otherwise a great employer. Culture has migrated towards product pushing versus true meeting client needs."

good,Great place to work but the culture needs to more flexible and welcoming to process changes/efficiencies.

good,I would like to be myself productive and I feel happy when I complete the task with the job Stratification.
good,"The environment was very friendly and enjoyable. Management was caring and thoughtful about the needs of employees. The benefits were not great but they sufficed for my needs.

good,people are great to work with; compensation is good; good balance of work and life
good,"I was a Residential Lending Specialist."
good,"yup, it was a good company, great pay but killer goals. Have ejoyed it but not passionate, no spark"
good,"I enjoy what I do, I love to help people make the best of their lives.  I wish they would focus on their customers needs and not necessarily the numbers of referrals, etc.. It takes away from the personal feel.  It's all about sales and referrals."
good,My days at productive by staying busy all day everyday.  I've learned to keep the customer involved every step of the loan process where I have not kept the customer in the loop in the past mortgage banking position.
good,"Great environment until they decided to go to a matrixed job pooling then they put managers unfamiliar to the actual job and made it specific to the role, like BA and PM roles instead of the system environment.  Good work life balance until jobs were replaced with offshore resources and people lost their jobs."
good,"great coworkers, constantly changing upper management created sense of uncertainty"
good,"A typical day at work would be to converse about deals and potential clients with staff. Learning everything from administrative work to retail banking to the in's and out's of an entire loan as well as commercial and wealth investments. Management was minimal but efficient. Co-workers were the best part of this job. The job was mostly enjoyable, not complaints."

good,"Folks stay at ST for 20-30 years, which is good in a way, but it means that newer people do not have many opportunities for advancement.  I have been fortunate to have fantastic managers that have allowed flex time.  However this is not the norm.  My teammates over the years have been knowledgeable and fun to work with, but such an environment is now difficult to find here.  Technology at ST is antiquated and they do not update to newer systems often"
good,"Typical day consisted of meeting with existing and potential clients to help them understand investment planning and goals. I learned a great deal about building rapport and relationship based selling. Everybody at the branch was very close and we even hung out outside of work. To this day it was the most enjoyable job I've had. The hardest part of the job was the pressure put on you by management. It was tough, but for me, high pressure situations always bring out the competitor in me. The most enjoyable part of that job was the clients and the book of business I created and cultivated. I really enjoyed getting to know the clients not just on business level, but also a personal level."
good,"Very stressful environment to work in, i learned different areas of the mortgage business.  Management did not allow enough training to do my job. Liked my co-workers and still keep in touch with some of them.  The hardest part of the job was the training, i told my manager that i never did closings and if i could have more training and she said no. The most enjoyable part of the job of final docs was the co-workers and knowing the work, closings was not too enjoyable, probably the most enjoyable was an hour lunch and the co-workers."

good,Enjoy working for the company. Suntrust provides excellent training for new hires.
good,"working enviroment with other tellers was ok, sells not to favorable."

good,"Suntrust Mortgage is focused on providing en exceptional experience to the customer throughout the life of the loan including but not limited to customer service interactions, flexible and advanced communication tools, and alternative financial solutions. Since joining the company I have learned how to be a more effective leader and I have built great working relationships with my coworkers. A typical day involves reviewing legal documents for execution, working with foreclosure processors to resolve any issues with the legal documents and maintaining a productive environment which allows us to meet our daily goals. The hardest part of my job would be balancing how to properly execute documents where states and localities contantly change rules and procedures. I enjoy my job because I feel that I am helping homeowner's through the most difficult part of their lives so that they can move on with obtaining a more secure financial future."
good,This was one of the best jobs I have ever experienced. It was a very fast pace job and we were growing extremely fast.
good,"Very progressive benefit package, but health insurance is expensive. Learned a lot about AML.Low ceiling."

good,"I learned a lot about the mortgage industry. Everyone in my office was very family oriented and you felt right at home. A typical day was answering the main phone line, helping walk-in customers and helping my co-workers with any problems they had. I also was the Office Manager and the event planner. I ordered all supplies for 3 offices supported the staff in those offices as well. Management in my office was great. I kept my manager's calendar and was his assistant. The hardest part was not being able to help with a problem. My most enjoyable part was just being there with my co-workers."
good,Call center so as long as you are on the phones you are good. When I was there we had some nice kickbacks.
good,"Typical. Answer: Busy, rarely was slow , but after 2012 in the last 3 months they let me go, the work slow down in my former Department."
good,"Although there could be more consistency with policies, the company overall has a pleasant atmosphere and plenty of opportunities for advancement"
good,"Sign on to the computer, start capturing signatures from the newly merged bank customer accounts. Co workers were always willing to lend a hand and answer questions. We had an hour for lunch and 2 15 minute breaks."
good,i enjoyed working for suntrust bank. customers and coworkers were a joy to work with and for
good,"There are only two types of days you can have a bank a fast day or a slow day. You could usually tell which you'd have about and hr or so into work. You spend your day trying to gauge the needs of your clients with the products you sold while balancing a cash drawer. Not the hardest but not the easiest thing to due it you have an endless line of customers. You have to either have patience in abundance to do this job or it will be something you are forced to learn. You really can't do this job unless you have good co-workers, and you'll find that one of the hardest part of this job is not working as a team. As soon as you get away from the team mentality in a bank that's when you get slammed. You definitely don't wont to burn bridges with a teller. I my opinion Holidays were the best part of the job. You just never know how much people appreciate you handling their money until X-Mas comes around and you get an envelop with something for you in it, or tickets to your local professional football teams game."
good,"Great company to work for. Management teammates great, but pay is low."
good,Work in several different departments as an administrative assistant.
good,I have learned great management skills during my tenure. The hardest part of the job the training materials available.

good,SunTrust now Truist is a good company t work for.   They have good benefits and have a of programs for employees.   I would recommend this company to a friend .
good,"A great place to work if you're just getting your career started, or if you have tons of experience. Compensation is decent, and learn a lot of new information."
good,"Typical day will be cold calls, coaching teammates, and making sure the branch is operationally sound. The hardest part of the job is reaching your goals, as the ABM you have the highest goal in the branch."
good,"Management is very good. Pay is not great, but very good benefits.                       "
good,"highly motivated team environment on demanding and trend-setting assignments with a great deal of scope for your ideas. Great place to work offers the most in-depth employer reviews on the list. While GlassDoor offers individual employee feedback, great place to work’s employer"

good,"Work here was always left here. Once you walk in the door, you have a job to do, but it never followed me home. Work-life balance was easily attainable. Management was supportive when needed. Only drawback was the push to 'sell' products from the front-line."

There were also administrative duties but there was a support team to aid with that. I learned that having a proper order and a structured process will help the sales process flow smoothly from start to finish. I learned to think outside the box in order to develop a lead source and manage everyone around me to the common goal of closing loans. Management and co-workers were very bought in to the sales support process. This made obtaining sales and leads the sales reps biggest focus, which tuened into a sink or swim environment. "

Recently they have really focused on selling products and services so do not apply there unless you are used to goals and being held accountable for meeting those goals. Great clientele in the areas I was in!
good,"A typical day at work consists of getting referrals from the clients that enter the branch. You need to exceed goals every month (10 for part-time, 20 for full time) and if you don't, the managers will constantly breath down your back about it. I've learned that banking is another form of retail. Its all about selling a product, even if you don't believe in it"
good,"Suntrust Bank was a great company to work for.  A busy and challenging workplace that allowed one to work freely.  Coworkers were supportive in the beginning when there was somewhat of a learning curve.  Immediate supervisors took the time to make sure you were up to par with company and federal guidelines.  Daily requirements of making your quotas as well as quality standards taught us time management and what to focus on and what not to focus on as much.  Figuring out what was most important in the Suntrust process of Loan Review was somewhat difficult and different from what I had previously done but management arranged meetings and emphasized in detail what needed to be done.  I found that the support of my teammates was most enjoyable.  We worked well together for instance when a question arose as to how a certain process was to be carried the more experienced teammates would make suggestions and then we would research the process and see if that was correct.  My experience with Suntrust was an enjoyable one.  One that I would hope to be given a chance to repeat, this time permanently."

The comapny expects more work from each person than I have ever seen but is filled with genuinely caring people. It is nice to be part of such a productive team.
good,"Good place to work for. SunTrust is like other big bank. There are sales and service involve. Teller work, most branches have no long lines."
good,"Suntrust was a nice place to work in. As with most bank jobs, there are goals that they want you to meet, and this will involve cold calls, rehearsing and using scripted sales pitches on customers via phone and in person. The idea is to get customers to do MORE than just keep their money with the bank. They want customers to take advantage of HELOC, car loans, credit cards and more. Weekly meetings to try and encourage you to do more/be better, can sometimes feel childish however if you put your nose down and JUST DO IT, you can be quite successful here. The ability to get along with your teammates will help pass the time when business is slow."
good,Great place to work for as a new or young professional banker and experienced banker as well. The flexibility at work was nice with nice parking lots for the employees.
good,I left SunTrust pre-merger to BB&T. The bank was run on a customer first directive. That changes when the efficiency ration became the most important thing. I can't speak to the culture now.
good,"Company is great! With the merger with BB and T the benefits are unbeatable. The work is fine but can be very boring and same old thing everyday. Management is great at branch level and i worked for great Executive leadership as well. Not ""salesy"" like other banks."

good,I would go back to SunTrust if my career as a Realtor fails. They are very client based and have a lot of support for their teammates. The culture in itself is what kept me there so long.
good,I enjoyed my employment with Suntrust Bank.  I enjoyed so much working with my teller coordinator.  Staff and tellers that I worked with on a part time basis super helpful.  Great teamwork.
good,"It's nice to have a good relationship with the coworkers, including management.  The Branch was small so the opportunity was there to really know your customers."
good,"SunTrust is a wonderful place to work. The leadership really cares and listens to the employees."
good,Great company to work for I would recommend applying but negotiate pay when you come here. Like every job there are pros and cons however the work-life balance that SunTrust offers makes it nice.
good,"It is a good place to learn about banking. I had some good experiences and helped good people handle their finances. It can be customer service oriented depending on what position. I was a financial service rep for the in store department in a Kroger. The sales environment can be manageable. I did not feel stressed very often to hit my goals, but when I did achieve my goals the rewards were adequate.  All in all I would recommend working for them, my life has improved since I started here."
good,"People were very friendly, but the call volume is crazy because they don't have enough help. Unless you love the call center environment this is not the job for you."
good,"Great work environment; believes in providing internal training for the staff, provides a flexible work schedule for most employees, has a great presence in the community with their volunteer efforts."
good,"They give your opportunities to grow within company. I work as a Sales Representative with aggressive sales goals, but the support that's given is amazing as well as the training."

We spent our time working with each other, assisting, answering questions,and or concerns when the needs arose. We had monthly team celebrations, and quarterly celebrations.The manager assisted the team in anyway she could. Everyone felt like we could go to her for assistance, when ever we.needed The hardest part of the job was accepting the fact that the job was going to be eliminated. The most enjoyable part was, being able to do our work and have fun with your teammates each day."
good,Relaxed but poor above management. Chose good people for the teams and was always happy with the hours and pay. Would recommend this job to a lot of people.
good,"Positive work environment, fun place to learn, and develop skills for career advancement.  Provides proper training to alllow customer relationships to gain  trust and deepen"

good,Alot of opportunity but many offices are consolidating to the main headquarters in Atlanta.  Customer services roles have moved overseas. Excellent technology and remote working environment
good,"For over a year I worked with an unethical manager, Hours are very inconsistent and done a month in advance so a higher manager can approve it for a branch they have never been to. There is too much product pushing which has upset many clients cause verbal altercations with teammates, very sales driven,"
good,"Recommends"
good,Great place to work with flex schedules and telecommuting opportunities.  Very relaxed working environment with a lot of fun and educational activities.
good,"SunTrust was extremely competitive and sales oriented. It seemed to be following some aspects of the Wells Fargo business model. Overall, I enjoyed working there, but left because of a lack of career advancement opportunities. Opportunities for advancement seemed to be easier for the male employees."

good,It was stressful at times knowing that you were responsible for a large amount of money as well as ensuring the proper care was followed in handling money.
good,Working in the call center as a Manager was always interesting. I worked on projects. I had a team of 7 sales representative that were on the phone selling all the products the bank offered.

good,"Suntrust is a great place to work at.  It is a company that values its teammates and they will invest in their teammates.  "
good,SunTrust is a fine place to work.  They are adding Big Data capabilities.  They are very good at creating processes and procedures so that output from different teams is similar.

good,I was a vendor working for SunTrust Bank. The company banking system was converting to new database and software. And I assisted them for this process.

good,Dedicated and hard-working employees working as a team within the different financial departments.  Always encouraging one another with more business opportunities .
good,"I learned a lot of different things about money and checks and how to recognise real from fake. I learned about different types of accounts and loans and mortgages. Overall, working at SunTrust was exciting."
good,"I had a lot of fun working there. Overall it is a great place and a nice place to start your banking career. You can get a lot of training (don't forget to remind your management that you if need one to schedule) I was able to learn so many things how to be a good Teller and execute with excellence. Some day are slow and sometimes you can get slammed. Some branches require full staffing but somehow there is always someone missing (managers work for two branches or some other employees have to come and help very often). Sales goal is a big thing, and it can be very stressful. While I was there the goals were unreasonably high. Now they've slightly change the system so I hope employees will be a little bit happier about this."
good,"Very comparable to banks it's size.  Great work life balance.  However, benefits increased in price dramatically year after year.  Limited career advancement in Nashville area."
good,I enjoyed working at SunTrust. My peers and boss was really cool. If i didnt have to relocate would have never quit SunTrust. I still miss working there.
good,"Provides administrative support to assigned area such as, answering telephone, directing visitors, staff,  Ascertain reason for visit and announce all visitors before asking them to wait in the waiting area for their escort."
good,"It's a stressful job but with a chance for advancement. That does cause a lot of turnover on the teller line. The branches are staffed minimally and if someone is out it's tough to work. There's no relief help. If you're good at sales and calling to make sales, this is a great place to work. That's a very important part of your job. Great commissions for actively aggressive sales people."
good,"Suntrust was a great place to work and very fair in its promotion hierarchy."
good,In the beginning things were great. Everybody worked as a team. The bank then sold the credit card processing to First data. The management that took over were not that great. It became a back stabbing type of environment.
good,I feel that SunTrust was one of the best companies Ive worked for. I loved the people and what they stand for. I don't think they have a good work life balance tho
good,"Suntrust is a nice place to work, pay is good fast pace environment, workplace culture was good got along well with others.  The management was very approachable with need or issue"

good,"Overall it was an nice environment. My job entailed answering, phones, faxing and mail outs. I opened up the office and closed it when the days where not busy"
good,"In the morning we come in and at our start time we must be logged into the phone. The goal for each call was to take care of the customer's needs while providing excellent quality customer service in 120 seconds or less. Unfortunately I was never quite able to meet this goal, however I more that made up for it in sales, quality monitoring, and attendance. This was a very fast-paced environment and many days we had contests with small rewards for excelling in certain categories. This job had a great work environment but in the end it was fairly easy to burn out due to the tedious nature of the job."
good,"I learned a lot working about mortgages and the loan process by working at SunTrust Bank Mortgage. My daily routine consisted of running reports to show interest rates, answering phone, greeting customers, filing, obtaining signatures, and to do training to become a loan officer."
good,Suntrust is a great company that is growing with the times. I learned many different things and held many different jobs withing the company. They allow you to grow and new jobs.
good,I worked for a much bigger national bank for years and in a fast paced big city so it is hard to compare my experience with SunTrust to my previous experience. The technology is outdated and the processes are old but it works for here. There are things that could be improved but what company doesn't have areas for improvement. Overall it's been a good experience so far.
good,A great group of Professionals to work with. A typical day can be very demanding in finding solutions to challenges and solving problems.  You learn the value of teamwork and building relationships across LOBs.
good,"There is job security and good benefits and good compensation. Depending on your department and/ or manager, things can seem unorganized and unclear as to what is your actual role within the company."
good,Company has really high goals that are really impossible to reach. A lot of micromanagement. They have recently lower the goals but still a ridiculous amount.

good,A great company to work for.  extremely nice and friendly coworkers and management . Hands off management style.  Allowed flex time which helped with commuting

good,"I've learned to grow in a company and to do my best at whatever it is that I am doing. I've grew up with the company and I can say that in that over time with SunTrust I've changed and I'm proud of myself. Starting as just someone who is handling cash to doing everything else in the branch feels good, whether thats operations, coaching, ATM, etc."
good,The team was very easy to work with and willing to help.  There was a good work and life balance and the work was very challenging and rewarding. Good growth potential.
good,"great bank with a strong vision for growth and prosperity. suntrust gives you the tools to grow, learn, and thrive, I reallllllllllllllllllllllllllly liked working here"

good,"Suntrust is very active in the community and great company to work for. Altough sales is really pushed to all employees, the work/life balance is manageable"

good,Great company to work for.  Great training provided to employees.  It was a great work life balance and a fair company to work for.  I learned a lot about the banking industry.
good,"To start my day i make phone calls to prospective as well as current clients to drive business. I take on service requests that are to be handled with in 48 hrs. Also i conduct conversations in order to unveil the needs of the client to recommend the proper solutions. I deal in openings & closings of accounts, entering applications for lending, referring business to our dept partners, teller work while they rotate lunch breaks, I learned to manage my teammates in time of need to maintain good rapport between us & the clients as well as between ourselves in order to remain productive daily. Fill voids in order to maintain a balanced operation (consistent sales production across the board around solutions offered). Friendly & cohesive culture at work. Most difficult part of the job is which is the best part of the job for me is making a disgruntled client happy & turning service into sales as well."

good,I loved the challenges working in the drive through provided. I worked four ten hour days. I handled the commercial accounts that were dropped off over night. I also handled the regular drive through traffic. Every thing was different. and I loved getting to know the people I waited on.
good,"If you love sales and customer service then banking may be a good option for you. The sales goals are extremely high, growing yearly, but the compensation for the hard work is subpar. The benefits are great and if you meet said goals the quarterly bonuses can be worth it."
good,If you are A bright and sale driven person sun trust is for you. Since these day most bank are become more geared towards retail you are pushed to make sale and be passionate about locking in your clients. Suntrust strive to be a one stop bank the want everything from you credit card to your mortgage. Over all the company as a whole takes great care of there employees they have wonderful benefits and they have a great work life balance. Though if you are looking to get out of retail I advise you not to take this route.
good,Nothing but good things to say about the company. They gave me the opporunity to grow and take on a new challenges all the time. I was able to succeed in many different capacities and they always recognized my accomplishments.  I loved working for a purpose driven organization. This is what set SunTrust apart from other financial instituions. When you are meeting client needs it is rewarding and gives purpose to what we are trying to accomplish.
good,This job was based on bank teller.  Taking and distributing money to customers with savings and checking accounts.  Opening new accounts and money markets.  Balancing transactions and reviewing accounts for further business.
good,I worked here for over 1 year. I learned so much in regards to finance and money. I would definitely recommend working for this company. The staff was friendly and supportive.

good,A typical day would start with the proper procedures for security to enter the bank.  Once inside I would work with another employee to open main vault and bring out cash drawers and items needed to service customers.

good,"Over all it was a great work environment with a great staff / management. A typical day would consist of waiting on clients, processing transaction behind the teller line or assisting them at the desk. The sales goals for SunTrust are very high and demanding . In order to do well in this job you must be comfortable talking to clients in depth about there finances. As a client Service Specialist you spend a majority of your time making phone calls to set appointments to make your goals. There is a lot of coaching a training involved in the role, but if you do not make your goals each month you get bad performance review and your job could be in jeopardy."

I learned to be brave and how to handle stress because of this job, and how to deal with different kind of people and clients.The management is good, gives us what we need specially the materials we need for project presentation. All of my co-workers are my friends,we are fun and happy, were like one family n the group. The Hardest part in the job is sometimes i encounters some arrogant clients. The most enjoyable part of the job is when i deal a client and see them happy with their new house/property and they were contented with me as their Agent assisting them."
good,I was a much better and much more knowledgeable person coming out than I was going in. When I started out SunTrust was a place of learning and family togetherness. I learned to connect with my co-workers in such a way that it was enjoyable to just think of being there each day. The hardest part of the job was not knowing what the next challenge would be because you knew that whatever it would be you were sure to learn a lot. Management was of great support to each employees and encouraged them to gather all the knowledge they could.

Being a part time college student I needed a job that could help me grown and keep me in school. This company has aided me with these functions and has grown my education to the world. Now I am on the horizon of completing school next year and i've been promoted twice on a part time schedule.

The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the constant policy changes, while the most enjoyable part of the job was learning new challenges."
good,Very professional work atmosphere. Willing to cross train.
good,While employed at SunTrust bank typically I would open the branch to start the day. Through out the day I would prospect new and existing customers to create or deepen a the relationship between the customer and the bank. I also creatively marketed products to potential clients to interest them in the best Suntrust product for them. Loan underwritting was also a part of my day while maintaining the safe that I was in charge of.
good,"A typical work day at Sun Trust was very enjoyable. I come to work punch in start processing the work, take a lunch break when I am finished with the first batch of work.

Senior leadership was in the office Monday morning (from Atlanta) to immediately setup grief and other services. Since then the company has continued to put  the well being of its teammates first."
good,"The place is great to work for. The pay is good and at least in the information security department. Now management is whole different story. We currently have a manager by default situation that is killing the team's morale. The company had three choices, they wanted a particular team member as a manager as their first choice, but he refused because he wanted to keep spending time with his family. Then, the second choice was a very technical person who decided he was going to be the manager for two weeks just to try it out and help him make his decision which he immediately refuse after the two weeks. Finally, the position went to the third choice, she is the female version of Hitler."
good,"Branches have goals to achieve and makes the work place competitive. Some team members are cut throat and ""steal"" other team mate's clients/referrals. Competitive workplace created politics. SunTrust is a great employer and takes care of their employees, management is not diplomatic."
good,Good atmosphere with a lot of perks. Great vacation policy (4 weeks) plus plenty of purpose driven volunteer opportunities. Structure of the company may frustrate some but overall I like the time I have spent here and would recommend considering SunTrust as a career.
good,"suntrust is great place to work family environment great team work from team mates, and manger are always willing to help, great info on living an financial well being"
good,Great Management Team and Opportunity for Advancement. Really enjoyed working with my team in Harrisonburg Va and wish I could go back with them. Unfortunately the branch has now closed its doors.
good,"A lot a phone call per minute, teach people how to do good decision about their money. Management always tried to help employees to do better.  Multi-culture, please all customer and follow protocol to do that. Teach people how to get the best of the credit."
good,It was convenient at the time because of federal holidays was the same as school ( I was off the same time as my child).  Great benefits and time off.  You have to be a self starter since there minimal to no training. Its very difficult to get a different position within.
good,Had a great opportunity working for the company but the company closed it doors & moved to Atlanta and I didn’t want to move my location the pay was great and my experience
good,flexability with schedule allowed for a wonderful life/ work balance. Management and team mates were wonderful and supportive of each other. I really enjoyed working on the sales side of mortgages.
good,SunTrust is a good place to work. Management is great and willing to assist when needed. The schedule is flexible which is great for work-life balance. The training needs to be better.
good,"Assigned 24 loans to process a day"
good,"SunTrust delivers it's purpose both with clients as well as with employees.  SunTrust Retail bank is a fair and client-centric company and allows teammates to work autonomously to find the best ways to help their clients.  I have enjoyed working with SunTrust overall.  The only downside is the incentive plan and career advancement.  They are not transparent and incentive plan changes frequently.  Retail bank employees can get ""stuck"" in the retail space with limited options for advancement in other sectors."
good,Working with amazing leadership has been the most enjoyable experience with SunTrust.  I was able to grow professionally and to become an expert in my field.
good,very slow paced and very detailed environment. Made sure all transactions or transfers were accurate as well as complete safe deposit box procedures correctly and accurately daily
good,"Suntrust is large there are different depts with different work styles. Many people have been there for yrs, pay attention and you can learn a lot here."
good,"A typical work day was to come in and review what was left from the morning. Then find out how many boxes was left and what the count was for the night. Break down the boxes according to how many persons on staff for that night. I learn how to use rubber finger to flip through the paperwork faster. Management was present but little to none. The workplace culture was relax but on a time schedule attire was business casual. Hardest part of the job was making sure you went through each sheet of paper not to miss paper clips, staples, or a note and or deed. the most enjoyable part of the job is that we some times did pot lucks, challenges, and team work to make sure we did our part to make it easier for the morning staff."
good,"A great place to work. A great cafateria with good food. Flexible time for lunch. Flexible work hours depending on department. Managers made decisions about vacations, schedules.etc. Learned various real estate accounting and bank owned properties (REO,s) Learned about Student loans and worked with mortgage government agencies (Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, and Freddie Mac), Hardest part of job was some technology was behind. Co workers were very enjoyabe to work with."
good,Old school white shoe firm  - they don't believe in change and are living in the 1980's. I hear from old timers they used to get a pension which I guess was cool
good,Good place to move around and get experience and knowledge lots of great departments and lots of work always never a dull moment sitting in your desk doing your work .
good,"Suntrust overall is a great employer. They offer benefits,pto(paid time off), 401k, and much more for full time employees. Of course with any job the management can be a little funny but I think this is based on the dept and the business needs. I’ve been with this company for going on 2 years and feel as though they have offered me a great deal of knowledge and opportunity to progress in the mortgage default profession. I would only recommend this company to someone who is punctual and has great attendance because not having those qualities will get you out the door very quickly."
good,Sun Trust Bank is a good place to work. Structure and hierarchy make work conducive to meeting corporate demands. Great people to surround ones self with
good,Worked in a variety of assigments for multiple supervisiors and areas of the bank. They were all friendly and professional. The focus was on completing projects on time and on budget. Cost savings was a priority.
good,"I've been working for Suntrust for 5 years and I don't really have anything bad to say. It's a really good company to work for. Typical Day at work for me sometimes can get stressful because of the ever-changing environment that I work in. However, management staff are very helpful and always available to help which makes everything bearable."
good,"Suntrust was a learning experience, competitive customer engaging every day. So it was never a dull moment, employee engagement was good. Its a sales driven company where you have to stay on your toes and be knowledgeable of company's products."
good,Every day you learned something new.  The hardest part was always learning new forms or new computer software.  The best part was the people you work with.
good,not the best but not the worst.. Plenty of benefits but hours are usually fixed. Very short staffed and u can possibly be the only one at a branch. they definitely need help.
good,"I really enjoyed my position, my department relocated to Florida. It was a good environment to work. My supervisor was very pleasant to work with and the pay was really great and you had opportunity for advancement. My computer programming training was very helpful because I work with computer programmers and computer engineers."
good,"They do NOT accept doctors/hospital notes. The only way you can miss work for any medical reason is if you have FMLA. So basically you can't call off even if you were in a hospital, unless you have a disability."
good,Amazing team approach. Team managers are flexible and SunTrust is willing to help you advance your career in whatever direction you see fit. Love this company.
good,"Good company to work for, but it would be better for a better career development program. There is little clarity on when to know the right time to advance."
good,My days working for SunTrust varied but I had a good balance between fast paced and down time. I loved my managers they were helpful and fair. There was nothing about the job I didn't like. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping lead the way for the clients financial well being. I learned a lot with the company and I will go back if I have the chance to.
good,General Teller duties.  Vault Teller duties when Supervisor was on vacation. Directed customers to Customer Service when necessary. Sales goals could sometimes be hefty. Overall enjoyed job. The hardest part of job was handling excessive amounts of coin and the drive thru tubs.
good,"I've enjoyed working at SunTrust, although times can get busy it was a good experience to work there. every employee treated me with respect and showed me new things."
good,"It's a laid back job. They dont pay enough to the duties they would like for you to do. However, you are compensated if you reach your goals. The benefits are greats along with third party deals."
good,SunTrust Bank allowed me to advance quickly due to my desire for learning the banking industry and work ethic. The majority of my managers were very understanding and trusted my abilities. Those attributes are what molded me into becoming a very thorough trainer and listening ear for my co-workers.
good,"A typical day at work is fairly simple. You learn a lot about how to help clients move from financial stress to financial confidence. The hardest part of the job is getting clients to realize there is a need when you have a life event or even saving for many things especially retirement. SO getting them to transition from the teller to a personal banker is challenging especially when it seems as if everyone is on the go. Overcoming the objection of ""I don't have time"" is not as simple as it may seem. The most enjoyable part is being there for the clients."
good,"Although Suntrust is a great company my personal opinion was that it was a little too focused on making numbers instead of caring about there employees or customers. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at SunTrust banks, it was a great way to become integrated into my community and to develop relationships with people from all walks of life."
good,Great Company to learn and gather experience from.  Great Culture and management.  I am currently working in operations not in retail.  Changes occur frequently.  Must be able to adapt.
good,"Lighting the way for financial well-being is the motto of this company and ""client first"" is practiced daily.  I enjoyed the people that I worked with."
good,"I would be responsible for building and maintaining relationships with clients whom old a minimum of 250k in total relationship balances with Suntrust. I would cross-sell products on the banking, lending, and investment side and outbound call to build a growing and  sustainable book of business. My co-workers and team were amazing and helped me in prospecting and relationship building as well. The hardest part of the job was leaving after a miscommunication with a client leading to allegations forcing me to resign for my best interests. I loved helping others find financial stability and defining and prioritizing financial priorities."
good,Great place to work but you have to be a fast learner and you must be able to pick up untold things very fast. The training is 3 days and if you have never been in banking before 3 days is not enough. Not to mention they expect you to know everything even though you were not taught. Also sales is a huge priority
good,Good company. Enjoyed assisting customers with their finances everyday and seeing frequent customers regularly made the day enjoyable.
good,The day was answering the phones while assisting the client with their account. offering them different products that best fit their needs. the coworkers were great got along very well. the hardest part of the job were not being able to help someone. most enjoyable is when you bet off the phone and you know that person was happy because you did everything you could and more.
good,"I was very impressed with the executives at SunTrust.  I had some contact with the CEO, but worked very closely with the Wholesale Banking Executive.   They are genuine guys who are good at what they do and really enjoy it."
good,SunTrust is an awesome company that will promote within. They are very professional and willing to go that extra mile for their employees and customers.
good,"Good Company to work for. Have an opportunity to better your education.  You are able to cross train,  You are require a certain number of hours of class each year."
good,"Working for Suntrust has been challenging yet rewarding at the same time. You have to stay focused and work hard, but in the end it's worth it."
good,"all about sales, no interaction from upper management, a lot is expected of you with low pay"
good,Speaking with the team regarding changes in policies and state to state procedures. Receiving important information from attorney's and paralegal statewide. Meeting with Upper management twice a week regarding team work issues and resolutions.
good,Sometimes can be stressful and understaffed but overall a wonderful place to work and advance in your career
good,"I was a teller supervisor at SunTrust bank, I did the schedule for the work place, assigned tasks for them, training and coaching for all tellers. I had great customer service skills."
good,Suntrust is a great place to work. The work life balance if maintained and also the management is all ears to any innovative ideas you come up with.
good,Good place but beware of offshoring. That is what they do. They send the jobs to India. There are more Indians working there thana are Americans... Cheap labor I guess
good,A typical day at work is assigning the workflow. My management leaves me to make sure all task are completed daily wth little supervison. My co-workers look up to me because they know I will be there to assist. The hardest part of the job is completing the work flow when systems go down. The most enjoyable part of the job is training and teaching co-workers to succeed.
good,"worked with knowledgeable people, excellent benefits and good team chemistry"
good,"Overall, SunTrust is great. Depends on your team and manager."

good,I enjoy my position with Suntrust.  I would like a new position for self-betterment
good,"Suntrust is a great company to work for, but there were a few things that I did not agree with. I started working for Suntust in 2011 in Atlanta Ga. I enjoyed my job, due to my great work performance I was promoted in 4 months, In 2013 I was transferred to DC and it wasn't a great experience. My pay was not adjusted to the cost of living in Dc as agreed upon, they created an incentive plan that made it impossible to get a pay out, and the manager I had was not a honest person. since he had worked for the company for a number of years upper management over looked a lot of misconduct, and some they were unaware of. When I had a conversation with the manager to let him know that there was something's I was not comfortable with then he made my work day hell from then on."
good,"I learned many things while working at SunTrust Bank, most importantly, how to deal with people. Customers have a variety of needs and specific circumstances which often requires specialized solutions. There were often very upset customers who needed a little extra special care and attention in order to resolve their concerns or issues. I quickly learned that it is best to address these concerns or negative issues in a timely manner, rather than putting it off until later. I would have to say the best part of my job at SunTrust Bank was interacting with the clients. I loved helping people and seeing their reactions when they realized their needs have been met efficiently and effectively."
good,Great hours in a relaxed but professional environment with great opportunity to make long lasting relationships with clients.
good,Great company for advancement but the hardest part of the job is dealing with co-workers
good,"I manage a high volume portfolio of commercial loans that are in the closing/documentation stage. I am responsible for adhering to regulatory requirements and internal policies during the loan closing process. I have been on the fast track for learning about different types of lending, collateral, clients, and specialized documentation. I enjoy the multitasking of working with internal teammates and external clients and attorneys on loans in all different stages of the closing process. I specialize in non-profit and tax exempt deals."

good,"I loved working here. This is an awesome company, and I appreciate all that I learned and that I was given a chance to advance based on my experience and education. I knew the fire I had inside and they saw all I gave to SunTrust Bank. This was a company which was mutally beneficial for both the employer and employee."
good,"My days at SunTrust were pretty productive. I learned several things such as how to deal with clients in forclosure, short sales, processing loans, reviewing loans, requesting documents and making welcome calls. Managment was very micro-mananaged and assisted employees if needed. My co-workers were great to work with as well. The hardest part of my job was having to contact a client if their application was denied approval for modfication. The most enjoyable part was being able to work in a field that I love."
good,i worked with very polite people who were very goal orientated
good,"I really enjoyed working at Suntrust Mortgage. I was able to obtain several different positions which taught me about the Mortgage loan system. A typical day here was very busy, fast paced, and challenging. Management was delightful, people of all ranges. My co-workers were work oriented like myself."
good,"Working for this company was amazing. There are tons of advancement opportunities, benefits are amazing, an typically the people you work with are very knowledgable in their field."
good,Worked here for almost 8 years and it is a good company that cares about it employees and customers. Good environment with activities always going on.
good,Suntrust allows you to learn different skills  however you need to be a self motivator   Very little time for training   You do have opportunity for growth but you need to be diligent and go after it  apply yourself and you will be successful
good,Information regarding this position to follow after completing the survey.  No additional information to provide at this time.  Will provide additional details later
good,I loved working here. Unfortunately management felt it best to lay off everyone and move the files to their headquarters. It was one of the best jobs I’ve had.
good,Since I have started with SunTrust my experience has been excellent. They genuinely care for their employees well-being and development. My manager takes time to properly coach and monitor teammates and talks about career advancement regularly.
good,"internal advancement opportunities, excellent salaries and benefits. really great employees to work with. Approachable management with personal flexibility."
good,"I love working for SunTrust. I feel comfortable and appreciated, but having started in Retail and worked my way up through the company. I have fallen victim to the “internal candidate” syndrome. Every promotion or new job opportunity is capped at a 5% salary increase, simply because you’re internal. Do I think this happens the higher you go? No. Has it been a deterrent for me to advance in the company without fear of battling for a deserving salary? Yes."
good,"Uncover clients financial needs, make recommendations for products that would fit. Develop a relationship with new clients as well as existing clients."
good,"Great stepping stone into retail banking. The training courses were interactive and helped me to understand my role. The company takes time to listen to employee's needs, frustrations, and makes improvements."
good,Very fast pace and stressful.  Good benefits and pay.  Attendance guidelines to strict and to much put on the length of each call.  Also did not like selling bank products.
good,Suntrust has a great learning culture but also expects you to be a quick learner. There is room for advancement in the branch setting but there are no bank operations departments in Charlotte.
good,Good place to start a career as you get to learn. However most do leave the bank in search of better compensation as they are not competitive. Lot of locations giving the freedom to move around.
good,"Had no experience which is what manager wanted.  Thrown immediately into the job.  Terrified, never thought I would make it, but with the kindness of co-workers, I learned and became quite adept, becoming one of the most accurate closers in the department.  Loved what I did, loved the people I worked with.  Unfortunately, I was laid off after a year due to reduction in force.  I would go back in an instant if I was in a location which needed me!"
good,Lots of meetings and training. Very fast paced. Management set high sales goals for each office and gave great support to help them to reach there goals. Great employees.
good,"This was a very wonderful job to have, working with clients and customers to build relationships an help them in their financial desires was the best part of the job."
good,"SunTrust was my first corporate experience. The teammates at SunTrust helped to mold me into a more professional worker, and everyone is willing to help!"
good,I really enjoyed my 21 years of working there.  I gained alot of knowledge and experience.The people that work there are generally great to work with.
good,Overall a well cultured company. Maintained anywhere around 90-114 calls per day and a constant learning experience (how  to handle irate or uninterested clients) Management at the time was fair however was constant change.
good,Very professional business atmosphere. Fine dining for lunch and mall for shopping during breaks. most people enjoy working here with very knowledgeable people
good,"In this position I worked from home and enjoyed my job.  I only left to relocate closer to family memmbers.  I was well trained in each position I worked.  I was offered the opportunity for advancement, and received a resonable wage."
good,I had a great team at SunTrust not only in branch but area managers as well. A lot of advancement opportunities and a great work enviroment. Overall I would recomend SunTrust to anyone.

good,great staff and managers. good training and management supportt. cool environment to work in. great benefits and pay. overall the best company I've worked for
good,"It's cliché to say that everyone's work day is different, yet true; for some a work day is mostly hard, difficult, frustrating and for others it's exciting, fun...etc. My days at work are mostly interesting and enlightening and sometimes frustrating and disappointing. My days are interesting because of all the different experiences they bring either with colleagues or clients, there is so much opportunity to learn. My experiences and background has taught me to value and embrace difference and that has proven very valuable in time of miscommunication and disagreement. I learn to be more patient in different ways with colleagues, client and myself on a regular basis. I get quite disappointed and frustrated, as a client services representative, when for reasons out of my control I am unable to deliver for my clients, and also sometimes when the job get really tough, just because it's that kind of day. My days are quite enjoyable when I know that I am a big factor to the smile my clients walk out with on their faces, and I model all the behaviors of a great teammate and contributor."
good,Fun and productive workplace on the branch level. Team was like a family away from home. Upper management not the greatest or fairest but branch managers were usually great to work for.
good,"A positive work environment with good benefits. I always felt like part of a team that was heading in a good direction. Management was supportive, and did a good job of keeping the employees informed of anything that would impact us."

good,"A typical day at work are getting referral for our Personal Banker.  Bank operations vault teller, processing deposit, loan payment and opening closing of the branch."
good,"I was a Branch Manager at SunTrust for over 4 years. I needed to move to Upstate NY, and they don't service NY State. My co-workers were fantastic and I still keep in touch. My Manager was tough, but most Manager's need to be that way to attain their own goals. She was also fair, and if you had any questions, she was always willing to help."
good,Good work place with a great team work and on the job training.
good,"This is a great company to work for if you have strong customer service and money handling skills. Me being new to banking, there was a lot of information to take in but it doesn't take long to grasp it at all. And clients can can give you a hard time at first but you have to learn not to take it personally. Many just don't like change."
good,A day at work consists of great vibes and plenty data to interpert and anaylze.
good,"- cash managing"
good,"They had a great environment, however our specific department was outsourced without warning, most likely because we were the highest paid other than management.  Co-workers were great, very professional, would honestly still be employed with the company if that situation did not happen."
good,All day you have to handle clients money transactions. If you are looking for a 9-5 job working as a teller is great.
good,"fun work enviorment, good pay, great benefits. Not easy to move up in company"
good,"But you can make the most of it by keeping yourself busy, and is also depends on who you work with and where you are located. Referrals are realistic and easy to achieve, the only downside of my location was that we were understaffed."
good,"A typical day is a very busy one, filled with many customers and following compliance and regulations."

good,"I really enjoyed working at the bank. Daily interactions with customers was very good. Some days were hectic than others,a s we all know, but nonetheless very fun. I learned a great deal about the banking and financial world, very helpful in my daily life."
good,"Suntrust is a great place to work, they give you two weeks trained vacation, the management is helpful and responsive, and your team mates always have your back. The typical day normally ranges from an eight to ten hour shift averaging anywhere from 85 to 120 or more calls a day. The most enjoyable and the most hard part of the job is taking one of those really hard calls where the customer calls in hating you and making them your new best friend for the fifteen minutes,thirty minutes, or in the extreme case hour; but when they leave happy and you leave and impression on them it really pays off."
good,"Greet the clients as they entered the bank. Helped them with their transactions, problems, and needs. I leaned how to handle some irate clients and solve their disputes with the bank in a friendly, efficient manner. I supervised three tellers and had a wide variety of personalities in all of them. We were a team, all willing to provide excellent customer service. I enjoyed working with the manager and ssistant manager. They were both very helpful and considerate of employees. There were no hard parts of the job, as I enjoyed working with the public. I most enjoyed helping clients with their banking transactions and getting to know each of them personally."
good,"Suntrust was a great company to work for! Management was understanding and reasonable. The pay & benefits were excellent! 401k matching, location, associates were great. Unforntunately, the Data Center moved from Atlanta to Pittsburgh, and didn;t take any one from Atlanta with them."
good,"Everyday was a new day to do a better job. I liked working with the vendors, paying the bills, and managing the front desk. Management and co-workers are all interesting people because they all have a point of view. The hardest part of the job was unhappy customers/vendors and the most enjoyalbe part of the job was the stability and pot luck."
good,Advancements were positive and the company was willing to work with you towards your goals.
good,"Got promoted 3 times in 5 years but was way underpaid because I moved up within the company.  They only raise you a little at a time and don't match what they pay anyone else coming in.  Great benefits, excellent training and ongoing education.  I loved working for them."
good,Great benefits only improvement they would need is pay people off the streets make much more than veteran employees which isn’t fair. There is no way a teller with no experience should be making much more than a teller that’s been with the company 5+ years. Culture is family like culture. Hours are great!
good,"Great job for entry level because all training is included, no degrees or certificates required. Good pay for the job plus great benefits. Expected to work 40 hours a week. If you had a doc appt or something with no sick days or other time off you were expected to make up for the hours elsewhere so you can keep your benefits. Other employees are great to work with; you become a family and rely on each other."

Be comfortable with sales and recommendations while reaching out to clients and you will be successful"

The hardest part of the job is basically when there are irate clients, but I can handle them with grace as always. "
good,"I learned alot working at Suntrust Bank. It could have been a good career. I had good benefits. The customers was loyal. The managment was even good. The only problem I had with Suntrust is that they wanted to talk every one into a loan when don't need it. I know its the person deceision but the bank doesn't always tell them what's going to happen when you miss one payment. Also, I would really feel responable if I was the one who talk them into the loan and then they are out of a house or car."

good,I enjoyed my stay at suntrust bank. I left due to a relocation outside of the area where suntrust is located. There are ups and downs to any job and I still felt satisfied with my job and I felt my job was secure.
good,Banking hours and holidays are great. It's rare to be asked to work more than 40 hrs per week. There are many required training sessions to attend so you aren't asked to do something before you've learned it. Pay is comparable to other banks in the industry
good,"SunTrust is a great company to work for and I loved my job. I hated having to leave. If I could I would go back. The manager makes a huge difference of course, but the company is great about benefits, vaca, and time off."

I did webinars on the computers for new users that were moving to the new system and if there was not training to perform, I would assist with other employees that were learning the old. I also had to learn the new system. The person that was suppose to help me really didn't. I was put in a space alone and had to learn a lot myself on how the system worked. This was a temp position. Once I learned the position, I did not have any issues."

good,I worked there almost 7 years I loved most of the people but now I see they really don't care about the teammates when push comes to shove I was not shown any loyalty after being there many years with not so much as a verbal or written warning on my record. There is an employee there that has been reported for sexual harassment an low and behold she is still there I guess sexual harassment is ok and welcoming there but simple things that should have required a write up are huge but I still think it is who you know.

good,I began an awesome career at SunTrust! Started at the bottom of the totem pole and ended up in Management. Absolutely loved what I had accomplished.
good,"When I worked at Suntrust I was a loan officer assistant. I would contact clients to retrieve the proper paper work before I even submitted the loan package to the underwriters. I would put together the loan package, upload the file into the system, then follow up with the underwriter to see if there was any other documents needed. I worked for two loan officers so I would travel between branches ensuring client information was kept safe. The hardest part of this job was having to rely on other people to have the closing documents prepared. The most enjoyable part of this job was seeing the smiles on our clients faces when they finally closed on a house."

good,"Financial Modeling & Analysis"
good,"Overall, I am satisfied with SunTrust Banks, Inc."
good,This job is a fast pace environment because all file that are review are time sensitive. Meaning once file is receive in office we must gather all information need so file can be move to QA and then to negotiator for approval of denial.

good,"As a Teller at Suntrust i would have to be very detail oriented in a very fast paced environment because i was the only teller operating the drive thru in a very busy part of town. We would have to also meet our daily sales goals (as well as with Wells Fargo) which meant we had to sometims call our sutomers after hours or we would have to try and sell the appropriate products to the customers while they were in the bank at the time, I really enjoyed working with Suntrust, all of there employees were very hard working and weall seemed to get along great.

good,What Ive learned at Suntrust was to be very attentive to detail. Listen to direction and and be able to change direction in a moments notice.
good,This is one of the largest employers in the area for Central Florida along with the theme parks. For the most part they retain employees for long terms.
good,Great company to work for. Wish they would have had a position for me. I contracted for 3 1/2 months.
good,"It was a high paced job. If you want to move up, you need to know someone. Training was very good and precise. I would work there again."
good,"Good place to work, pay was ok, they did start pushing alot of sales for the employees even if it was not at the best interest to the customer. If you didn't sell they would start performance plans."
good,It's a great place to work! I have enjoyed my time there but with the merger it's imperative to ensure that my family will continue to have necessities regardless of the change.
good,Suntrust is a good company they really work with you when it comes to family and job. The pay can be better for the amount work is done. I love the telecommute.

good,A good work environment. Friendly teammates and management has an open door policy. Work benefits in terms of vacation and salary can be better. There is work flexibility.
good,Great place to work and also a great place to learn about mortgage. I nothing bad to say about this place. Wish I wasn't laid off. The enviroment was great and employees on my team were awesome.
good,I relocated and wish to find something closer to home.  The only drawback to the company is my current manager.  I would love to make SunTrust my career home but location and flexibility isn't working out.
good,I worked at this job only part-time but while being there it was very busy and the time flew by. I learned a lot and I think it paid well for being a part time job. I would work for SunTrust again.
good,SunTrust is a great place to work. You just have to hope for the right team to make it work. I have worked here for 10 years but it's time for a change.

good,"Great place, good culture on a company level, good opportunity, good footprint throughout the country.  The benefits are good but expensive.  Compensation is adequate."
good,"Branch Managers work 55+ hours per week,"
good,"Our goal is to light the way to financial well-being.  We are client-focused, and strive to provide excellent, quality service to every customer.  To do so, it takes a team effort and a constant drive to deliver efficiency and excellence.  I am fortunate to work on three teams, on one team, Receivable and Decisioning, we post payments from Investors to the general ledger account to be reviewed by accounting mortgage analysts and claims anaysts to ensure we have been reimbursed for all funds issued to maintain foreclosed properties.  On the second team, my role is to process charged-off accounts for funds that were uncollectable from our investors and assign the reasons for the charge-offs to the various departments responsible for not being able to claim remitted funds.  The third team I work on is the Loss Analysis Feedback Loop, which analyzes a sample of all funds charged-off by the various departments and identify opportunities for improvement in the claims processes to ensure a greater percentage of funds billed will be remitted by investors.  Each area requires great attention to detail, a wide knowledge of the various investors whose accounts we service (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Virginia Housing Authority, and other Private Investors) and their policies and procedures for submitting claims and being reimbursed for different services rendered by the vendors we utilize to maintain foreclosed properties. It also requires continuous communications between the different lines-of-business as well as interfacing with investors when there are discrepancies between what was billed"
good,"I worked as An Administrative Assistant to Branch Manager, Customer Service as to selling services and assisting customers on  a daily basis. I was also the Vault Assistance, cross-trained to be Teller and Head Teller positions."
good,Worked as a temp for 7 months.  Enjoyed my co-workers and management in the sales tax department. I would work for them again.
good,"I was a bank teller, I performed typical bank transactions. I also had to upsell bank products. I learned a lot about banking. Management was less than to be desired. It was a very easy job and I picked it up very quick. Interacting with the clientele was the best part of the job. Unfortunately my job at the bank was during the crash in the economy and my position was cut."
good,Great place to work and friendly environment.  Demanding environment and can be a little stressful.
good,"I'm coming up to my 10th year working at SunTrust and it has been a great place to call home!"
good,SunTrust is a great company to work for they train you well for the desired position.
good,"Make no mistake, this job is all about sales. You have goals to meet, even if you are a drive through teller. The locations were run with a skeleton crew and made it hard to function."
good,the company has good training classes that get u ready the work. Knowledgeable people u can always count on with any questions
good,Started my career in business and was a solid foundation! Had a great management team that supported growth and crosstraining.
good,"A typical day at work would be working quietly for about an hour until more co workers would arrive, we would talk for a moment, go get breakfast, eat, then get to work"
good,Overall SunTrust is a great place to work. I do wish the pay was a little more competitive and they were a little more flexible when it came to working remote.
good,I worked in account security and claims and it was wonderful. I gave a lot of experience in regards to fraudulent activity on credit cards and banking account. There is opportunity to advance but the pay is not that great so I took the experience and went else where. Good place to gain experience
good,I had great years at SunTrust until management was changed and they outsourced our department and got rid of management that cared for her employees and never undermined their character or speak negative about them to other employees.
good,"My duties included financial planning, asset gathering and general business development activities. I started with no asset and built a book of assets up to 11 million. I worked closely with the branch employees in identifying clients with financial planning needs."
good,Its  a pretty easy job. You have a sales goal to meet but management isn't too strict on it as long as your're trying hard and using the sales tools they give you.
good,Good place to work with flex hours available depending on 
good,"Nicer people than most investment banks. Company definitely screens for personality fit, and aligns culture with broader corporate goals and missions."
good,There is a great deal of restructuring throughout the company. There is a level of stress across the company due to all the changes and reductions in staff.
good,"Company close due to assignment was .., I really have nothing more to tell you. We were doing harp loans for the company that ended . Thank you for the time"
good,I enjoyed working at Suntrust.  The managers were nice and did not micromanage.  The co-workers were friendly and helpful.  The department closed because they are no longer doing construction.
good,SunTrust has provided an opportunity for growth and an opportunity to build a team of professionals that stayed focused on the client and teammates. They also provided training in a lot of different aspects of credit and sales processes to coaching and client focused models.
good,"Good company to work for, good work life balance. Everyone's friendly and willing to help. Management willing to assist with your needs, always someone willing to help."
good,I love to work here. the people are great and the bosses are understanding but most of all SunTrust cares about others. When it comes to those parents that don't have any body that they can leave there children there it make's it hard for me because I don't have anybody else that can stay with my kids after 4pm.
good,"Great 8-5/6 depending on the day of the week, all federal holidays off, great job security. There is a sales portion to the job that I wasn't fond of. The company often pushes employees to perform and then penalizes them with hovering and watching them closely when they do. "
good,"great people to work with and lost of growth opportunities, unfortunately not the best pay grades in the market. management is good but very little budget to invest on its employees."
good,High traffic sales environment that is based on helping clients achieve financial wellness and education. Obtaining monthly sales quotas and metric is apart of my daily plan.
good,It was one of the great companies that I had a privilege to work for the staff was a group of wonderful people and the environment was pleasant.
good,hardest part of the job was sales but it taught one to go outside of their comfort zone. Management was average and wanted to help us succeed. Not really any room to advance.
good,"SunTrust was a great company to work for, however in the past they knew that keeping the employees happy meant that would extend to clients."
good,plenty of opportunities for advancement and growth. would highly recommend to anyone considering!!!!
good,"Business decisions forced them to close our whole department of Consumer Direct Underwriters down.  They handled it well. However, it was wasted funds , in my opinion, since they had just spent funds opening the department the year before. They had good underwriters."
good,"Insured that all automated requests for SunTrust application access was correctly granted or denied, depending upon need and an indvidual's job title. "
good,"Support Team, set goals, coach team to top performance. Operationally sound branch, top of operations reports."
good,SunTrust is a good institution. The employees are great. But not a very stable employment.
good,Enjoyed working there but not same institution that I worked for in 1990's - worked this time in a Walmart branch and really enjoyed being around people.
good,"I worked in the instore branch location in Duluth, overall a decent company to work for."
good,They have great benefits and my coworkers are fantastic. Typical day we are cashing and depositing checks/cash. Processing payments and atm transactions. I am responsible for coaching and guiding tellers. Most enjoyable part of my job is customer interaction and i have learned how to provide multiple options to best benefit customers. Management could be more productive if they spent more time in branches.
good,"From Sun Trust, I never forgot that every Friday our lead was coming to our desk and asking us that where we will spend the weekend, and he was telling us about his experience."
good,"SunTrust lives by its purpose and integrates into daily work.  They believe in the value of their teammates and what they deliver to clients. Great Culture, Strong benefits."
good,"My area manager was amazing, my teammates were great to me, just my manager was not really know what he is doing, I believe he was on the wrong position. The company's culture is amazing, however, their hourly rate is extremely low. This is one of the companies I have ever worked for, if the salary was higher and the manager was other than my manager at the time, I would have not resigned, and worked there forever. At the end, I can assure anyone who receives an offer from SunTrust, that it's a great company and you will have a fabulous opportunity to grow within the organization, but, think about the salary before you sign."
good,I had the best Managers in the business at my time at Suntrust.  She was a mentor and friend and ensured all of her employees were treated with respect and were awarded every opportunity to grow
good,"great team effort, vivid culture, slow paced advancement, lower average pay for the area. Could not survive in the area I'm living with the salary plus bonus"
good,SunTrust is a great company to work for. The only problems are some management within the branch. They were not much of help when you complete training. The pay was okay but alway counter-offer.
good,"Overall, I really enjoy working in the department that I am in at the bank because it is a culturally healthy environment with great people.  It is however a bit chaotic.  Management & department structures are constantly in flux - it's been that way since I started."
good,"A typical day began by counting your money draw, making sure it was correct.  Doors open, and  I would began to put a smile on each of customer's face.  You have to give great customer satisfaction, but, meticulous in process of cashing checks, and making deposits, with accuracy and proficiency.  I was also detailed as the ATM manager.  Great place"
good,"I like all the management I dealt with my 20 years with SunTrust."
good,Suntrust is a good company and they telecommute which is great. They can pay more to their employees which would would be great. Suntrust is a good company
good,It was a fun place to work and the training was always on going.  Potential  to advance was prevalent in that job opportunities were posted as Suntrusts footprint expanded into new markets. Many employees had made life long careers at SunTrust and working along side them gave you a feeling of pride in the company.
good,"My office location was closed and staff was not retained.  My career and the careers of my co-workers have been in free fall since.  We moved to Sevierville which doesn't have the jobs to support an educated upscale work force.  Suntrust is now hiring PT people at reduced pay but the hours are practically full time.  Essentially, you work without benefits and vacation time but you must be available to accommodate them whenever.  When I worked there I loved the job, the pay and the hours.  The only drawback was staying late in the evenings to cross sell new accounts and services to fulfill goals.  Generally speaking it is the Wells Fargo scenario where you give it to the customer whether they want it or not or you don't get a raise or promotion.  In some case people were fired for not selling enough."
good,"I had a three month contract which allowed me a balance between working in the corporate office and at home. When in the office, the permanent staff was always helpful and kind."
good,I loved everything about this job except the ability to advance.  I worked very hard for this company for almost 10 years but they were not willing to advance me career wise.  It was almost like I was so good at what I did that they didn't want to move me up.
good,"Other than being downsized and let go, I really enjoyed working for SunTrust Bank.   My co-workers and superiors were very supportive and encouraging."
good,Suntrust is a great place to work in my opinion. There day is very laid back and stress free. I learned how to process the mail and document the files in the system.
good,Good place to work. Just always seems to be short staffed. Not a lot of room for advancement. Clients and management good people to work with. Just had to travel and the traffic was not good.
good,working at SunTrust has been a great experience.I presently work at the bank as a contractor but have been treated fairly.  The environment is very professional.
good,"worked with top producing loan officer for seven years.  Underwrote, processed and closed loans.  Met clients to gather information and discuss the financial needs."
good,I worked in the Correspondent dept and worked with clients all over the US. My boss was the current President of the mortgage division and is a great person to work for
good,"Great company to work for. Great company structure and upward move opportunity. Very diverse work environment."
good,Good place to work.  Good work life balance.  Fun coworkers.  Good location.  Mobility.  Benefits are decent. The hours are good

good,I really enjoyed working for Suntrust I was a good place to work I had great managers and training
good,"Great company to work for. I started as a customer service rep , I wanted a change so i went into the branch as a bank teller, then personal banker , Assistant branch manager"
good,"The typical day at work is never the same. I work with clients dealing with hardships that may prevent them from making the monthly mortgage payment. We work with the clients closely to guide them for applying for rentention or liquidation options. We work with the clients from the begining through the end of the process as a single point of contact. It helps the client build trust in our process with a consistent one on one relationship. My co-workers and I support one another focusing on the client experience. Our commitment to help our clients is difficult (to advise the client) if there is not a program that the client may not qualify for. The rewarding experience is sharing an approval of an application, especially when you worked with the clients for months trying to explore all options to prevent foreclosure. Overall I do enjoy my job and and I have built long lasting relationships with our clients."
good,"Wholesale lending has seen a lot of changes in the past few years and although SunTrust had quite a successful year in 2012, the company could not weather the storms that 2013 brought.  "
good,STM is an overall great place to work. The benefits are good and affordable. They have a Teammate health Center. They participate in the Nation Wide United Way Campaign and support Making Strides Against Cancer. There a numerous opportunities for teammates to participate in community service.
good,"Stuctured, Planned, Goals attended, Team environment, Client First"
good,"Busy days, hard work, enjoyed every moment of it."
good,"My job was to handle typical banking transactions, deposits, withdrawals, etc. The company emphasizes quality customer service above all else."
good,"Process affidavits which I learned about the different laws in all fifty states. The management went over and beyond for their employees and the co-workers are alway willing to help out when they can. the hardest thing about it was the first week learning the process, and the most enjoyable part was worknig along side people who take pride in their job."
good,loved working for this company they were always there to answer any question you have and anything else you may have a issue with. Very friendly people.
good,"SunTrust Mortgage, Inc was where I started getting my office skills and it just grew from there. They were a wonderful stepping stone as I attempt to break into the entertainment industry by giving me the basic office duty qualifications I could build on."
good,Suntrust Bank was a great place to work. The professionalism gained from this establishment has provided me with skills that I have applied to all areas of my life and management experiences.
good,"There is very little turnover at SunTrust.  I think that says a lot about the work environment, especially in today's job market.  I have enjoyed my work there and feel like the benefits are excellent."
good,"Great staff, awsome atmosphere, and the job wasnt difficult. Just wasnt right for me. Would reccomend to anyone looking to get their foot in the door in banking."
good,"A place that encourages collaboration and challenging the status quo."
good,SunTrust treats their employees very well.  I dealt with multiple managers and only dealt with one that was not honest or supportive.  They have a very sales driven culture but they provide the support to be successful.
good,"Changes often but they offer good work and a great culture. People are really receptive to adapting the job to your skills, wants, and abilities. Managers can be good or frustrating, like all jobs."
good,"I'm grateful and thankful of the opportunity SunTrust offered to me almost 10 years ago. Having no mortgage experience, SunTrust was willing and able to teach and train me in the banking industry."
good,The people are really friendly. They take proud in customer service. Overtime available is also good. The goals were a bit much. They changed on us almost every month.
good,"I enjoyed my time there and hope to return but getting back in after resigning is proving very difficult. It's a good company to work for and I made many friends there, my manager was the best in my opinion. They could make it a bit easier to grow with the company but I felt I was paid fairly and had no trouble meeting expectations."
good,"Various positions with my career at SunTrust Bank."
good,I worked in the Trust Department and was promoted to support the EVP and President in the Florida Corporate Office. I traveled to NewYork to introduce my Trust Officer to a customer that worked at a Fortune 500 company and received a CELA ( Customer Excellence and Leadership Award).
good,"Working as a group to meet Bank goals and exceed."
good,Sun Trust is a very Purpose driven company with ideal that you can truly get behind. It is important to know that things can get stressful but the companies desire to put the needs of your family first and the need of there customer first is there. I have enjoyed working for the company. Goals are realistic and they are working toward providing their employee the tools need to move forward. If you do not know anything about banking they will train you.
good,Learned the majority of my banking experience with suntrust. The underwriting and relationship management . Have made many contacts and circle of influence
good,Great training and advancement exist in retail banking. Career opportunities outside of your current line of business are completely self driven and takes a lot of effort.
good,Getting as many tasks as possible done. making sure all other duties related to the job are carried out. Make the job fun and not to stressful and I believed everyone will do their job better.
good,"What I liked most about SunTrust Bank was the opportunities they provided the staff to advance within the workplace. "
good,"I love working at SunTrust due to the teleworking options. Most employees are able to work from home between 2 to 3 days a week. The benefits are great,"
good,"I begin my day @ 6:30AM by pulling and organizing reports for the campus and my teams to set the stage for the day.  We then have several huddles with different management groups and teammates to determine the goals for the day and month.  We have come into the age of allowing a partial work from home, but does not have the availability for full time remote, at least not in the underwriting or quality control areas.  "
good,We were like a family. We worked together and cared about each other. We would help each other be successful and meet individual goals. No cut throat or back stabbing. Even when someone left we remained in contact. We could not talk for 5 years and call and have a friend to talk to -seeming like no time had passed at all.
good,Great place to work but not much room to advance. We were responsible for our workflow and meeting deadlines. Excellent work environment. Everyone worked as a team to complete end of month metrics.
good,"I enjoyed my experience with Sun Trust, The people I worked with was great. The work was steady and the hours were ok. I did not like traveling to Sandy Springs traffic was horrible."
good,Suntrust offers a wealth of opportunity and opportunity for growth.  They focus on personal development as well as keeping their employees happy.  There are many social opportunities to meet people as well.

good,"A good work life balance at SunTrust. Good and helpful team mates. Overall a good work environment. They pay you overtime in case you have to spend more than the standard 40 hours a week at work. SunTrust has a good medical, dental and vision plans. They also have a good 401 K plan for its employees. The main aim of the bank is to guide clients towards financial confidence."
good,"Management was the reason I stayed until we were laid off. Everyone was professional and we all worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was the long hours, the volume was very high, yet we all maintained a positive attitude and got the job done while meeting deadlines. Management had an open door policy and she was always willing to help."
good,"SunTrust has the best culture regarding freedom of religion, inclusiveness and ethics.  They really care about their employee's well-being and wants us to succeed"
good,"I believe this is a need that everyone has, but don't think it is properly used.  I enjoyed building relationships with my customers, and finding and filling needs  for them."
good,Working for sun-trust as a Financial Services Representative fresh out of high school was a very good start for me. It provided me with the ability to build my communication skills as well as grow in building my  own knowledge in banking services.
good,"I really enjoyed working at SunTrust Bank but, the management was not a good fit for me. The manager was not willing to work after 3pm each day and she did not work the weekend. Some of clients could only come in after 3pm or some could only come into the bank over the weekend. There was goals we needed to meet and we needed the help of our manager but, she would not adjust her schedule to assist her team in making monthly and quarterly goals."
good,i enjoyed my time at Suntrust. Definitely the best job i have ever held. It was a completely different atmosphere coming from my previous company. I loved the people I worked with.

good,Great company with great ethics and some good leadership. I very much enjoyed my 12 years at SunTrust until the location closed. I liked the opportunities that were provided to me. SunTrust took care of me and I took care of my branch in return. Great relationship.
good,"I absolutely love working for SunTrust Bank. Senior leadership is amazing.In the past three years, I have been promoted three different times. The only reason I would leave would be for more money."
good,"CONS-Goals are set extremely high and impossible to attain. Every year these goals are raised and management holds everyone responsible for them, regardless of the situation."
good,I worked with a team of 5 people in a close environment.  If you get along with your team this job was great! if your team does not get along this job is very stressful.
good,"Sales goals, rewards and rate of pay not acceptable.  Pay raises where cut and max possible increase was 1.5% for the pass 3 years."
good,Great company to work for and the majority of the managers are great. Very good chances for advancement and good incentives.
good,"I processed loans very quickly and met deadlines, the supervisor was very understanding and did not micromanage. I thought ahead about what the borrower would need and submitted it to underwriting for approval."
good,"Client Break\Fix Trouble tickets and Work Orders arrived in technicians que for specific locations supported. Tech was able to view SLA with time remaining to complete Requests.  Contact clients to setup site visits for trouble tickets and schedule visits for work orders. "

good,Very diverse atmosphere. Great place to work to develop management skills and growth within the organization. Great client communication with the customers.
good,"Very nice place to work but sometimes have unrealistic sales and referral goals. However, the referral incentives make up for some of this cons."
good,A typical work day started in the afternoon.  Your work was given to you and the sooner the work was finished the faster you get to go home.  Management was also understanding and they made the place fun and comfortable.
good,"I loved working here, it was my first real teller job, I learned a lot about banking and financial procedures and laws. Had to sell but my job did not hang in the balance if you missed your goal on selling products."
good,"HSBC provide a great training to their employees in order to be successful at their jobs, great company to work with they set their standers really high"

good,always focus in what you are doing. management always review our role and what to do
good,Great incentives.. location is great if you live in the area. Management were great as well
good,I enjoyed working with the people and the clients at SunTrust.
good,"I felt I received adequate training and ongoing assistance as needed to give a good performance and achieve an excellent performance status for the time I was there. Since part time hours are best for me with the limitations on the amount I can earn and receive Social Security, this worked out well for me. Was so sad the department was basically done away with except for a skeleton crew."
good,"SunTrust Bank is an excellent company to work for. They work hard to develop their employees and have the tools necessary for the employees to succeed. I especially enjoyed helping clients develop a financial plan that helps them reach their goals. Co-workers are great to work with. Everyone wants everyone else to succeed and prosper. If one succeeds, everyone succeeds."
good,"A fast pace environment of process and compliance validation within each line of business. "
good,"Customer service representative"
good,"I worked from a report of complex loans sent over from reviewers that couldn't resolve the issues.  My goal was to resolve the issues as diligently as possible, by reaching out to borrowers, sellers, settlement agents, loan officers and contacts within the bank. Once the issue was resolved, I would be able to insure the loan in FHAC and move the loan to the next phase.  My managers and co-workers were great to work with, they all brought something different to the table, lots of mortgage experience with years of service being 20 years or more.  If an unusal scenerio came up, you could always find someone within the dept who could assist.  The hardest part of the job was having to rely, on someone on the outside for assistance and them not taking ownership.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was having a GREAT loan where the ownership was taken in account from the front end to the very end."
good,"A typical day at work would be getting in at or before 7am beginning a day of either review or compliance. Working towards and exceeding goal of fully completing six files per day. Learning system work around for a positive result. Learning to work paperless file while still working paper files in dated order. Being able to alternate file upon managers request to complete ""rush"" files. Helpful management that was willing to learn from me as well as teaching. The hardest part of the job was having the same login to certain systems as other reviewers. New reviewers would often enter the incorrect password more than three times and would lock out everyone. This would take a minimum of 24 hours to reset causing complete files to sit until system reset to run last test. The most enjoyable part of being employed here was working alone not being micro managed and being allowed to plan our own day. We were able to use any method that worked well for us as individuals. The end result was to have the files reviewed carefully to eliminate errors and unnecessary charges to the bank."
good,"While communication with staff is not this company's strongest point, the flexibility this company provides is an excellent attribute that more companies need/should follow.  Work/Life Balance is more and more important in today's work environment, and I give 5 stars for this benefit."
good,This job was great I learned so much. The only thing that was so bad about it was that I only worked like 25 hours a week and I have kids to support and I wasnt able to do that with those kinds of hours
good,My employment was short term but very exciting and easy to learn.  The company focused a lot on training and gave you the tools to advance if you wanted to.

good,I believe I have a wonderful opportunity for career growth.I believe SunTrust cares about its employees and they foster in your success as an employee.
good,"Of course, I am still employed and this company has been awesome to me. There were minor bumps in the road with teammates and management, but nothing that HR couldn’t resolve. There are many resources that are at your fingertips if you are dedicated to what you enjoy doing in the company. Overall, it’s a wonderful place to work."
good,"The managers I have had at SunTrust lived and advocated a good work/life balance. Obviously when the work needs to be completed you stay and do so, but if nothing is pressing there is no criticism for getting out earlier here and there to go play with your kids."
good,great place to work.  Loved the work environment.  a lot of opportunities to learn.  different network apparatuses and shops(network people will understand).
good,I was able to move into 3 different positions thru my career there which was nice but it is hard to work in a branch with such a small staff b/c when someone is out sick or on vacation it can be tough.
good,"I loved working at SunTrust Mortgage.  The coworkers were helpful.  The vice president had her dog in the office.  It was a very relaxed friendly atmosphere.  We had once a month ""fun"" day which was a couple hours once a month. We would play games, etc."
good,I enjoy working with SunTrust.  They are very flexible and family oriented.  They allow for you to take care of any personal matters when you need to.  Coworkers are friendly and very helpful. I have learned very much working with them and would love to continue to grow within the company but the current merger may make that a problem.
good,I enjoyed my time with SunTrust bank. It was a good first job out of college. It taught me how to work with a team on meeting goals. The management was always putting its employees in a position to succeed.
good,"I enjoy going to work each day and assisting our clients with their financial needs. I work with a great group of people and everybody gets along, I would like to continue to work at SunTrust but am in need of a position with more challenges and better compensation."
good,"Based on your knowledge and job related experience, there was opportunities to advance especially in the collections and loan recovery departments. The hardest part of the job was competing against those with seniority in the company who always got the preferred schedules and time off. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and the family like culture and work environment."
good,"SunTrust constantly makes you feel valued through employee bonuses based on performance, recognition of successes through reward systems, and overall friendly environment that produced happy clients and businesses."
good,"A typical day with SunTrust is always an exciting adventure, helping clients to achieve financial wellbeing and establishing great lasting relationships. What I’ve learned through SunTrust is how to successfully coach behaviors and task according to their model.  The SunTrust management has always been available and willing assist in any endeavor, which has produced a comfortable working environment. The most enjoyable thing is seeing lives change through a complex financial world.  The most difficult thing is what I’m experiencing now, the closing of SunTrust in West Virginia market."
good,Closing - They are closing the Maryland site.  Enjoyed working there but unfortunately employment is ending.  We are all being displaced in the coming months.

good,"Great company to work with. Management very good, help employees. Company culture is wonderful. The hardest part is calls and invite clients to the Branch."

good,"worked there 30 years, however was not given a chance to advance. too many management changes, i assisted with training for roles but couldnt get the roles myself"
good,The reason I'm leaving is due to a reduction in force.  I have nothing bad to say about the company.  My career here has been good and I'll be leaving with a lot of good relationships.
good,"SunTrust in Atlanta is a good employer.  You have an opportunity to work with great people and good management. It is considered a conservative regional bank but with very sound management practices.  Like any employer nowadays there is a high risk for periodical downsizings due to cyclical business, business processes being outsourced or reduction in force due to automation.  Overall, it is a great place to work.  I would not hesitate to return to SunTrust."
good,"I worked some days 10 hours making calls trying to bring in new clients and new money giving clients updates on promotions like Home loans, Auto loans, Personal loans and CD's and more. I always greeted customers and offered them my time and knowledge. I attended managers meetings and also had a meeting every morning with my employees I loved working with my manager  he was a great help to our customers he spoke several different language's  and could communicate with our Spanish clients we also had a mixed culture and got along very well. the hardest part of my job was leaving my Clients especially my elderly ones that trusted me and always needed my help and looked for me when they came in the bank. over all I loved my job and my clients the location was great and the time getting to know the employees and the clients I would not changed anything with that set up."
good,Typical day at work is a lot of onsite calls and meetings.Staffing on offboarding routine.Maintaining multiple trackers.I would like to continue working at IBM given an opportunity but not sure of future .I learnt a lot in the orle of a project mgnt admin but it required me to stretch long hours .It was not allowing me enough time with my kid and family
good,"SunTrust Robinson Humphrey (""STRH"") has great people and is a great learning experience for any person fresh out of college. Though the compensation is light relative to the rest of the Street, I would highly recommend working at STRH. The hours are unpredictable which is a pain and the analyst position lacks a work-life balance."
good,Great company to work for; enjoy our workdays.  I would recommend Suntrust to anyone interested in the banking industry.  I would prefer to have a higher salary and better annual increases but the work environment is good.
good,Area management makes theirs elves known. Operationally sound. Wonderful culture. Enjoyable environment and team building an development. Not your typical finance company.
good,"A typical day includes doing transactions, speaking to clients about offers they have and trying to get them more financially stable. i have learned to use a fax machine, use a multi line phone, using and sending email thru word, counting large amounts of money, learning how to handle rude clients/customers. the hardest part of the job for me is sales, i don't like the idea of sales to be part of my job. the most enjoyable part is my team and how much we help each other and trust each other."

Seeing and doing intake for clients  in need of mortgages, follow up on already submitted loan applications, contacting closing agents for up-coming closings on mortgages. Doing a lot of networking with everyone involved in real estate sales.  Belonged to a great team which made the job a very creative environment.  Hardest part of the job, dealing with clients that were not very truth-full with their applications for mortgages and having to decline their applications. Most enjoyable going to a real estate purchase where I was the lender and seeing the faces of the new home owners, that was very full-filling.  I learned to work under tremendous pressure and competition to produce."
good,Enjoyed my job and learned a lot about fraud. It was  a very busy and somewhat stressful at times. The hardest part about this just was determining whether it was really fraud or someone was just making a false claim.
good,Professional and respectful atmosphere. Love working with the people there. Management wants their employees to excel
good,"SunTrust is well position Regional Bank with a South Eastern footprint stretching from Maryland to Florida to Tennessee."

good,Management was always supportive and encouraging.  Working with the community was always the best part of this job.  Co-workers were always making each day fun and interesting.
good,"A typical day at work depended upon the department you are in.  Management style, policies, dress codes and lunch/break policies change with management instead of being company wide.  So one must learn the politics again. Some would quote the law with out knowing the law or consulting with anyone else.  Other managers made work life a comfortable and inviting place. "
good,"Suntrust Bank was an exciting place to work. Management ensured you received comprehensive training and also encouraged cross training so employees had an idea of how the organization worked as a whole and how each department complemented each other."

good,I loved working with this company as a first time teller. They took time to train me and help me understand the basics of being a teller. Super friendly staff!
good,"My typical day was to monitor CA7 for scheduled batch jobs, set up jobs to run through CA7, convert UNIX jobs that were manually run, but run through CA7.  Set up and delete CA7 access for users.  The hardest part of the job was to be professional as you trained your replacement, knowing you were losing your job, and they always requested that I trained them.  The most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers, we were a small group and learned to work together very well, bounced problems and ideas off each other."
good,"During my time at Sun Trust. I quickly noticed that it was fast pace but also laid back. The people were welcoming, polite and professional. I learned a lot about the inner workings of bank that I didn't know before. My manager was approachable yet stern but she took the time to help whenever she saw opportunity. I enjoyed being with my coworkers everyday. They made the workday enjoyable."
good,"As with many places, the Branch Managers want a free lunch. The upper levels however, really understand how to make a business work. They genuinely care about the people. It is the branch mangers who need a tighter reign."
good,"Job consisted of appraisals and and loan processing. a lot of scanning,filing and data entry. And if must say so myself, it was an awesome job and I love working there!"
good,"This branch that I worked at was in a grocery store.  I was the Assistant Branch Manager and the Acting Branch Manager.  Since I was doing both jobs I managed to come in early and get both jobs of paperwork done before the arrived and we opened the branch.  When the team arrived, they would do all of there opening functions.  We always made time for a morning huddle to talk things out and to see where things had gone wrong.  If the team did not make there daily goals, the difference were added to that days goal.  There were days that I work all day, because business problems and trying to get customer problem resolved quickly.  My team at this branch most new employees and they had to be trained, which was part of my position as Branch Manager. We made our bank product goals most of the time.  Our deposit dollars goal and loan goal was made some months.  The economy was changing and was hard to get the big dollars in and big loans."

good,"Started the day with a huddle in which we reviewed previous day and month to date results vs goals. We made an action plan accordingly. As a manager I contacted a number of clients daily, pre set appointments for the week and spent part of the day visiting prospects. I coached teammates and assisted with their customers"
good,"Referral's "
good,"Working for this company was a great learning experience. When you walk into a bank you don't expect to be offered to buy something, but we do have to offer a variety of products to our clients. Coming from a strong sales background it was a little difficult to learn the banking kind of sales because you can't lose your client unlike other sales jobs you work with a limited amount of clients."
good,"Great company. Great benefit. and great place to work."

good,"At SunTrust Bank I started out as a full time teller. I was then promoted to Financial Services Representative where I assisted clients by opening checking, savings, money market, IRA, and business accounts. I also assisted clients with any questions or concerns they had regarding their accounts. I also offered additional products and services I felt would benefit the client. I also supervised the tellers on a daily basis as far as scheduling and policy and procedures are concerned. I also worked very closely with the Branch Manager and acted as Branch Manager in her absence."
good,"Wonderful company to work for. Great training program, great management team, hardest part about work was the many federal laws they must be practiced and the worry of being robbed, best part about the job was the friendly work environment."

good,awesome place to work. teamwork is great not many turn overs. ample chances to grow. management can be shady at times but in most occasions great place and casual attire.
good,"I didn't have ""typical"" days. Every day was a mix of standard ""in the box"" meetings, management and working on new business standards for clients the Bank had not typically dominated. "
good,SunTrust bank was a very good institution to work for.  The day to day workflow was very challenging and they provide an environment where learning is paramount.  Upper management is perhaps the worst in the industry as leaders changed quite frequently.  The workplace culture is very good and the persons are from a diverse background.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting clients from different walks of life.
good,We make it a fun place to work. Client love to come in to do their banking with us and talk with us. We great all customers when they walk in the doors and are friendly to them.

good,"SunTrust has come a long way over the past 5 years to ensure that they create and maintain a sense of inclusion.  There are still challenges among the upper level of management; however, most of the company embodies this culture full heartedly.  And even the upper level of management is trying hard to embrace this."
good,"I worked for SunTrust as a contractor for almost a year. I really enjoyed working on my team. There did seem to be a lack of organization on the business side. As a web developer, there were projects which would continue have requirements rewritten without any real purpose."
good,"Leadership strives to do what is in the best interest of their associates.  As a result, the associates in turn do what is right for their clients which creates a win/win environment within the bank and out."

good,"Suntrust  es un banco que le permite a sus empleados la posibilidad de superarse y escalar posiciones, entrena en cada uno de sus campos de empleo, durante mi experiencia laboral con ellos logré aprender muchas cosas relacionadas con el sistema financiero estadounidense.

También, atender reclamos y solucionarlos de manera pronta y sin traumatismos"
good,I love what I do. It's a good company with a good culture and good management. It is very client centric so meeting their needs is top priority. You have to be motivated and work hard if you want to be successful.
good,"Since HDQ is located in Atlanta, GA, working in VA many were able to work at home a few days a week.  Most everyone works as a team at SunTrust and most everyone is proud of what they do.  It is a great place to work."
good,"Great place to work. SunTrust takes pride on their employees' talent. Salary is competitive, and work life balance is above average. Downside: Not enough paid time off vacation and sick time are combined."
good,"As Receptionist for Corporate Lending, I had the opportunity to work with and meet many wonderful people in the Chattanooga area.  I did all typing and computer work for the department of 6 VP's.  At that time, computers were not that prevalent in the office.  As I had just completed a computer course at Chattanooga State, I had an advantage on a few items to clarify and assist with."
good,Overall an amazing place to work.  I have worked with this company for 13 years.  I started in the branches in management and now work on the fraud dept.  I have been in fraud now for 8yrs.   All is well there just the salary for the work you do is the issue. This is all I will discuss at this time.
good,"Fun place to work, however advancements were far and in between. Also, the annual raises would be very low, most times it would be under 5%. Also no way to earn extra time off."
good,It has been years but did like working  Sun Trust until the merger.  It was a nice place to work and I had every opportunity to advance my career and I did.
good,"A typical day at SunTrust bank commenced with me checking my voicemail and checking the mailbox for our entire department as I was the mailbox manager.  Next, I would check the internal mailbox to see if any refund checks were received as processing those in a timely fashion was of great importance.  I received mail all day regarding opening new accounts and closing accounts. I ensured that all necessary trust documents were received so that I could go into the system to code what kind of trust or estate tax trust account it was.  I also processed new EIN's via ssa.gov and I processed all incoming tax refunds and dispersed the funds to the appropriate account and processed accounts payable for all applicable trust accounts (those clients with staff).  I also completed monthly reconciliation on all payroll, federal and state tax accounts."
good,Open up secured areas to retrieve cash box.  Wait on customers and help them with products and services.  Run their transactions quickly and accurately.  Balance our cash box daily.  Prepare work for the courier pick up for end of day.  Secure cash and negotiable instruments for the evening in the vault.  Set timers and run reports for end of day.  Set alarms when exiting the building.
good,Good workplace but low end on technical applications.  Outsourcing all of development is causing a lot of people to look for new positions external to the company
good,Upper management is very supportive and involved in the teammates' development. Daily motivational games. Coaching sessions with several teammates each day to development them and set them up for success. Team meetings are recommended and are essential to your teams' success.
good,This was my first office job and i loved it. The managers took a chance at hiring me due to my lack of experience for the job but still hired me. Ive worked there for nearly 2 years and never saw myself wanting to work anywhere else.
good,"Greeting clients at the drive through window and assisting in the lobby. Enjoyed my job thoroughly . "

good,Upon the employment in this company I was been molded how to be a business thinker. The secret here is to have hard-works and strategies in dwelling with different clients.
good,SunTrust has been a great place to work over the past 12+ years of my career.  I'm simply keeping my options open for future career advancement and growth.
good,When I worked there I was a peak time teller so I worked the busiest hours of the day but we had a great branch manager/head teller that made the job easier.
good,Great purpose!  Solid company.  Always finding a new way to promote financial confidence. Looking to move national by incorporating lending online.
good,"In-store branches are closing at a fast rate for SunTrust. However, by far the best company I have worked for. They have well trained staff and always seek to improve."

good,"Loved working as the sales operations manager and working with a great team of professionals.  I was in direct sales prior to this role and was constantly being asked to help with other members of the team, CRM, reporting and proposal management.  Was asked to assume this role full time and spent nine years in that function.  Loved just about ever minute of the time spent here.  Unfortunately, the roll was eliminated during the banking recession along with most of the senior management on the team."
good,Culture is a huge factor when deciding where to work. I value the relationships I created at SunTrust and enjoyed being a part of this great company.

Strong working relationship with underwriters, co-workers and management."

This keeps the morale up and wanting teammates to come back to work.
good,"I have enjoyed working at SunTrust Bank.  SunTrust is a good company to work for with many benefits and great people.   However, they are laying off departments at the loan processing center where I work and that is why I am searching for a new position."
good,"When I first started working this job the wife was not very nice. She was older and set in her ways. Her husband on the other hand was a sweetheart. I later learned her ways and we became very close. She taught me to be patient."
good,Being a teller has helped me to multi task more efficiently and it's a great way to learn how to hold a conversation. It builds a great team ethic while enabling one to hold themselves accountable for the work you have as an individual employee. It is a high paced work environment that is challenging and rewarding. There are a lot of opportunities for advancement and they provide the necessary aids to advance in any position. The most challenging part of the job is juggling the sales side with the customer service piece while ensuring the client feels valued.

good,Typical day of taking inbound customer service calls. I learned alot about the banking business as a whole. Management for my team was great. My team of co-workers were a fun groupto work with. The hardest part part of the job was explaining new products to already existing customers who really had no interest in trying new things. the most enjoyable part was the competition we co-workers engaged in to get the highest quality scores.
good,"I went from just processing wire transfers to becoming an investigations specialist. We handled large amounts of money via fed, when they were wrong, were not applied, applied incorrectly, my department worked very hard and fast to correct the situation. I enjoyed all of my co-workers and management, when someone was out the other two of us picked up the work load and completed the job, Since it was only 3 of us in that part of the department, we had no choice but to have each others side.

This job helped me in having patience because you deal with a lot of different customers such as elderly, young, people that could not speak English well and to take calls for the deaf through assistance.

My co-workers were very professional and assisted me a great deal in my training. The hardest part of the job for me personally was the schedule. Unfortunately, the hours that I would be working and the hours of my husbands schedule did not mesh and therefore I was unable to continue what would have been a very promising career. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with clients, and learning new skills."

good,Suntrust is a great place to maintain stability and gain financial knowledge while dealing with clients.
good,An amazing company to work for. Great growth potential and ability to succeed in any role.
good,"Before the merger, the environment was phenomenal. Now there is an obvious lack of diversity in senior leadership, and it is plain to see that the boys club is where it’s at. Changes are being made with little regard to morale and without consulting the (diverse) Suntrust legacy leadership. Things are being done the BB&T way, whether or not it makes sense or works well. I hope the culture does not continue down this path, but if it does then the place I loved coming to work at with a HIGH retention of employees (due to fantastic management) will likely face a mass exodus."
good,"I became a SunTrust team member via a merger in 2005.  They raised the bar for commitment and professionalism. As one of the largest regional financial centers they had many areas of opportunities to allow you to learn and grow as a banker.
