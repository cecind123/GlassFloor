bad,picking the cotton
bad,"Despite it's low reviews on Yelp, I decided to try them out anyways. Immediately they had a job offer below my going pay rate on my first interview but I was willing to at least listen. I turned them down for that job but my PSG rep said she would work to find me something that matched my skill set and current pay rate. In the end she talked a big game but didn't deliver by getting something that paid even less. She explained it was just a way to get my foot in the door of the company and I could work with the supervisors from there. Not only did meeting with the supervisors go nowhere, the commute was much too far and PSG couldn't find me something closer to home. I thought it can't hurt to try and see what the company could offer so I agreed to a short stay and after 3 days it was definitely clear a supervisor would not be speaking to me about better positions available especially when the that supervisor had had those days off. So I contacted my rep to let her know it wasn't working out and not worth my 52 round trip miles daily commute. I was simply told by her ""If you don't like it, we will find someone else that will"" and she acted as I was the offending party. Thanks for being compassionate, polite and helpful... After that I was done when it became clear they really aren't interested in your background and what you can bring to the table. They tell you what you want to hear to get you through the door just to fill the mostly entry or low level jobs they have so THEY can get paid. Also, the jobs listed on their website are mostly fake. Definitely earned their low ranking"
bad,"If you get hired watch for the additional duties as they switch duties and expectation of working as many hours as necessary beyond 8, 10, 12 hours and not what was mentioned in the interview"
bad,"Certain people at the company were not professional and did not treat people professionally.  Throwing things, swearing at them.  When taken to the HR department was told to ""try and figure it out""."
bad,Working for this company only hurt my resume. They do ZERO training. I was hired on as a leasing agent and dumped into a Manager job with no training or knowledge of the company or policies.
bad,"They are sending A/R and collections overseas. Not sure how long I'll have a job. Stressful place to work, must take home laptop every night, day off, vacation to work from home. Work/life balance is poor, management is lacking."
bad,"Answering phone calls, taking lease payments, and posting available units on craigslist."
bad,"Very good at Team level."
bad,The management doesn't promote growth. New roles or crossing training doesn't happen at Dover. Great perks but the management makes it hard to enjoy working for Dover.
bad,Long hrs & no recognition. A lot of travel involved throughout the country. Most jobs are given at a moments notice and Blueprints and other documentation is provided late as well. Often giving you little preparation time but preparing you to work under pressure.
bad,management was awful hr was a joke all workers got along good fun guys to work with
bad,I like to work hard and this company had plenty of work.When the economy slowed they had to let me go.The job required alot of travel and I like to drive
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the families and the children.  working with the families and seeing the progress in the situation.
good,"Lots of IT outsourced to foreign entities. Insufficient compensation for living in the Chicagoland area in my role, considerably lower than industry average for my position. Very fast paced with lots of responsibility piled on and little to no opportunity for advancement."
good,Talented people but the management is not incentivized to grow; prefers to defend and maintain; a lot of operational opportunities exist and will likely be driven by Dover Corporation in response to Wall Street
good,Entreprise ayant beaucoup de challenge au niveau TVA
good,I didn't really enjoy it at all not reliable with the hours a lot of miscommunication and angry customers because of their unorganized.
good,Average company. Difficult to have a balanced work and life.  Mix between a centralized and decentralized decision making. Vary focused on safety which is great
good,Wouldn't be bad if people communicated better and the work flow was better organized. They didn't take good care of valuable employees and the company definitely played favorites.
good,"typical day at work includes taking care and teaching children"
good,Good compensation and good benefits.  Learned a lot and was able to grow professionally.  Interaction across many different types of businesses and locations
good,El salario y prestaciones buenas sin embargo el balance equilibrio vida laboral no es bueno. Tiempo limitado para disfrutar con la familia
good,"A typical day at work is long, but also fun and exciting."
good,"My title is Material Handler but i enjoy the opportunity to work and  learn multiple positions such as supply chain, planning, shipping and receiving, and machine operator."
good,Design work forum. No hazzles on the work front. Flat type system. Not much hierarchy conflicts in here. Continuous pipeline of projects. Peers are young and the workplace is filled with cheer
good,"I would work there again, if an opportunity  came up. Review product cost and results from manufacturing operations. Review direct labor actual hours compared to standard hours allowed."
good,"In general the work environment is good."
good,Global company with diverse product lines. Good way to learn different industries and global markets affecting your business.
good,Dover has some really great people that work there.  Very smart and very dedicated people who will do whatever is needed to get the job done.
good,The salary is really low like like 20 dollars per day 8hours a day. I dont know the case in Dover.US. But it is common in china. So I dont think this gonna help you a lot!
good,Its a good place to start but they will use you a lot. Be prepared to be on your feet and moving quickly. If you dont get something done someone else will do it or you'll hold everyone back.
good,"Dover is a great company to work for and the CEO is awesome while some of those underneath the CEO as well as under the presidents of all four segments are not as great!  As with any company, especially oil and gas, there is a lot of pressure to continue to meet profit and there is a great deal of focus on morale within the individual organization.  We all know that change is inevitable while the way in which change is introduced needs to be approached differently.  Being able to speak intelligently to a situation is one thing while being able to put that into action is two different things; the company needs to hire based on that instead of friendships.  Friendship hiring does not work."
good,"Good management, products were best in industry, some items very negative. No smoking, dress semi formal, lose job if you received driving citation, yet with traffic, hard to make every appointment on time."
good,"Financial systems is about making the life of the accounting team a little bit easier. The FS team handles all financial software related concerns, from troubleshooting issues for team members, to monthly rollover. Other responsibilities include evaluating new changes in system based decisions, providing input on how the system will interpret an accounting change, and deploying financial software updates throughout the parent and child companies. However, one of the daily drivers of an FS team member is innovating or taking on self starter projects that are discussed and approved by team lead; in hope to increase efficiency in the current project and generate synergy."
good,Provided expert advice for e-filing consolidated tax return
good,Dover is a well run company. The AOP is always closely followed and there is little tolerance for not meeting numbers. It's a good company for stock and can be stressful but rewarding.
good,"The company grows through acquisitions and thus deals with a lot of different processes that are not robust.  The good thing is that over the last several years, the company has had a good push to share best practices over all of its individual operating companies and I believe it is seeing success.  The only problem is that there is not a great path for advancement as they typically hire talent from elsewhere instead of developing talent internally.  Also, the oil segment is very volatile and job security is questionable.  The people are great as well as leadership.  Like many businesses, they have their gripes, but I would consider this a good company to work for overall."
good,"At Riverside Florist, I would prepare flowers for arrangements, create small arrangement, create season decor, organize the dry cleaning, help customers, and run the register (on occasion). The job was enjoyable, with lovely staff members. The hardest part was having minimal training on the register, and with the arrangements."
good,The job site was clean and co-workers were very professional.  It was a nice place to work.
good,Loved working here. It is a well run organization with a value based focus that lends itself to people that enjoy progressive improvements and cutting edge technology.
good,Enjoyed very much my almost 6 years with Dover. So many thought leaders with whom I worked. The portfolio changes Dover continues to go through are hard for many people in the organization. The sometimes short-term cost control measures for a publicly traded firm also contradicted some of the cultural characteristics for which Dover strived to embody.
good,I was Manager of a good group of people. I ad a direct responsibility for quality training and implementation. I was relied on by my superiors to make the right choices
good,"I had a great experience working for Dover.  Executive management was accessible and very interested in developing the 'next generation' of leaders.  Workload was heavy at times, but I always felt like I was contributing to the overall performance of the company."
good,"After the registration process, they find jobs that match any skills or experience you might have. In addition to this, they offer training to update your skill which enables you to be more marketable."
good,Empresa equilibrada bom gerenciamento alguns benefÃ­cios e ambiente de trabalho bom
good,"This was an augmented support consultation position where I did such programming support as diagnosing and correcting errors in applications, fresh implementation and providing customization as per the client's requirement using the Enterprise One 9.2 toolset. Interacting with clients in terms of having a brief overview of their existing ERP, the needs/necessity for customization and having feedbacks during testing. Modifications to custom reports and development of new reports for distribution, manufacturing, inventory, logistics, sales order management, invoicing, and other modules. All in all a good place to work and I enjoyed my time there."
good,I loved it there. Absolutely no stress and fantastic management. I would go back in the future if i was not out of state now. Easy to get promoted within the company.
good,"It has been an amazing experience to work for a company that values leadership, integrity and ability to challenge status quo. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with the team and know that I make a difference everyday"
good,"Very greatful for this company!  Great wages (annual raises, profit sharing), awesome benefits (RRSP matching, HSA) and gave me an apprenticeship!  Great family environment, asides from a few minor inter-departmental quarrels and some management issues.  Overall very understanding and receptive to improvement ideas.  Unfortunately, due to industry (oil), recessions hit the company hard and layoffs had to be done.  Got laid off myself but everything turned out for the best.  Hope they pull through!"
good,Dover allowed a very autonomous style to engage your business.  Do what you say and delver results on your commitments and they let you run your company.
good,Great Company to work for. If you are not good with interacting with the public than it is not the place for you.A great an supportive staff that is like family
good,"At Dover Corporation I ahd the opportunity to know about their distinct segments and deepen into the automotive lifts segment where I could help with the importation, custom clearance, logistics, storage and deliver to the customer process, within the scope of after sales, where the manager let me free to solve any issue related to transportation or equipment maintenance.  "
good,"I worked as a clinical student. I learned from some great RPSGT technologist  how to read patient charts, Input information in computer, hook the patients up, monitor a PSG study, unhook patients and clean up process and end of study. The workplace was very pleasant and had a relaxed atmosphere."
good,It was nice working there it wasn't hard to learn the work it had a nice temperature while working all the people there was easy to get along with & they have a lot of assignment you can do
good,Very good place with high ethical standards and good work culture. Dover has 5 defined values which belief in excellence and helps individuals building leadership qualities.
good,"Dover corporate is a great company that takes care of each site.  high visibility with corporate Presidents.  Each site president manages site independently.  Corporate Presidents are best I have seen.  Site location: US Synthetic Review Great at lean manufacturing. Culture shifted to poor as the years continued.  need to be part of the ""good old boys club"" to advance your career.  Several managers are not qualified to manage people or have qualifications to run area.  Speaks for great culture, but has pockets of bad managers.  No management training at sight.  High employee empowerment and lowest level.  Pay and benefits were excellent, I'm not sure if they have changed in years past."
good,An fast growing company with great values and an entrepreneurial way of thinking.  Encourages out of the box thinking and supportive of their employees. Great work/life balance.
good,My position was entry level clerical.  I enjoyed the familial culture.  I was allowed to advance.  Dover was bought by Thyssen.  I enjoyed the Dover culture.
good,"Dover is as hands-off as they can be while still providing some support to their operating companies. For the most part, they allow the companies to maintain their individual identity/culture, while providing some support on the backend (like payroll and accounts payable) to smooth things out."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo.. buen horario y buen salario.. me quedarÃ­a si pudiese
good,Enjoyed the opportunity given me at Dover. Great bunch of people. Wished they weren't relocating company to Houston. 401K was a plus. Wish them well in Houston
good,"A typical day at work would be answering the phone and meeting new people."
good,"Enjoyed my time at Dow-Key Microwave in Ventura.  I had a great team, learned a lot about microwave products, helped to define the cross-division GTM strategy and worked in conjunction with the executive team on both growth and profitability strategies as well as how to continue to improve on the positive culture and organizational development."
good,"Ambiente agradÃ¡vel, "
good,"I have worked at Dover for a couple of years in a Human Resources capacity. If you are willing to pitch in, roll up your sleeves, and do what it takes to get the job done, the doors will open wide for you at Dover. Additionally, if you are open to travel and potential relocation in the future, there are even more opportunities available. "
good,Good group of guys to work with. Enjoyed the fast paced environment and location of job site. Hate that they had to relocate business. Glad for the opportunity they gave me to learn a new skill
good,I learnt to be a team member and did as I was told.i enjoyed talking to different clients when they came in to screen.i enjoyed helping different people.
good,A lot of growth opportunities because of constant growth in their business lines. Perks include expresso coffee machines and fully stocked fridge with favorite juices and sodas.
good,"Paramilitary organization that is a Flagship Calea Accredited Agency. Good working environment. Opportunity for advancement and multiple assignments such as motorcycle, horse, detective, crime scene."
good,Couldnt remove this from the resume when indeed inserted the company during download.  Tried many times to delete it but it deleted my entire work history when I tried to remove it

good,A typical day at work would consist of arriving in the morning and completing or loading orders that were ready to be sent out first thing that day then as the day progressed we would build more orders and prepare them to be shipped out
good,Fue una experiencia de corta duraciÃ³n pero que me ayudÃ³ a adquirir nuevos conocimientos en el Ã¡mbito laboral.
good,Workdays consisted of morning meetings with an overview of daily goals and necessary follow-ups.  I've learned to expect the unexpected as unknown claims could come up at any time.  The workplace culture was awesome because of the family oriented environment as we were extremely supportive of each other.  The most difficult part of the job was managing property and general liability claims which were unforeseen.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with such a professional and knowledgeable team.
good,good people and good atmosphere. plenty of part time hours. Lots of different types of work experience available in the constantly evolving and changing environment
good,"Uma grande empresa para se trabalhar."
