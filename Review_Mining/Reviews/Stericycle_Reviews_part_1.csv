rating,review
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,"Terrible place and terrible management  "
bad,The retention rate is terrible    You are forced out by pokicies that are designed for failure.  The managers and exec's do not care about the people.
bad,Employees are overworked and underpaid. There are quotas that can not be reached with the crippled staff consisting of half the number of men needed and intended to run the plant.  Management wont hire more workers and they completely run their employees into the dirt. No time off. They need to hire more people if they want the plant to run smoothly.
bad,The management does not care about your safety or your health. They will write you up over something small and petty. The company does not appreciate the employees.
bad,This is a call center. You answer for every kind of company imaginable. You can’t tell the caller you are an answering service or that you are in another city or state. Everyone that calls is mad and yelling. You have to pretend to be happy taking abuse. Then management reviews your calls and tells you everything you did wrong but never what you did correct.
bad,Don’t waste your time with a selfish company like this one is rather work at McDonald’s before I work for them ever again. They think they’re the boss of you.
bad,Treat employees unfairly and discriminante would not recomnebd ti anyone  managers are not helpful rules change from day to day and perjudice is all un the work place
bad,I had to resign my position due to a difference in opinions. The plant manager was very respectful and easy to get along with. The human resource department was hard to work for.
bad,I liked it in the beginning but after awhile of being there the mangers their especially on the floor supervisor vary rude and disrespectful always making derogatory comments about female employees there’s always yelling and throwing things as well as some of the leads there and they don’t do anything about it even when people say something
bad,"They run people in to the ground, you get %1 raise a year, they are very racist and they say they gonna do 1 thing and they change the next day to doing the opposite of what they say in meeting, they don't care about no-one but STERICYCLE they are a are cancer to the industry I feel sorry for anyone that still works with this company."
bad,They suck and allow employees to bully managers and HR and IT is remote no assistance I hated it there they shut the Jacksonville office and everyone works remote now and never get raises
bad,One of the best training programs for any call center job I have ever had. The trainer makes sue you are engaged and that everyone understands everything before moving forward.
bad,Ok job ..  They will fire you for your 1st accident. Had my 1st accident and 20 years 1st ticket in 20 years fired on the spot. Not the kind of place you can make a fortune for your self.  No job security.
bad,"This was one of the most stressful and misleading jobs that I have ever worked. It was a lot of craming, they leave you to figure out stuff on your own, have you doing work you didn't sign up for. They don't tell you that there will be a bunch of tests and if you fail one portion of the test three times, you're automatically terminated."
bad,"Stay very far away from this company.  They have never had an outside sales team, prior to the merger with Shred-it, and it certainly showed.  They cut all of our incentives and changed the bonus structure.  Terrible situation."
bad,Stericycle is a miserable and biased place to work they don’t he’ll there employees hr is useless and they will short u money any chance they get and if u have a complaint about management ur the bad guy
bad,Very disorganized company a true cluster no leadership nor direction no eligibility for promotion just a ground-level company. There's no future in that company.
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,Bad management and pay for the work that is done. Plant workers are treated poorly by management. Work conditions are very poor and hazardous because of the medical waste.
bad,"The good old boy network continued to dominate and no female was going to stand a chance is succeeding. The region I worked for was so far out of compliance and so incorrectly staffed with temps and not permanent employees, and it was allowed to be that way until I tried to make a change. Then I was forced out."
bad,Stericycle employees are completely unhappy and 95 percent of employees will tell you that the moment you walk through the door. Many look for new opportunities consistently.
bad,You are full time at 30 hours to make it you have to work 40 and that is considered overtime but they do not psy overtime toll you are past 40 hours but will not allow you to work past 40 hours. You are told one thing annd another happens. Favortism all around. Lead/supervisor talk about other employees with employees.
bad,"Poor leadership... extreme favoritism..."
bad,"If you have any desire to feel fulfilled or supported in any way, this is not the place for you.  They talk a good game, but don't deliver on any of their promises."
bad,employees here are just seen as a disposable asset. you could have made tons of money for the company and be considered the best among your peers but will still get cut on a moments notice if they feel like they can save a buck hiring someone less qualified
bad,"The company doesn’t appreciate the frontline team members, all they do is over delegate work from upper management down. This is by far the worst company I’ve ever worked for, on paper it’s Great but that’s a smoke screen. This company has leadership in place that doesn’t have a clue of employee engagement or realistic expectations as it relates to providing support. My prediction is this company will fold within 3 years. The stock is a clear indication of the value of this company and it continues to decline due to unorthodox processes and failure to follow processes. Upper management is indecisive with decision making and do whatever they can to protected there job. This company turnover rate is over 60% and these are real numbers. Lastly, the HR department considers themselves to be Business partners/ different entity and provide 0 support to anyone in need of support or counsel regarding issues."
bad,"Poor work environment, a lot of pressure and steres, poor pay and adverse conditions to do the job. Supervisors and managers have no control over the work and plan the routes very badly. The daily plan to be covered is not efficiently managed and professional ethics are lacking on the part of the superiors with their subordinates. Managers and other supervisors limit the over time to the employees to obtain an incentive bonus every year for saving hours affecting the quality of work and customers."
bad,"It was once a great place to work,  but local managers make it an uncomfortable place so most of the personnel gets fed up with management and move on ."
bad,this is the worst place I ever worked !!!   management lies and will put you in harms way...and if you do get hurt they will turn there back and leave you with the problem and then fire you !!!!!   STAY AWAY !!!
bad,"TO BAD I CAN'T HAVE NO STARS....As previous review stated horrible management, and if you are not apart of the ""click"" you are not liked.  If you have good work ethic and know more than them, this isn't the place for you.  "
bad,A real racist place to work. All the  managers  and other workers or racist. The managers will tell you to leave the waste if it not  package Correctly but as soon as the place you picking up call they will send you back out. And the waste is still not packaged and they tell you to package the waste. And there is so much racism going on it’s to many to list very bad place to work
bad,"Very upside down management has favorites, it’s definitely an environment where you kiss up to move up the ladder. Unfortunately, the number of minorities is shrinking in the sales role. Very few minorities alt have left due to unfair treatment. Minorities stay for a few years but the treatment is not same. Management do work on this start asking the VP why are we losing minorities during pow wow."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,The only good thing in this job was my co workers 1st they payed me 3 weeks late kept getting the run around 2nd I was lied about the what I would be doing in the job they told me only needles  well let me tell you that's a lie you will pick up body parts body fluids which leak all over you I was told you dont unload truck and you will if you got a depot set up on your route I was working 12 plus hour shifts and start time is 430/530am management has no clue what's going on  always lost
bad,"if someone got injured from acid, they would try there hardest not to have them go to the doctor so that they wouldnt get in trouble. it was 12 an hour so you have to work mega overtime if you are going to pay the bills.  and its outside work so its very hot or very cold alot of the time. we were instucted to re use our equipment because they refused to order more for us. was told i was going to be on day shift then moved to night shift on the same day. had to do a 17 hour shift."
bad,"I have nothing nice to say about Stericycle. If you can find some place else to work. Poor Management, people act like children, favoritism is shown. Work Environment is stressful."
bad,1st things 1st do not apply for a job here it will be the worst mistake you have ever made unless ur desperate! Management doesn't care about you ur safety or ur family! Oh you want a raise hahaha goodluck....I've been there 3 years and have only received $1.00 which totals .33 a year really sad!!! You could get a job at McDonald's and get paid more $$$. Absolute joke of a company that brags that they are a multi billion dollar company!!!
bad,This job only benefits those who have a relationship with someone in management.  Managers do not place employees with the job that best fits their experiences.
bad,"I had the opportunity to be employed at this organization for a year. It was by far the worst experience ever.  I received no formal training on the role or the products that my team was responsible for selling. This made it difficult to train my direct reports and sustain some consistency. There is a major gap in communication from the senior management team down to the sales reps. More often than not decision were made and the sales management team was never updated. The commission  compensation was explained incorrectly during the hiring/intervewing process. I asked two Directors for a break down on how commission pay was calculated and neither of them were able to provided a clear explanation. I never received a monthly 1-1 with my director during the first 10 months of employment to discuss performance or set goals even with me requesting time be set aside for it. After some company re-alignments I started reporting to another director. I realized this guy didn't have a clue as to what he was doing and couldn't be an effective leader. Our 1-1s consisted of what he felt I was doing wrong, rather than expectation setting. There was never any coaching provided, even with me asking for it, on how to move towards meeting and exceeding my personal and team goals. Instead it created a hostile work environment., The  director does a good job at cheering with the teams success, but passes the blame on their failures. In my years of sales leadership I have never seen such a poorly run company, There is absolutely no accountability in this organization. So glad to be gone from this"
bad,"Stericycle is the worst company I’ve ever worked for; I  was hired through Manpower and was informed that they would never ever lay us off or discontinue the  job. But after only three weeks of training, they decided that we were no longer needed for this company ( as we ask for an extra week of training due to the fact that we didn’t feel ready to take calls). Thiefr training department sucks, 7 trainers for 4 new hirers —- too many chiefs not enough Indians run in the company. &  once the new hires hit the four floor there was no backed up I have for them.  I would never ever recommend  this company for employment."
bad,"This company is a joke! they hire people but are out of the budget, how that's it works? Management is awful!, I was hired and I didn't receive any payment after 1 month and a half! and no one knew it the reason why I haven't been paid!"
bad,Incompetent management. Too many acquisitions to standardize. Confusion across all units. No one has a clue and they allow incompetent and lazy employees to remain.
bad,Stericycle is poorly structured by individuals who don’t consider their employees. The company is biased on management and allows management to mismanage employees
bad,"Company functions or gatherings were never planned and convenient for the field crew.  Field crew expected to be on call at all times for haz reponse calls.  The call out bonus was eliminated for response calls. Management does not openly listen for comments and opinions.  As a whole, their is no sense of loyalty to workers."
bad,This job is stressful and the management is lacking to say the least. I experienced a major life change and my manger did not attempt to accommodate me or my situation.
bad,they will be extremely rude and moan over the smallest things they cant  get it through teir heads that they need to be a little more considerate of their employees
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for. I worked with them for 1yr and 6 months! When I got hired I was promised so much that I did not see happen. They lie to you and then they treat you bad when you complain or ask about what your were promised! Management makes no sense, poor communication and no managing skills! There is only 2 of the team leads who are willing to help always but the rest SUCK!!! IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO APPLY HERE RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN AND DON'T!! THE WORST COMPANY TO WORK FOR!! They cut your hours once you get the raise of the one year review and then you are back to square one. I regret saying no to other companies just to go work for these people they are horrible!! Never worked for a company like this."
bad,Company did not care about its clients or employees. Why offer a service if you cannot provide it? I was ashamed at how some of our clients were treated.
bad,very under class management every manager is out for self and do not support you and team leader are just as worst............. its the hardest place to work and have a very high turn over.
bad,"I did not like it here in Dunkirk Ny, Stericycle here was a buddy, buddy type system, catering to their favorites....Hours cut short because of other drivers complaining theres no ot....they make sure the liked drivers get what they want."
bad,It was an awful job. The pay was very unprofessional and the people were rude and dramatic. The food was bad and the supervisors were never there when I needed help. 0/10
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,Strict & boring. Never knows when to brighten up the workplace. No one could eat on the floor unless you had special privileges or managers liked you. Favoritism at its finest
bad,"I started back in August 2017...the very first Call Center job for me Ever. I had such high hopes of making this a career. After 3 months on the job, i was asked to participate in the NHO-mentor training where i would initially assist with the new hire orientees. The job was thru a contractor and the goal was to get a certain amount of working hours (720) to be exact in order to be considered for conversion as Stericycle employee and to be ""at home agent"" eligible. Well, here i am putting in hard work, maintaining great quality scores, perfect attendance, and doing everything that was expected of me ...and then some. It is now March 2018, still no conversion, no possibility for becoming an at home agent. I was misled and lied to on the regular basically just to use me for additional services that there were no extra pay, no reprieves given. I am very discouraged and disgusted at this point, not only because i had strong beliefs that i can advance here, but because I too sat on a panel where i listened to the lies that were constantly told over and over to the new hires that come in to the company with strong expectations to advance. I feel sorry for the upper heads who stand by and send people off of false-pretenses. "
bad,"Biggest mistake of my career. Worked a month straight and wasn't paid, asked about my pay multiple times but then realized they were never going to pay me in the first place."
bad,The company was recently involved in a class action lawsuit for unethical practices towards its customers. This resulted in a mass RIFF and impacted hundreds of employees.
bad,"I only have two 8 hour shifts twice a week, only scheduled 32 hours a week. Managers allow certain people to work 40 hours a week, in order for me to see 40 hours I have to work 6 days a week. The only thing I like about this job is the ability to help the customers."
bad,"NEVER work here, the hours are all over, management don't listen to nothing and the company is broke, you are overworked and underpaid, you work ALL holidays and weekend and you are NOT appreciated for what you do!!!!"
bad,sterivycle is the worst company to work for especially as a Sharps Specialist! The management is a joke! the company only cares about themselves! If you are correct in the situation before termination they will still get rid of you! they dont train you! they will throw u out to the field with no help! i wouldnt recommend my worst enemy to this job!
bad,"Stericycle I thought focused on the environment, but just like every other company it was all about the money that management could make as well as save. Management happens to be the worst I ever had to deal with."
bad,"If you want to feel unappreciated, undervalued, yet do the work load of the entire call center then this is the place for you. Don’t expect to be paid well, have available time off for doctors appointments or sick days and don’t even think of being 5 minutes or less late to your shift EVERYTHING you do causes An occurrence against you so your job is always on the line. You have no voice, they only care about their bottom line and profits but not about the employees who take care of the customers. Without employees you have no clients. Smarten up stericycle honestly I wonder if companies who hire them even realize how horrible they treat employees"
bad,"Stericycle in Saint John for Directors choice is not a place I would apply too."
bad,"Está empresa tiene un pésimo desempeño laboral, es inmensa y a personal totalmente, no ofrece beneficios no esquemas atractivos para sus empleados, tiene un pésimo período de respuesta para sus clientes y empleados."
bad,This company was stinks there rate of pay  sucks and they don't have benefits for their employees. The management sucks and some of the employees sucks.
bad,They will run you raged. Then they will force Saturday work on you that you don't want. Lazy Warehouse staff to help you off load. They cant keep Management. They are leaving all the time. You are just a number.
bad,This company don't value their employees they don't care about there employees concerns. Just not a fun place to work. On a strict attendance point system.
bad,"I feel that this job is for students or people looking for a little extra income, do not put in full time there...they will work you to deaf for little pay!  "
bad,IWSS management is unfair at both program and regional level. Difficult company to work for as they constantly shift the goal posts with regards to job duties and standards.
bad,"The over all experience with Stericycle was the most unprofessional building that i have ever worked in, They are also very unorganized. The hardest part about the job is that you had to constantly move your desk and adjusting to the harsh environment"
bad,typical work day consisted of meetings that were not needed and only took you off the phone. Quota's were increased on a monthly bases based on how the team did as a whole. No consistent communication from upper management
bad,"Taking calls from customer who have purchased recalled items. Also calling businesses that have purchased recalled items, making sure they are aware of the recalls. I did not feel valued as an employee here."
bad,"This company is very prejudice against African Amercians, This company do not vaule their employees. The pay is awful. There is no room for growth and your under paid. Your overloaded with work its very stressful."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,i would not recommend to work for this company it was one of the worst jobs that I have ever had I worked 10 hours a day none stop and the manger were not caring about me they just wanted the job done at any cost even if you were sick I still had to go to work and the company was bad
bad,A circus act. Place is nothing but inexperienced liars and fakes. I worked for three different projects in 5 months because the clients was not satisfied with our work.
bad,"The manager was very discriminating person. Not welcomed diversity person, if you look different manager and some co-workers make fun of you and gossiping behind your back. After I worked hard  for my first day, while I was looking forward going going back, they send me message telling me not to comeback it didn't workout for you. They are soo bad company to work with."
bad,"Really bad company to work for, they will fired you for no reason.  When you ask a question to the supervisor they will play like they did not see you raising your hand or will ignore the phone when you are calling them. One of the top supervisor will play like she cares and every morning will be like good morning team , hows everybody doing, but in reality Noone cares there. And just now to make it worse there are bedbugs. If you go too many times to the bathrooms they will send you an email. Etc etc  I am still there but I am looking for another job, cannot wait to leave."
bad,The Stericycle had a very great introduction and training to make us excited to work for them. After we started working for at least a week they never wanted to give people chances for the attendance. example in an family emergency or death they will still count your strikes if you miss a day. if you miss 3 you can get fired no exceptions. I also noticed a lot of favoritism for the seniority workers than with the new workers.
bad,"If you don't want to get punctured with a contaminated needle or other sharps do not work in the plant! Very unsafe work practices are in place at the Garland, TX facility. This job is for someone who is very desperate for income."
bad,"The WORST ran company I have ever seen, equipment rarely works such as phones and other phone equipment , screens have gone blank while the Customer Service Rep is on the phone with the customer, quality scoring makes no sense, it is based on STRICTLY FOLLOWING A SCRIPT , no room to treat the customer as a person, perpetuated dialing to customers whom clearly said ""DO NOT CONTACT ME ANYMORE!!! "
bad,"Very fast paced job you won`t even  get time to take lunch. They have a program called road net which tells you when you should get to each stop, how long you should be there,   and how long the route should take for the whole day. You have to be superman here to get the route done when road net says so. Hours start very early 430 am and can end 700 pm.. Upper management could care less about the employees, all they do is sit in front of computer and watch your every move on your scanner. Coworkers are good people, friendly and hard working. Don't waste your time here, look elsewhere."
bad,"A typical work day consists of a 9 hour day with minimal pay, understanding and concern for human life outside of the workplace."
bad,"The turnover rate is probably why hours are so flexible. I honesty have nothing say that is even relatively close to ""Good"" about this company. I've been here for almost 5 years and not even a single cent raised in my paycheck. The ""PROS"" are you're ""PROGRAMMED"" like a robot to accept a ridiculous ""One team one Goal"" attitude. It's very sickening. And of course those who love this company, are the ""favorites"". If you work here, you might as well be working at a high school, excluding any individual thought process of course."
bad,"This company was ok to work for. However, the communication process was extremely poor and the management team was not united. A lot of miscommunication and inconsistency."
bad,"Stericycle hired over 50 + employees under false pretenses. We were hired for one position and placed in a lower level position with out prior discussion. Many people gave up their jobs, or other job opportunities based on the misleading information provided by the company. This deception has caused several people their jobs and has impacted most of the new hires in the last few months."
bad,Hard work and low pay with lying management makes for an unpleasant working environment. Best advise is keep looking for other work as this place is a bad place to be.
bad,"New management needed asap!!!!! They are disrespectful, inconsistent, lazy, and down right no good for any company!!!! Please, do not apply!! If you do, be sure to ""not"" make a career of this horrible place!!!! There is no one in the company that you can trust, so if you have any issues that upper management has to handle, be prepared to find yourself another place of employment, because they will not take any responsibility for their actions...Terrible place of business!!!!!"
bad,the company is ok. if you work in the office is ok. as a field tech good luck. you will regret it for the rest of your life. people continue to quit. they are desperate they cannot keep people.. simply put the office in Houston is a disaster..
bad,"This job is very nasty and dangerous! I have seen babies,body parts, AIDS patients blood! Some containers weigh up to 300 pounds!"
bad,Worst upper management and HR. California HR doesn't understand the word confidentiality.  Stay away from this region to work for.
bad,promised fulltime employment & was not able to get fulltime company made promises they could not keep.  Did not have the contract they claimed to have
bad,"Management had no clue what was going on at any given moment."
bad,Not a very good company to work for. Upper management is horrible with communicating to their employees. Everything is un organized
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,I was a route driver for this company out of Gary Indiana for 3 years and let me tell everybody don't waste your time they don't care of the employes only of making money I hat lots of problems waste not ready so you need to close and tape boxes full with blood and body parts animals and they smell really bad and if you got a problem with any custumers you need to solve the problem your self management don't care about nothing and they will tell you the time you need to be punch in and out they will give you  20 stops and be out of the clook like in 7 to. 8 hrs you will have gps on your truck and hand held or pdt the don't like the truck to be idle so on winter it gets real cold and on summer real hot inside those trucks they will know if you are idle cuz they have a computer inside the truck all i have to say is f***k this company don't work for a company that don't appreciated your hard work
bad,"Tiny paycheck hourly rate Supervisor in call center is abrasive and horrible chain smoker. The employees work while shes out smoking or eating (shes very large)"
bad,"sad, low pay and no opportunity for advancement waste of time."
bad,"The place needs NEW MANAGEMENT and a NEW LOCATION along with Professional employees. There is no advancement within the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with some of my co-workers who viewed this place as the same as me and also some really nice TEAM LEADERS who DESERVES so much more. Most importantly, the pay fits for someone who is working there part time and someone who is fresh out of high school. The location is horrible at night. Was always AFRAID to deal with the REAL issues of the employees. ALWAYS allowed the Team Leaders to do what they wanted and never disciplined them even knowingly they were in the wrong and also ALLOWED them continued employment even finding out that MARIJUANA was in the building."
bad,Cons--Had to take a hepatitis shot /dealing with medical waste/heavy labor they said in job description must be able to lift 55 lbs .some weighed over 150 you will get injured with the repetition heavy lifting. I'm glad I left..and if u speak up management will let you go..people come and go at this place..
bad,I worked for this company for a very long time....a few years ago new management came in and destroyed what was once a wonderful place to work....they filled the executive chairs with men who were clueless to the business and more concerned about their next vacation then insuring the company was successful and their employees were happy.
bad,Co-workers generally helpful and lovely people.
bad,"I was a stericycle employee for 4 years. I was transferred from one location to another. The management team at this company go off of feed back from others without getting to know. At times, they talk and dont know what they are talking about, but they expect you to know if all when you are suppose to perform the job. The management team as most companies, has their favorites and not so favorite empolyees that they choose from. If the manager doesnt like someone, they will simply set you up and you will lost your job. Your time at this company doesnt mean anything."
bad,"The Jacksonville, FL location management team is the worse. Unprofessional leadership, managers yell at employees, the office is dirty and the work environment is very stressful. This office has roaches and fleas, phone system used to speak with patients is terrible (you have to raise your voice constantly in order for the caller to hear you) and training does not exist. This office does not have a formal training class for new employees at all. When hired you sit with other employees that do not know how to train or uphold the company name in a positive manner. Most employees yell and talk to patients anyway they choose to and management does not redirect. How can they.... they do the same thing to their employees. Management does not have a professional cell in their body. This location needs someone from corporate to come in and clean it up and out...starting with the carpet/desk and spraying for pest, all the way up to management. Why did I leave this position? I left my shift one night, arrived home and noticed I had two fleas on my pants from sitting at the desk at this job. NASTY NASTY"
bad,"Cyanide spills, explosions, rumors and back stabbing all a part of normal life at Stericycle do not work there, management is incompetent and salaried employees are expected to work 11+ hours a day"
bad,"This location is such a poorly run facility, to the fact you never will have the same boss for 1 year or more. Stops will get switched so the pm manager can leave. Treated poorly, always short staffed and customers are always unhappy."
bad,"When the Vice President of Customer Operations, and sometimes IT, says, ""I am getting really good at this lying stuff"", that is a good indication you are working for the wrong company.  Stay away from this company unless you really, really, really need a job."
bad,Working at this company has been a struggle as the company does not provide successful tools for its employees.  The computer and phone systems seem to have issues on a weekly basis.  I have realized the opportunity for advancement was non existent unless I was willing to move to another state.  Management always talks about helping its employees succeed but that is FALSE.  There is a Quality Assurance department who seeks out your mistakes when talking with customers as all calls are recorded.  Heck if you sneeze or cough you get points taken off from your overall score.  The immediate co-workers are friendly and can make the job manageable.  It is a fast pace environment which is great but if you don't follow the set processes or procedures you get penalized for it.  The salary range is below market and since its a big company you are just a number and not a person.
bad,Stericycle's new culture and atmosphere is absolutely toxic and the company is going down quickly. They no longer care about their employees or the reputation they once had.
bad,Would  not recommend this job to anyone..management  has no clue what is going on and ate very two face...human resource will also talk nice to your face and back stab.
bad,"Horrific work environment. Management had favortism and nepotism problems. Favorites did as they please, despite multiple coworker complaints. I've witnessed other employees speak up about mistreatment from coworkers just to have it blow up in their face later on sometimes months down the line. It never seemed to be a matter of accuracy, devotion, determination or hard work but always who you knew."
bad,"It's a trash place to work. Management messed with my hours on ADP. I was harassed and retaliated against for making a complaint about a fellow co-worker making fun of clients disabilities. I was also made fun of for working a lot of overtime (lazy slobs). It was just super ghetto environment; from management to the poorly-housed trained animals you have to work with, it's just not worth the $16 an hour they'll throw at you."
bad,Expect zero support from any of the managers. There is so much drama going on that you will struggle to complete your job daily.  Environmental spills and accidents are an everyday occurrence.  Safety takes a backseat to everything else
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,"management is so unprofessional and the ironic thing is that they expect others to be professional when they themselves are not leading by example. They have several meetings with HR who was hardly ever available to come in because of the morale in the work environment. They go over the basic things such as no gossiping, not creating a tense work environment, don't be late Etc you know the basic things that all employees should know. But they themselves gossip with their own employees about other employees. It is a complete circus and creates an environment where you don't even want to come to work at all I was working there for years. years almost a decade the work itself was not physically hard but the environment was so negative so unprofessional such an embarrassment to work at that I wanted no parts of it at all anymore. When I started my new job I almost forgot what it was like to work in professional respectful environment and I absolutely love it! I would never recommend anyone working at the facility I worked at. I'm sure it may not be like that at other stericycle locations so I don't want to write a biased opinion but at the particular facility I was at it was a complete embarrassment. They don't do anything about the troublemakers they say the write them up but they don't ...they tell them to stop gossiping but the employees don't because the managers are doing it themselves I've even heard them gossiping with other managers about another manager. It's like high school all over again. When I come to a job I come to work to be professional to be an adult to give customers"
bad,"Company lacks management, overworked, company believes that even when you off, you must be available or you will be reprimanded.  While assigned to the ER Team, the rest of the company was unable to complete their day to day pickups, so instead they were outsourcing to other companies to complete the waste pickups.  If you get hired on as a client manager, you should be good.  The company bends over backwards for client managers."
bad,"It's depressing to work there, frankly. Management is totally disconnected from their workers. There is no communication, no training, no paid time off, no sick time, no benefits, no stability, no job security, no consideration. When you make suggestions for improvement, if you even get a response, you're likely to be told ""that's just how we do things, get used to it."""
bad,Poor Management with lack of communication skills and commitment to employees. Additional duties will be assigned that are not in your current job role. Pay grade  will be 13.00  with no annual raises. Poor work environment which will include working outside daily.
bad,"This place was/is garbage!! Management had no clue what was going on in that place. There were all kinds of environmental issue, such as the chemically saturated ground around the warehouse, and the overall appearance of what was suppose to be the warehouse. Place overall was a train wreck!!"
bad,"With trucking jobs on the rise, you'd Think that employers would change & Actually show compassion for others."
bad,"dirty and nasty place to work. Never got off of work on time, No good management, It always took 9 to 12 hours for a crew of six men to unload six to eight trucks. Most co-workers and the shift manager (2nd Shift) would screw around and drag out loads as long as possable to ""make more money"" instead of doing their job and be able to get out of work on time. I don't mind overtime when stuff breaks and you have to do a little OT to catch up, but OT every night    because of lazyness is way to much!!!"
bad,"Stericycle is highly enethical and those that are good at lying and fleecing customers will do well here.  This mentality is filtered down from management."
bad,"Ive been with this company for about a year and a half, its has gotten worse and has to be the worse job ive ever had , Bad management , they care nothing about the employees , its all about the money and getting more done , if you have a problem with customers there is no customer support or any support from management , you are left out in the cold to deal with everything on your own, everything is based on management getting a bonus so the employees are forced to work  10 - 12 hr shifts , Def cant wait to find better employment"
bad,Terrible Work Culture. The turnover rate was atrocious while they didn't give any raises. They only way you received a increase if you sucked up the hardest to management.
bad,"The place is not clean, I always stayed sick with something that someone came to work with. That is all I have to say about the Company. Better enviro"
bad,"Temp position that started out as 8 hours a day on the weekends, changed to 12 hour days. Questions went unanswered by management. The management and coworkers were very unorganized."
bad,"Poor place to work, under compensation, poor management. Bosses more worried about their bonuses at year end. Poor training."
bad,This place is a joke. The turn over is outrageous yet the loyal employees that actually stick around get paid way less than new hires. Example: a team leader that has been there for 7 years is making LESS than an operator that just starts. They keep adding to the workload but not the paycheck
bad,"hard to make money with the leads you assigned each month, most of the people you call have either been Stericized by prevous reps for years or they know their worst nightmare is signing an agreement they can't get out of. Managers aren't on the floor enough to help you and rely on systems and metrics to track your every call, computer punch and down to the second how long your ""logged in"" every day."
bad,"physical job, must pay attention to detail,such as proper routes to take and amount of time to load and unload truck. Most customers easy to deal with."
bad,Horrible place to work for. The company says they are a family but all they care about is themselves and not the employees.
bad,This place is the pits the mangers are childish and the pay sucks. They half train you. I HATE IT. Run people!!!!!!!!!!!  This place is the worst.
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,"My experience was horrendous. I was continously mistreated and was never acknowledged for the 2 and a half years of hard service I gave to that job.  I ALWAYS worked looking over my shoulders because unless you are a brown nosing cucumber sucker, they looked for any reason to put you down and kick you out of the door.  The union is unsupportive, uninspiring and lack dedication to their members.  The pay is ABSOLUTELY garbage.  The pay for this physical a job should be a minimum of $15 per.  The medical coverage is the ONLY bright spot, Blue Cross Blue Shield was great for my family and I but that's the end of the good stuff.  The working conditions, especially for the overnight crew, is borderline unhealthy and incredibly brutal especially in the winter months.  I professionally and personally advise everyone to avoid this job and company as a whole.  If you have a family, don't even look back, this job has nothing to offer men or women with children. This is probably best suited for high school students or maybe recent graduates looking to make some short term cash.  In my 17 years in the work place, Stericycle was leaps and bounds my all time worse experience.  You've been warned. Good luck."
bad,"If you would like to work for a company that actually values their employees, this is not the company for you.  The managers place their employees safety at risk daily in order to make more money.  The morale of stericycle is low because managers do not consider the needs of their employees.  Cut throat and deceitful methods are exercised  by managers in order to get tasks done."
bad,"Unless your family or up a supervisors bu tt you will go no where in this job and be treated like cr ap. team leads fall asleep while at work and are aloud to keep their job, along with being promoted to other departments. The hiring manager wears sweatpants and slippers to work. management holds open interview for team leads and to move up in the company but its just for show. they hire their sisters or childhood friends. Maybe if they fired 98% of the management and started over it would get a 4 star rating"
bad,Management is uneducated and discriminates his employees. Regional manager will cover his lies to human resources and corporate office.
bad,"I work for stericycle as a CDL Class A driver, very low pay, they don't take care of there equipment. pickup medical waste"
bad,"The problem with working at Stericycle is the Customer Service Management team. The Directors, Managers and Supervisors of Customer Service have the worst work ethic I've ever encountered!"
bad,They are a horrible to work for . They did me so badly yet I worked so hard for them.
bad,Raicism and micromanaging at the Concord California location is terrible! Was Lied to on a Ride Along by my manager what a terrible company to work 4.
bad,Terrible working conditions they have you unloading wagons of hospital waste bins then u have to push them 50+ meters across a floor that's slanted all different directions and full of big pot holes so its sometimes extremely difficult to get the bins where you want them to go and there not light either you need to push 4+ 100kg bins at one time just so you can keep up with the wagon driver  the shifts are soul draining  12 hours at minimum wage
bad,Very bad equipments the trucks breakdown everyday  very disorganized. It's a good  company but very bad management I would not recommend someone to this lousy company
bad,"Over worked and tired because If you call out to take a day off, you get threatened about your job and possible job termination by my current manager. So don't recommend this job unless you deal with awful smell and awful management."
bad,"Stericycle has no work life balance. company has no standardization. Company continues to add daily duties but doesn't want to increase pay.   Employees wait all year long just to get a .55 cent raise. Company valves wrong employees. Company will look to outside before promoting within, but expect you to train them. Company in Norcross is ran off the good ol boy system. Leadership is a joke. Everyone talks to you crazy in the company. Core valve you is Accountability, but no one is held accountable for anything. Everyone so quick to point the finger. Upper management doesn't know how to interact with diverse back ground."
bad,"It's horrible. They give you vacation time but never approve time off, then at the end of the year tell you to use it or lose it by March but still never approve your vacation. The managers talk to you as if you're children and upper management doesnt care enough to follow up. Its your word against the manager.  being in prison"
bad,"Other employees were great, management & supervisors sucked, it refused to do anything to upgrade systems.  Getting anything done from management was like having your nails pulled"
bad,"They claim to one team one goal....lies all lies backstabbing company made me leave my dying father claiming i would lose my job when i had 35 paid off time hours..terrible terrible people think its okay to abused daily by their disgusting callers...watch out for iinternal witch hunts....had a stroke while on the phone...with their callers.....terrible, made me leave my dying father..disgusting"
bad,"Your day can start between 0430 and 0800 and can/will change depending on how the manager wants to bend you over. Graft like a dog dragging bags around buildings. Up and down stairs in and out of lifts-if they work. "
bad,Management is terrible. Treated drivers terribly and forced overtime every day. Supposed to be 4 day work week but never got it. Ever. Had to report management to HR in order to get relief. Was asked to come in while off for the birth of my first child. I was only allowed 5 days off when my child was born (had 13 days available). Tried hiring CDL drivers at $13-14/hr
bad,easiest job I've ever had just terrible management would still be working there if it wasn't for the bad management skills along with 5 other guys they lost the last 2 months
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,"Protect Your Business with Safe, Reliable Medical Waste Disposal. Get a Quote! Easy Mail-back Solutions. Easy Scheduling. The Industry Leader. Compliance Experts. Online Customer Portal. Nationwide Service."
bad,"Stericycle was a great company when I started but since has become a place where many must go not where many want to go. Also, many walks by each other and will not speak nor acknowledge the other even after one has said Good Morning. The commander has just gone out the door. Sad to see."
bad,"INSANE PACE better at night, at the plant I worked at the manager AL was disrespectful, ugly and treated the plant workers as if they were all criminals and totally beneath him. Most other plant workers did not like anyone who was not fluent in Spanish."
bad,"When they bring you in for your walk through- everybody seems in great spirits, everything runs great, looks to be just peachy. However they are cruel. You are expected to build 25 carts of hospital material in a quarter or verbally harassed if you don't. They tell you how you're allowed to 'feel' and film you if you don't smile and claim you don't enjoy your job. You are easily wrote up for insubordination when you haven't done anything to deserve it. Attendance policies pertain only to those they wish them to pertain to. The know when inspections come- they hustle to clean up, put on a show for agencies, then resume back to unsafe work practices once they've left. You will be poked by a needle at one point or another. They talk to you like you're a toddler."
bad,"Very unprofessional work environment clouded by nepotism that ran through all aspects of the chain of command."
bad,Operations manager is never there. There is no support for the warehouse supervisor allowing all warehouse staff to do what they want. Employees don't show up most days or call in sick all the time. There is no recognition for going above and beyond in this company even though they expect overtime hours to be put in. Management can not make up their minds about where waste is to go causing warehouse staff to make up multiple sets of paperwork for one load. Complete mismanagement on their part!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"Management runs the warehouse based on favoritism.  Promotions mainly given to males whether qualified or not. They DO NOT listen to team members issues. They will lie to you and tell you what you want to hear then do something completely different. Rarely do the ""good"" employees acknowledged unless you are part of the in group."
bad,"This company parades itself as a company with core values and an appreciation of employees... this is (to put it plainly) a lie. "
bad,"Stressful, inconsistent, I learned how to operate salesforce, Management had no direction, this job was a pilot, nice environment as far as the co workers, the hardest part of the job was making the sale of the unuseful product, interacting with people over the phone."
bad,The bosses have no clue how to talk to people and put u on a time frame to get stops done. Everyday is a different day so things change so if u fall behind on a day that u did faster the week before you will get twenty questions on what went wrong. If u think this job is for u and u want to be talked down like your a little kid then this job will be good for u and always remember that anything that goes wrong even though u didn't do it u will always get blamed. Good luck
bad,"This is a very hard company to work for. Long hours, HEAVY HEAVY LIFTING. Your being timed on every stop, you only have a certain amount of time to do the pick up and delivery. You get about 15 to 18 stops a day. If you go over the time in each stop they will question you. You are on the move all day, you don't even have time for lunch. Very smelly and dirty job. You pick up 90 pound barrels, sometimes they are leaking blood or other medical waste. This is not an easy job, very stressful and heavy. Too much work for the wages paid."
bad,"I worked in the Itasca location. The management is laid back to the point of being unprofessional and they will not go to bat for their drivers, against upper management and HR. If you aren't a 100% motivated Stericycle suck up, you are marked. They do not harp on times when you start, but after a few weeks, they want you to be keeping up with their ROADNET, computer program, which dictates what your travel and service times should be, on a daily basis. If you are a driver, you have probably heard of ROADNET. If you do not mirror the dictated times, you are removed."
bad,"Expect back stabbing associates and a weak management team. They don't need to be good because the ""shady"" business model keeps customers, prisoner. As a sales rep, you're simply getting practice managers and nursers to sign an ""agreement"" that constantly increases (without reason) and is close to impossible to get out of... after five years. NOTHING feels or is good about this job. Sorry but, any idiot can work for Stericycle. It was a great idea back in the 80's but became compromised by greed and weak leadership. STAY AWAY!"
bad,"I've worked there for several months.  You'll walk minimum a day 15 miles.  Unloading straight trucks of medical waste and loading it into 18 Wheelers."
bad,"I could only take it for 6 months.  Was put in Retention.  OMG.  If it wasn't for the lead in that dept I would have been gone much earlier.  They record every call you make and have another dept just to grade calls to make sure you are following the script to a T.  I have been in sales for 10 plus years both Inside and Outside.  This was the WORST experience I have every had.  I am sorry to say that  the ""Managers"" are a joke.  "
bad,"Answer calls to different offices and hospitals , relay messages to offices and doctors, take messages for law offices, dental offices and other various companies"
bad,They fire you for no resons at all. They lets you go before you make it to your three mouth. They are not fair with you. And management are racist. I was let  go for no reasons. I was fire over the phone. And with out a meeting to hear my side of the story. My night boss was on fair to me is name is Charle. He got me fire for no resons at all. Because he did not like me. He say I walk out the job when I did my 8 hours.
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of being at the hospital site by 6am and using 5- 3 shelf carts with clean sharps containers and swapping out with the dirty in all rooms and departments throughout the entire hospital. I learned alot of skill, although mainly on my own due to management never being around or ever answering phone calls, texts, emails for questions. I only had one co-worker but, he worked an hour away at a different site which we never really saw one another except for phone calls to see what supplies i would receive. I had a hard time with the company due to a shortage of supplies every single day and they had me use my own personal vehicle to pick up clean and dirty containers as well, which made me furious. I had to lie alot to our customers everyday about being able to supply them with supplies, when i had not enough. Job was great and meeting the people was also great but, they company made me hate my job."
bad,"Manager is passive/aggressive. 2 month inn expect to be grilled if not before. No training available worth speaking about. Learn on your own in a highly regulated environment. Loose an account and you are good as done. Overpriced bids will come to your demise. Most customers angry at service, price, and inconsistency. Stericycle is out of touch with employees, the market, and customer. Will do anything to gain business unethically even to the point of acquisition. It's the only way Stericycle growth is sustained. If that's enough manager will inquire and arrive at decisions based from other employees while other attempt to steal your accounts right in front of your face. No shame or moral compass."
bad,I worked at Stericycle for 5 years. I was on call 24/7 for the last 3 years that I worked there due to the fact that they are severely understaffed in their maintenance department and under paid as well. For the first 3 years the management was great then we got a new regional manager and it changed everything. People were passed up for promotions and some people were fired because of who they as far as appearance. Several employees have been fired due to following instructions that they were given then told that they broke the rules. I was fortunate enough to find a new job and love it. It got so bad that 38 employees filed a petition against the regional manager for what he had said and done to employees and nothing was done and now he is on a rampage. The maintenance manager has been fired 2 lead men and now the rest of the maintenance department. So if you apply just be careful.
bad,"Stericycle sets goals that can't be meet by the employees. Upper management says they care about the employees but they really don't, also they are always looking for ways to make your job harder even though they say it should make it easier."
bad,"Very stressful environment with unrealistic expectations."
bad,"Don't bother with this company. You find out things during the phone interview (changes in the company) that will dissuade you from wanting to join. Most of the employees that I saw had a dull, lifeless look in their eyes and simply seemed stressed."
bad,"Says 4 × 10 schedule when applying, 90 percent of the year we were so understaffed it was a 5 × 11 schedule. Very stressful job, slightly underpaid for the material being hauled, but dont worry theres 10 hours mandatory overtime every week. The management is absolutely terrible, and the company itself has a money first, everything later culture. Employees are assets and nothing more."
bad,"This is hands down the worst environment I have ever worked in. Management is terrible from the top on down. The office is filled with a bunch of grown women acting like high school children complete with cliques, backstabbing, sabatoge, and finger pointing because no one wants to take responsibility for themselves. Pay is terrible for the amount of work expected, and any raises promised won’t be paid out. HR will call that “teachable moments for Management “. A few people in the office work hard while the majority socialize and slack off all day. Benefits available are all high deductible, so you will have insurance but won’t be able to afford to use it. Zero opportunity for advancement."
bad,"Management is horrible & petty in the Shred-it division. Company consolidated the entire customer service and phone center so customers can't even reach the local branch. Hostile, unprofessional and insensitive workplace. Pay was ok for the work."
bad,"All went down hill while the company bought shred it and management took over, the management had no clue about our medical waste and they were all about favoritism and didnt follow the stericycle policies. Management is very rude and disrespectful to employees, i was laid off due to not having personal time left, even though i was out on FMLA and hurt on the job!!! I wouldnt recommend this company to anyone unless Stericyle gets rid of Shred it and their management team !!!"
bad,"Horrible management, not treated fairly. They hired anyone just for labor reasons. They don’t care about there customers, just the bottom line. You are not going to have good customer service this way."
bad,Stericycle is a fake. They say they have great benefits aa far as vacation ect and its bs. They never approve any time off. They find ways to not give raises even when you are doing the job of ten people. If you are thinking about applying dont move on. Run fast
bad,"The new location is very nice. Offers large breakroom with self checkout store, pool table, gym and filtered water stations."
bad,This is a place where the supervisor skims money off the petty cash and complains about the employees getting over time . I thought it was a good place to work at first until I started seeing that the supervisor could manipulate the boss. They had me doing special jobs at other locations out of town in my own vehicle which wasn't in my job description and laid me off because the 3rd job I was asked to do I asked for gas money.
bad,"I've been an employee in the call center with this company for over a decade. They don't provide any growth  or advancement opportunities. There are unfair pay increases or lack there of.  There motto is ""One team one goal"" when it's nothing like that at all.  In my opinion this location has LOW MORALE IN THE WORKPLACE."
bad,"HR lied to hire and then denied their lies once we were brought in and looked to have the schedules and job duties discussed in the interview. They are a very unethical organization in many ways. The call center itself is crowded and unorganized...The energy of the entire place is very negative and inappropriate. If you are sensitive to nonsense or you have any decency, this place may offend you."
bad,"Seems great to be able to have a home office and work from home?  Well think again, you are on the road driving your personal vehicle 4 days a week driving hours on end.  On top of that, you have loads of paperwork to do and think about doing that after spending five hours a day on the road!"
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,"Basic Job Description(s):"
bad,"Worked as a Temp. Was hired to do inside sales. Was told would be hired in 3 -6 months, A FLAT OUT LIE!. They spent a lot of money training me, but once I hit the sales floor, it's every one for themselves. Had enough basic info to perform the job, but was shortly asked to work in a more advanced dept. Had zero training in the new department, and after a week of learning the basics of the new role, was left to the wolfs. If you don't like ripping off retirement homes, vets offices, or any other place that produces medical waste, DO NOT WORK HERE! In order to make your set sales quota, YOU MUST DOUBLE EVERY QUOTE you send out, just to get close to keeping your job. And since the only way to make quota is to send out Quotes for way over what the program recommend, Management will call you out! So if they like you, they leave you alone. If they do not, you will know it! Management is a ""click"", and if they don't like you, they will ride you every day! I was shocked that upper management doesn't place more pressure on the sales managers to assist their staff. As I said, its everyone for themselves! They have the best sales staff I have ever worked with, with the WORST management I have ever worked with. Lots of Brain Damage. Stay away!  And one last thing, the team leads know 10 x's more than their managers, but if you didn't work for Quill before coming to Stericycle, YOU WILL NEVER BE PROMOTED!!!!!"
bad,Health risk period. No one cares about you but yourself. It's just a job not a career.
bad,"I was constantly harassed treated disrespectfully and unfairly because of my orientation. "
bad,"Stericycle only cares about the bottom line.  Hand held devices track and time your every move.  Camera in truck watches you constantly. Your statistics are used to pit you against other drivers. They keep you on edge all the time. And they closed the warehouse location in our town and laid everyone off.  Now drivers from Kent have to drive 90 miles just to start our former routes. On the other hand, coworkers were nice and the trucks are fairly new so it was enjoyable to drive around in them."
bad,They will not give you the supplies you need so you get yelled at all the time by the hospitals and then you tell them you need them and they want to fire you from your job the management dose not care about you they will get rid of you for no reason and put some else for less money. They do not pay you enough for what you have to do and put up with.
bad,"Please see resume it is very detailed in regards to my job duties, if there is anything specifically you would like to know please ask me directly and I would be happy to answer any specific questions that you have for me, I am very open and straight forward in a honest and loyal way."
bad,No loyalty to it's team members.  Upper management is trying to hold onto their jobs.  Lie to you but you cannot lie to them.  Middle management is terrible due to the fact that the company is in trouble.  Walked in and terminated a whole section when it suits them.  Then realizes it made a mistake and starts hiring again.
bad,"If you want to work at Stericycle,  you will absolutely become that proverbial ""just a number"" person. After 10 years so much has changed. The little guy gets blamed for major mishaps by management. Zero respect for the common worker, and they will can you faster than your head can spin. This used to be an ok place to work. But upper management has destroyed this company. AVOID..."
bad,"They decided to utilize a no code approach to complicated processes and thus, fired all the developers except one.  This failed miserably. Now they are looking for a new team."
bad,"Micromanagement, all management suffer from a superiority complex. People were getting let go every day for the most miniscule things. I never felt valued as an employee, I would never recommend anyone to work there."
bad,"this is a high risk job with no pay to go with the work you load you have to handle . picking up dirty medical waste and playing part time scientist cause you have to figure out what chems your picking up this is 15 dollar an hour job and its starting pay should be 45+ dollars an hour trust me dont even think about applying here its a waste of time"
bad,"The company's motto ""one team, one goal"" is a laughing stock. The company's shady practices of having automatic price increases has caught up to them. Management does not know what they are doing, sales goals unrealistic."
bad,My co workers were great but the managers were very unethical.  I could do the same as the guys but told me I was not and my log books and paperwork showed different but still wasn't good enough for them. Seen how they treat some of the plant workers and many would quit.  We were always short handed in transportation and plant.
bad,"Used to care about its employees but not anymore. We were first before customers. Too busy expecting perfection. More concerned about stats than people and customer service. You are not allowed to make mistakes at all. Even if you catch it, it will still counts against you. Paid for one job but expected to do 2. Things that are beyond your control count against you."
bad,Stericycle does not meet the expectations of their Core Vaules. They do not take good care of their employees. I can remember sitting in a tornado warning and sirens was sounded. Everyone evacuated but my department the work was more important than the employees.
bad,I witnessed and reported other employees stealing the company's merchandise. They acted as if this was all okay including the management team. i found this very unprofessional and unethical because the company is suppose to keep the employee safe.
bad,"I did not enjoy one day at this job, we dealt with blood, needles, and all other hospital tools that were sharp and soiled in patients blood etc. it was ran very poorly and unfair towards employees."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,While working her I have come to find that when you do your job well they give you more work until you have become over worked to the point that you continually fail and only once you fail are they doing anything about it. When they do anything about they are pointing the finger at the employee that they are the one who is wrong and messed up. Very bad management/leader training for this company. This the leads to failed employee jobs.
bad,"not intersted in sharring more but a horrible place to work                                             i was constantly unhappy, poor productivity metrics, horrible product mix."
bad,I did not enjoy working for this company. The pay was minimal and there was not any room for advancement. The managers picked favorites. There was also no benefits offered for contracted employees nor for hire on's. Overall a bad work experience
bad,I did not mind the job I did it for 2 years the managers are Micro Managers I've just came  to do my job and go home they would find things wrong to protect their jobs when I started the job they said no weekends then they tried forcing weekends told me 1 to two overnights a week they stress one team one goal not at all I was out four nights a week I do not recommend that place at all
bad,no a good work place..not good management discimanation. It has very bad supervisor there that are very disrespectful to and do not care abouot your feeling
bad,"0 management ethics"
bad,"Stericyle owns the medical waste disposal business. No other company is a close second. Because of this, they not only overcharge for their services, they use deceptive tactics in getting customers to sign long term agreements and then STILL increase their rates TWICE a year! When they call in to complain, inside sales role is to ""save"" the account by offering token decreases in exchange for re-setting the contract length and the cycle repeats intself every few years. Most customers would leave in a heartbeat if they had a realistic alternative. Not fun to be in sales and spend all day having doctors and office managers calling in irate. Stericyle makes big $$$, and that's all they care about. Sales department turnover is like a revolving door."
bad,"Northeast RVP was inadequate and majority of upper management do not understand their own business.  They need to invest in the business units that actually make money, cut loose EVS"
bad,Nepotism is very prevalent in this company. Constant change is the norm. There are some really good workers there that are not being cultivated and developed for other roles in the company such as leadership roles.
bad,Hours are decent but the pay is horrible especially for the work you do and the risk you take unloading the bio waste. Management shows favoritism and doesn’t care that everyone knows. The job is not worth the headache.
bad,My work day was completely packed from the moment I clocked in until I clocked out. I was often expected to preform roles out of my job range without training  and to juggle many jobs at the same time. The work culture was not good the workers were under paid and not appreciated. The hardest part of the job was the lack of support from management.
bad,"When I started working here things were alright. But afterwards it is east to see and feel the tensions of working here, amongst the many other issues."
bad,If you have any sense of morals do not apply at Stericycle. The amount of law suits against this company proves that the unethical sales tactics are what this company is all about. As long as you make your goal they do not care how it's done. I was told honest selling will not get you anywhere and to turn your mind off when your having doubts about whether what you're doing is right or wrong. If you think you've got the hang of it they'll move you to a new team with the same pay and 5x the work. But you don't get to approve or decline any of the role moves they run you through
bad,"I advanced as a temp from broom pusher to inventory control manager but was never compensated or even given the opportunity to go permanent and receive benefits. Instead of my hard work and diligence being rewarded, I was falsely accused of stealing time, degraded and made to feel insufficient. They hate to give raises and when they do it is for pennies on the dollar. For the hazardous nature of the job the employees are severely under compensated."
bad,You get in trouble for things you dont do you have terrible managers as well the only good thinbg about the job us te job work and the bonuses
bad,"No respect for there employees, your just a body and if you do not like the way thinks are ran and you will not your fired. management lies to you and they cheat there employees out of every dime they can."
bad,I didn't enjoy my time at this company. I worked for Shred It which is owned by Stericycle. Seven months of complete turmoil and confusion was all I could stand especially when a new CEO took charge.  This caused more chaos and poor moral within the terminal with new transitions and meetings that were not productive. We had to solve issues that should have been solved long before my hire date.
bad,Done with everything. One hospital that can never be satisfied no matter how good of a job u do nothing can make them happy I'm done I can't do this anymore
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,High turnover in upper management. Except for my boss. Long hours out of town a lot of times you will be at a whole week at a time.   Way too much work not enough help. Upper management does not have a clean on what you do.  They do not care on learning your job and what you do.
bad,Training and pay were fine. The Warehouse manager played to many games! He had his favorite 2 people and gave them all the easy work and kept them close! The other 5 of us did the hard jobs and had to do unlimited travel and overnight stays!! It Wasn't rare to leave Sunday night to be out of town until friday night!
bad,"If you like working long hours and being underpaid."
bad,Wouldnt recommend anyone working here. ......................................... Managers only care about there self and how much bonus they are getting.
bad,the one good thing about the company is the benefits. the office in brampton sucks. the overtime is always available. everyone from the management right down is disjointed. would not even tell my enemy to work for this company. playing favorites is how they work in that office
bad,"My overall review of stericycle is not a good one. The job itself is easy, however, management was a different story. There was a lot of favoritism within the company. Promotions and any growth in the company was given not based upon performance, but more so whether or not management liked you. The best part of the job was working from home. The best part of the job was learning medical terminology and the experience in the medical field."
bad,The division I worked for was just starting a large account and there were the typical growing pains that comes with it.
bad,This place is very unprofessional for a corporate office. Management does not support their employees and work together to fire staff. They offer to pay little and don’t want to allow overtime but expect to give large work loads and throw more at you every chance they get. No one communicates and you’re not give all of the tools and guidance you need to do/excel at your job. They throw you to the wolves and expect you to be perfect. Would not recommend this place.
bad,"Worst place to work with ... "
bad,I do not wish to rate this company at this time. It is a good training company for people who first get a CDL license to learn different equipment. Not high on pay.
bad,The management is awful in the dunmore location. When reported to HR Management did everything they could to remove you from working there. Awful place to work all upper management is flying beat the seat of thier pants and have no plans for the Long haul. People steal thungs from desks and nothing is done about it. When trying to advance in the company the expect you to do to do the extra work with no extra pay.
bad,working with medical professionals trying to avoid patient issues for the most part. Doctors complaining about the patients and vice versus on site staff doesn't know their behinds from their elbows most technical advice comes from remote login quality help never stays they realize what it is. Most qualified people do not get promoted.
bad,Management or not for the employees instead of helping they out to see you fail and it very uncomfortable to work at times hopefully it gets better if not the turnover will continue to be very high
bad,"Management is terrible, people seem to get promoted based on if they are liked by the hiring manager, regardless of whether they would be best at the job. No staff moral, high staff turnover due to people being treated so poorly by the managers and team leaders. Stay clear. Customers suffering and unhappy due to the staff not wanting to be there. I saw many staff being reduced to tears during my time there."
bad,"fabulous it was a very family oriented company to work for., the manager was always willing to work with the employee with any issues. training was always top notch"
bad,This job is not what it seems like at all! The pay was 9.75 then they bumped it up to 10.15 which is not enough definitely dealing with those type of calls.
bad,"If a problem arises, management ignores it until the reps stop brining it up.  Horrible direction.  Treat customers and employees like garbage."
bad,"Not a nice to work, with team leaders being the ones to fire you for looking at them when they were having a bad day."
bad,They will do everything they can to make you feel like your replaceable at the drop of a hat. They do not always follow the policies and procedures that are in place.
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,The management that I dealt with made up lies to get me fired. Also human  resources did not investigate any of  the changes against me. There is no more to say about this.
bad,"Productive work place, clean, very nice coworkers, some supervisors are great and some are unorganized but overall and it's an nice  environment to work in"
bad,"they hire you for one position and then change things on you, they assign telemarketing services to you but call it customer service. Training is not adequate. The company will throw you under the bus in order to make money. It's sad when a business will not stand up for their employees. New raises are based on performance but some low performers who happen to be cool with their managers get better raises than those who work harder and are of more value to the team. I would not advise anyone come here. Turnover rate is very high."
bad,Sounds easy enough but its very hard on your body to walk 7 miles between 5am-1pm. Training sucked. Don't ever offer to pick up a shift at another location to help out. You will not get trained and then get in trouble for doing something wrong. I worked every other day but was so tired spent the rest of my day and my off day in bed on a heating pad. I really think the shifts should have been shorter. But I think the problem was that the compensation sucked and they couldn't get anyone to work for them. Personally I feel longevity of employees is key to a successful company.
bad,The business is going through rapid internal transition for a variety of factors. If you are willing to experience uncertainty and lack of communication in hopes that where there is change there is opportunity this is the place for you.
bad,"I don’t want to sound negative. However, I’m going to be honest. The company is very unprofessional, poor management. Training is horrible. Company lack how to run a company and the pay is terrible. Extremely high turnover. Just no professionalism at all."
bad,Temp job through kelly sevices. One day we get a called that their laying off the whole 3rd shift but we had to come in for the last day. No warning until the day off. People quit other jobs to work there. They hired a shift for 2 weeks then let them go. We couldnt go to other shifts.
bad,As a former driver when I first started it was one of the best jobs I could ever work for management and workers and drivers had a great relationship. Does able to come into your well as you chose it to come back at a reasonable time punch out move on to the next day. It wasn't until they Incorporated this program adopted by UPS called Road what drivers have to follow the road net program route when everything went downhill so every mistakes that's being made now I'll pointed at the driver's.
bad,It was a nice company but nothing i could see myself as being there for awhile and growing. The call center is very strict and treats aldults as if they were children
bad,If your willing to commit  long hours and holidays its the perfect job however management is a joke they are very strict and baisef and only cover theyself and what the need at the employees risk with no regards for respect or how to communicate properly
bad,"I worked here for 2 days and i had a bout enough!! If you like working with lazy people who care less, well this is the place to be!! They don't answer calls nicely, they all have this miserable attitude and that is how they handle each call!! you would think that if you have an emergency and expect to speak to your doctor after hours that these 3rd party idiots would take their job seriously with a bit of empathy. But sad to say, that they don't!! they are there just to get paid and get out!! This company needs a deep cleaner, if you know what i mean!! starting with the people who manage!!! very UNPROFESSIONAL!! would not recomend to any one!! they should be shut down!!"
bad,"•	Process Manifests Daily"
bad,"Don't do it! Management sucks here. The company promoted the most inexperienced group they could find. The Trans Mgr can't drive a truck to save his life, much less run a route, nor will he try. The Trans manager, and both supervisors don't have a CDL at all, and neither do half the drivers. (Supposed to have at least an air brake endorsement.) No training worth a dime, and no leadership. Drivers have to help each other. Mgmt hands you the paperwork, and you're off. Don't even think about complaining here. Blacklisting and favoritism are huge here. Don't let the long list of benefits fool you. Once you're in, you're treated like a number. Reviews are once a year, and they aren't very generous. New guys say they wish they hadn't left their previous job to come here. Texas may have good cookouts, but not here. Once, maybe twice a year. Nothing extra to you for hard work. Customers complain about the company raising their rates, all the time. Money is for mgmt. That's all."
bad,"I wouldn't trust my worst enemy to work at a place like this. The job itself is pretty easy but the Jacksonville call center is the red-headed stepchild. You'll hear (and see) stories about all of the other centers getting upgrades and whatnot, but what will you see here? Roaches in the cabinets (no joke!), bugs, dirty carpets and computers (which don't work half of the time..), etc."
bad,"Applied for company in Hayward CA, they were very prompt in regards to contacting me for an interview (less than 24 hrs.) although there's approx. a 2 week process in the company choosing candidates for hire."
bad,"I worked at Stericycle for about a year and a half months, and in those months I experienced some of the worst business and employee management I had ever seen. Straight-faced lies about my schedule and proposed hours worked to criminal-like tactics of removing individuals who began to ask questions. While the people I worked with together were wonderful and the culture of the company at that level was respectable, there wasn't much else of delight at this company. Consistent and constant short-handed staff leading to 72 hour work weeks MANDATORY. Stay away from this dump-hole at all costs."
bad,need to get better front office  there stunk they cooked body parts for the health workers  was a bad place to work had to work on steam ovens and trash would be still in there
bad,stericycle is and job that lost of people have worked fr and have streghted and long was very easy job I learned how medicine could go bad over time and its not good to use out dated medicines
bad,Turn over rate very high company do not value employees an do not pay overtime. Company is not a good company to work for or grow with and is no advancement to grow with company
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,"Very loudand ghetto ,you can go to work today and be laid off tomorrow."
bad,I worked for the company through a temp agency. There wasn't any advancement opportunity. they did a mass hire that I was included on and let all of us go rather quickly. seemed as if there wasn't any work for us to do so they let us go.
bad,"If you work well alone this is a good place to work a lot of OT. Don't expect to be appreciated for your work, and it can be very Hostile. Having an abundance of patience is a must. Not for long term."
bad,"I worked for this company for about 9 months  and the work environment is horrible the management doesn't care. the company use to be extremely good with great benefits,  but they hire people who don't care about the company or there work"
bad,Once agin I love working with people and helping my clients. The job does work with you to be your best.
bad,A typical day at work was talking to angry people who were frustrated about their insurance plans and benefits
bad,"I had been working there for a few months with only one excused absence on my record when I found out I was pregnant. A couple of weeks after learning of my pregnancy I suffered a miscarriage. While laying in a hospital bed I received a call from my supervisor informing me that I had been let go due to attendance. I attempted to explain my absence (even though I was sure to call every evening and send an email to my supervisor daily). I explained that I had paperwork from the doctors proving my valid absence. Still, she claimed there was nothing to be done. These people are vicious and cruel and only look out for their personal gain. Family oriented? I think not."
bad,"Company does not provide fair raises, and management does not see the well-being of employees as a priority. Company provides great training, but there is a lack of respect where it concerns team lead and supervisor interactions with team members."
bad,"It’s a company in which they prefer going around the law instead of doing what they are supposed to, I saw so many scary things during my visits that I really hope they have changed."
bad,"The job itself is great. The management and HR team are horrible. They don’t care about employees. Period. We are worthless life forms.  No support givin. My manager and his little “boy” were the worst team I’ve ever encountered. They lie, cheat and steal. Then mid and upper management support the actions of these rogue don lies. Insecure, narcissistic big shots. Like playground bullies. Avoid at all costs. They will screw you givin the chance!"
bad,"Contract workers rarely gets converting on to company benefits, but if you get hired on by the company you are more likely get company perks. Company always has a hiring freeze but able to hire contract workers. A lot of favoritism goes on on premises."
bad,There’s is no training procedure for the job I held. There is plenty of negative feedback and very little positive. No matter how hard you try to stay on top of things it is unobtainable. The work day leaves you feeling underachieved and stressed out.
bad,This place is turning into a call center. No culutre ans no real training. Upper management doesn't care about the employees anymore. Late bonuses every quarter.
bad,"They love younger workers who lack knowledge and experience. The manager is a closet homosexual with persistent advances. ""Work smart not hard"" is the motto of many though the plant deals with unregulated medical waste. Place smells like oven cooked death and they do not pay enough nor protect workers enough. If you are a young bonehead, older jailbird, or otherwise dumb and messy individual this job is for you. If you like to be treated with respect and compensated well for carrying out an extremely dirty job look elsewhere."
bad,Management is terrible. Disorganized and they don’t comment well. They offer a lot of overtime i guess that’s a plus but the environmental is unhealthy similar to high school
bad,"I worked at the plant for 2 years. I became a lead for about half that. My schedule changed 10 times in 2 years. Pay is low especially for what you are exposed to and are required to get shots annually.  "
bad,Not a place to retire with. Use it as a stepping stone and move on. No advancement opportunities. Everyone underpaid for the hazardous risks. No loyalty.
bad,"At a glance, this place seems like a great place to work. Do not let that fool you. I have never been employed by a place when supervisors will actually call down an employee while on an production floor, tell an employee that they do not like the sound of their voice, call a young lady trashy and the list goes on. This company used to be known as Fineline. I think Stericycle should really take a long hard look at their donor centre as soon enough they'll find themselves in the thick of a human rights claim"
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,"The job is ok, Does not Challenge you, Supervisor can not be reached when needed. Hard to advance even though you put in the work."
bad,Pretty much laid back and you worked by yourself without the supervisor hovering over you. The hardest part was getting use to the smell. All the employees were easy to work with.
bad,Most employees do not work well together. Department Managers only care about themselves and not what the customer needs. They provide poor containers that  don't lock and are in bad shape. It is all about Wall Street.
bad,The pay is too low for the amount of thinking you're going to have to do here. Call Center reps start at $10.00/hr and don't go very far up from there.
bad,"I worked for the answering service section of Stericycle so my average was day was answering the phones for upwards for 200 different business. That may sound tricky but every company has their owns scripts and questions that were mandatory to ask and the system knew which scripts to generate based on what phone number the client called. I learned all about HIPPA and the importance of confidentiality and a new found respect for telemarketers, being on the phone for 8-10 hours a day is a lot harder than it sounds. The hardest thing about the working at Stericycle wasn't the heart wrenching calls or even being yelled at by clients because their calls haven't been returned yet, you learn not to take the insults and swearing personal. the hardest part was dealing with management.  You're at the beginning about the great open door policy which is not as open as you're lead to believe. There was a lot of shaming if you had to call out even if you had FMLA and needed to use that. The best part of working at Stericycle honestly was chatting with all the other agents. We were a work from company so you didn't actually have to face to face interactions with anyone but we still found way to get to know each other and even played games when the call volume was slow enough to allow it.. Would i work there again, no probably not."
bad,"Good for a temporary position, but not for a long term period   management lacks skills to lead and take charge. They lack all the skills to manage the company and mange people."
bad,Work culture is not healthy. The company doesnt sand on what they say. I am currently looking to leave the company due to lack of advancement and consistency.
bad,Didn't like the job at all but loved the weekly paychecks from the temp agency was offered a permanent position on my second day took them 4 months to get going on the paperwork by which time a different opportunity came along
bad,No room for advancement. Management is constantly changing. They rather hire from external sources than promote from within. Plant workers usually work from 10AM-630PM which is pretty much all day long so you can't handle any business without using s sick day. Plant/warehouse workers are usually segregated from the rest of the company as if we are not equal. Supervisor also embarrasses you when you speak in the morning and gets extremely agitated if you ask him a question. If I didn't have kids to feed I'd quit a day after starting.
bad,"Don’t go through temp services. They will end the assignment at anytime "
bad,"Picking up dirty medical waste, dropping off clean boxes. Learned the more you do the more they expect. Management needs help, culture supposedly is family orientated in fact it is A LOT of favoritism. Used to be a great place until a GPS took over routes, most of which take you down no truck routes, corporate found a way to hire non-cdl drivers for less money just terrible."
bad,"The leadership was very unorganized and unprofessional. They handled the Houston layoffs in the ""un-classiest"" way ever. Everyone worked around the clock."
bad,"Not enough call volume, not much training on site. your given time to look over the slide shows because there isn't enough calls coming in and out of the system for you to do much. You do more siting then working on the job."
bad,"●	Made outbound calls on pharmaceutical recalls"
bad,Co-Workers are Awesome. Things changed over night. Goals are unreachable with customer base not where it once was. Management doesn't understand that a lot of companies are now Paperless. Some companies will not return due to bad service they received.
bad,Job was ok. it has a lot of advancement since the last I worked there. I can not say a lot about the job as it has been so long since I have actually worked there.
bad,"Since a recent acquisition the company has a poor work life balance. Promotions were given to individuals who don't know the job and their subordinates are training them.The ratio of employees to staff to handle the workload is unreal.   Managers expect employees to work many additional hours to keep up with the work load. Little to no regard is given to the fact that some employees have families and other obligations. Proper training is rarely provided to give employees the tools needed to be successful in their job.   This is especially true in the human resources department.  The average work week is 6 days and no less than 10 hours a day.  Some of the supervisors and managers play favorite's; while holding those they don't like to a certain standard, others are allow to do what ever they want without question. The benefits at Stericycle are probably some of the better provided by an employer, but they are not worth the stress."
bad,"Very low pay place that mostly hires temp employees.  The workload is not that high, which is a plus.  It's kind of interesting work although very repetitive.  Floor management is overworked and you don't see much of them.  Upper management is dishonest and you can't believe anything they tell you. Insurance and benefits are about the worst you can find anywhere."
bad,"The list of issues I encountered during my tenure is expansive and tedious. To go through it would resemble a complaining teenager after the first few jaw-dropping unethical / immoral / and sometimes illegal practices that are warranted here. Instead, the list of things that are a positive influence during one's stay here is much quicker to go through. There aren't any."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,"Watch what you do, they love to cut corners and circumvent regulations and permits, the reason I left, my license is too important."
bad,"The company has a very serious self image.  From St. Louis west. It is a very clandestine,  and engulfed by bad actors in Management.  I saw phsical misconduct,  major D.O.T. violations and  an attitude of play along or be destroyed.  As employees rise in pay, management pushes them out the door. They pride themselves as being the Wal-Mart of waste, and raise the rates to the customers,  whenever they desire. Never the less, very disappointed base. Professional folks,  should stay away."
bad,"Stericycle is a billion dollar company.  I worked in the inside sales division in Northbrook.  Management and Leadership has no clue that the choices they have made have led the company to falter."
bad,"To many bosses, no real defined work parameters.  Project management not informative at all.  Projects concerning my locations were not given to me in a timely manner. Supervisors micro managed and reprimanded when so aspects were not completed due to other bosses/projects.  Was never fully trained on many aspects of job. Supervisor/Project management completely unresponsive when informed of actual issues not what was planned."
bad,"Stericycle is a great place to begin your career, but I would not recommend staying longer than a year. They don't develop you into roles that will allow you to be successful outside your position. If you want to be in sales by all means this is the place to be, but if your goal oriented this is not the place for you"
bad,Stericycle does not give its employees a chance to move up in the company. They make rules that do not make sense to anyone and I feel they made them to try to find reasons to let people go while trying not to let them receive unemployment.
bad,"Warning.... dead end job. "
bad,"It is a good company to work for if one would like having time to further their schooling. The hours are completely flexible. Other than that it's pretty much get the job done, have great customer service, and a smile can get you far."
bad,"Couldn't wait to get out of there."
bad,"Stericycle would be a half way decent place to work if not for the poor management, low pay, and the inability to grow and move up. Once you've been there a while they stop caring and expect more from you and when you give them what they want they expect more from that."
bad,"the longer you work here the worse you get treated.very poor communication between management to employees.raises are little to none till your capped out in your current position then its nothing no matter how long or hard you work.  employees are not treated with any respect or value.they don't care if you leave or stay.your always ""replaceable"" and they let you know it. no bonuses of any kind.Christmas ect while company profits were 89.9 million last year."
bad,"Upon hire I was informed that it was highly unlikely that I would ever be promoted. I had a hard time getting my supervisors to take care of issues that were above my pay grade and mostly received very vague answers to any questions I had. Rather unstructured environment, travel 18+ miles to locations, zero incentives, high turn over rate."
bad,"With Stericycle I was able to work with all parts of the business helping to identify inefficiencies and improve processes.  The culture was lacking and management needed improvement, but I enjoyed working with such a diverse team."
bad,"stressful, poor leadership and no professionalism. Company does not follow regulations and often turn the eye to illegal practice by employees. Employees as overworked"
bad,Supervisors only care about not having to drive. If they are short they will make you work even if you have a funeral. As long as they do not have to drive. Also they have no compassion for you and talk to you like you are nothing. We are suppose to have 4 tens no weekends and we get forced to work our off day even if you have something scheduled they make you use a vacation day.
bad,"Favoritism is visible,  the hardest workers get more stops on their routes,  & the lazy ones get stops taken off. Upper management is no help as well when you have a problem, he's just worried about the feather in his hat. Heavy routes and long hours. Pretty bad when you're there before the manager and you get back and the managers already gone for the day."
bad,"Upper management, lied, manipulated, and let go people who had been with NNC Group for 17 years. I watched as one by one the upper management positions were replaced by individuals who had no idea what the person they replaced did. It was a huge team spirit killer. People walking around crying, as they watched people they worked with and respected for decades let go like they meant nothing. No farewell, no goodbye, it was done late a night under the guise of a 'meeting'. People just vanished. Very sad."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,"Respectfully decline to comment on my experience at Stericycle.  I was transitioned into a position after Shred-it was acquired.  My previous position was eliminated due to the organization's restructuring.  Then, after being in my new position for 6 months that position was also eliminated."
bad,"Conflicting training from various people in management. There is no standard operating procedure for anything, certainly not in writing or otherwise. They change the rules and the scripts every other day. I was actually moved 6 times in the brief time that I was employed there. It reminded me of a boiler room environment, few of the cubicles have walls, the sound level is ridiculous. They record and grade your every call. They hold impromptu, meaningless meetings a couple times a day. You are measured on everything, time away from your desk, you name it.. Incredible amount of micro management. Politics and favoritism is alive and well in regard to quality of the leads given depending who your are.  I was happy to get out of there, possibly the worst experience, work wise in my life."
bad,"The company was okay, And they offer a generous"
bad,"It’s a decent company to work for, the pay could be better. Benefits are decent . It’s a great diversity of people, calm atmosphere . Some people are very helpful, others not so much."
bad,I have the experience of working in this shameful environment for almost a year and every day of my stay was a strange and remorseful experience for me. I had worked in multiple places before but this company is definitely the worst. THE ONLY REASON FOR ITS DOWNFALL IS THE MANAGMENT. they have no respect for their employees. treats you like a towel which they use and throw out.
bad,"If you get hired to do customer service, don't expect any promotions or pay increases unless the management likes you.  Some of the management think you're nothing but a machine that takes calls, and will write you up if you do one little thing incorrectly.  Additionally, attendance is based purely on a point system.  Doesn't matter if you get a cold or into a car accident, once you get enough 'points' you're out the door.  The company also refuses to upgrade any of the systems and computers we use on the floor, so I hope you enjoy working with computers from 2006."
bad,"This was an incredibly toxic work culture. When I was contacted about switching from 'contractor' status to 'permanent' status, the manager I reported to after having been hired told me he was forced to hire me and planned on firing me."
bad,"Pay is ok u till you realize they are rolling jobs into one"
bad,"The benefit package is great but there is no work life balance. Managers will do anything to push out their talented employees and find reasons to keep the horrible ones. The communication is horrible and no one is ever on the same page hence the reason why projects are almost always in total disarray. They pretend to have a workplace culture, but it purely doesn't match up to the company's mission statement."
bad,"This company is still caught up in supplying its growth.  As much as all companies value and encourage employees' with a 'go getter' attitude; this company falters when it comes to supporting and remunerating them.  One will need the ability to wear many hats in any role that they fill with this company, most especially this facility."
bad,Good Full time or part time job for students. Poor management no advancement stericycle does not consider the cost of living in California. Hope they change that .
bad,Easy work and very laid back environment. Managers micromanage and are very particular on time frames. Break room  is a plus because of all the snacks and nice seating.
bad,"I am a sharps technician for Stericycle. I feel like I have a lot of extra time as there isn't really much to do. I have never met or spoke with anyone from cooperate which is very disappointing, I can't even get my direct supervisor on the phone most days. The pay is fair considering the work you do. This is a perfect job for a teenager, although they'll represent it as a career opportunity."
bad,In areas of HR and safety there is very little support and financial corrections are at the bottom while execs are added. Stericycle is a growth by acquisition and does not foster organic growth.
bad,A typical day would include harassment and haranguing by supervisors and managers who cant sufficiently coach or groom their agents because they do not know the extent of the agents jobs so they supplement knowledge and motivation with reprimand policy quoting. The pay is actually decent if you were only doing your own job. Agents are asked on a daily basis to accommodate other departments and do their work.
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,"Stericycle call centers are a very stressful place to work.  The shifts are very long with  short breaks, NO WEEKENDS OFF, management changes every year and so does the rules, and you have to work most holidays . If you have sick time and  call off for a shift you're still written up but your days are used for the call off. You can pick up a shift to remove the write off but your attendance will still be effected.A typical shift includes very rude callers including some of the clients, who verbally abuse you and a system that's either down or lagging.  A lot of work but not that many rewards. Did I mention long hours?! I believe that it would be a better company to work for if the employees were taken into consideration a bit more .  On the days off we would like to spend time with family and friends not catch up on sleep. The benefits are good but overall Its not a company I would recommend this company to someone who doesn't have a social life or family."
bad,"I've worked at Stericycle for almost 5 years. The work can be hard at times but the people is why I stayed. Recently I applied for the supervisor position and am overly qualified.  However, I was turned down because of where I live.  So now I'm stuck having the same part time hours and breaking my back to never get ahead.  I was told when I was hired that more hours would be available and with my background,  advancements will become available.  So much needs to be changed with this company. Their workers are not important enough.  It's all about the money as usual."
bad,Very poor corporate culture.  The integrity of the corporate managers is lacking.  Corporate managers have no idea what the employees do each day.  Disappointing.
bad,"Check truck every morning going over paper work worst was working in the rain certain customers didn't keep up with their delivery date but I learned a lot and I thank, them, for everything"
bad,"Company has went from ""medical waste giant"" to stock value failure. False belief that roadnet and all it's non-sense is so wonderful and blah blah...  Truth is most troubles correlate with the grand roadnet roll-out."
bad,"Short breaks, employees are micromanaged and lied to by management. For example: I was hired by the Winthrop Center for $11.00 an hour starting pay however when I accepted the position and was placed on the Winthrop Team at Farmington I was told I was to be paid $10 an hour instead (despite still working for Winthrop!) because it was an incentive for Winthrop employees only. When I had replied that I had signed on for $11 and that was misleading to allow people to sign on than pay them less I was told by management that I could take less money or not take the position... only to have them turn around and start giving new hires a dollar an hour more later on, which was much higher than the $0.15 cent raise given to the current employees to make up for it. Pay is incredibly low compared to other call centers in the general area and benefits aren't that great. Management refuses to work with employees seeking higher education or changes in hours. Better than no job I guess, but if you can do something else I would highly recommend it. There are much better call centers to work at in the area."
bad,This job is good for students in college or people in high school. Not a place to work long term. Those who train should have a minimum of 1 year a the job and be at the highest level there is for call takers.
bad,"If you are not part of the click, nothing good will happen for you. A big company like this and no bonus at the holiday, how cheap can you get. High deductibles for insurance. Its a job for now"
bad,"Cross-selling is defiantly something to embrace, was a great way to sell new products to your prospects. Large line of services to offer. Competition can't touch the lines of service offered."
bad,Stericycle was a very nice place to work but sometimes it got a little overwhelming dealing with some of the coworkers and their attitudes. I it had to be the bigger person and ignore them for my job and staying professional
bad,"Good place to work but with everything going on, pay has decreased with the same job responsibility. I would not recommend working there until there has been a change of structure."
bad,"As a driver on the job for several years the max raise you can achieve per year is 3%, provided you maintain a flawless record through out the year. So if you are an exceptional employee you will receive a ""raise"" that hardly keeps up with inflation. I don't see this as much of a raise at all, just a price index adjustment. The company would say the money isn't available to pay more. Maybe if there wasn't so much redundancy in the multiple layers of middle management more money would be available. I'm old and stuck, but I don't see these pay practices attracting much new talent into our doors."
bad,"It is a go with the flow work environment. If you do not like rapid change, it might not be the right atmosphere for everyone. It does allow flexibility at times"
bad,Very relaxed and laid back work at your own pace but meeting production.Very team work based.Do not pay enough to have a family.Love the work and the enviorment
bad,"Duties where driven by the ""customer first"" motto, which gave me lots of gratitude to push myself to work everyday towards excellence in customer service along with a great team. "
bad,"The overall culture is highly reactive and lacks communication and practical execution to the individuals who are impacted by the change. This creates an environment that lacks employee engagement, but requires high demands and hours to execute on objectives with a day or days notice. This results in a poor quality product or launch of a new process or initiative, thereby continuing the poor culture cycle."
bad,"A typical worked day was answer all phone calls and make sure the customer was happy. I learned that good products can go bad no matter how much they cost. The management there was not good at all because every time you needed help, they were never there to help you. You had to walk all around the building just to find them. The co-workers there was great we all worked as a team when needed help. The hardest part of the job was not knowing the answer to the customer question because of the little training. Last the most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customers as well as talking to them."
bad,"Compensation is adequate and work/life balance is good but company is poorly run with a culture of blaming, finger pointing and a general lack of teamwork or cooperation. After 6 months you will want out."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,Stericycle was a very unpleasant place to work because nothing was organized. No one received adequate training which made the environment very tense and frustrating because everyone was pretty much teaching themselves. Management was hardly ever around when you needed them. My co-workers were the best. We always tried to make the best out of a bad situation.
bad,"Work was very easy for me cause I've been in the industry for about 6 years, I learned to never be complacent in anything I do, always keeping on the alert and being cautious of my surroundings. Management could've been more visual and serious when making decisions. Most co-workers looked out for themselves, one of the hardest part of my job was communicating with management, and the best part of my job was learning something different everyday."
bad,"Assisted with Medicare verification during open enrollment"
bad,Working here was an exhausting and draining experience. It being a call center you are expected to take as many calls as possible with your hours and the nature of the business left me drained and unmotivated.
bad,This company used to be a pleasant place to work but that changed with new CEO and her management team.  The turnover is ridiculously high and they don't get that maybe if they paid current employees more it would be less expensive than constantly training new people.
bad,"The job itself wasn’t bad; however, management is a joke.  One of the managers sister-in-law is also a manager who works almost directly under him (conflict of interest). My direct supervisor (a 60-year old in a 30-year long adulterous relationship with a married man she talks about all day) would never allow me to do any work without having gone through her first.  She was paranoid about how the drivers felt about her - so much so she used to (illegally) record the drivers while she was training them or having any conversations with them. she has also (illegally) recorded meetings between herself and her bosses.  It was a very hostile work environment considering you never knew what mood she would be in.  Also, I don’t miss the second hand smoke from her smoking INSIDE of the building (against the law since like the 80s?). My concerns and complaints fell on deaf ears, as to be expected."
bad,"Management is no good. "
bad,"Came in through a staffing agency. Although the,work is very easy, the pay is very low, and there's not much room for growth, especially coming in through a,staffing agency. They barely hire in, you have temps who have been working there as a temp over three years and still not hired in yet."
bad,"Majority of people that work there are criminals and not very good at working as a team. Corporate does not car about anyone unless you're the VP or directors, in other words if you are not high on the ladder don't expect any recognition from anyone other then the people you see daily and if you have a good manager/supervisor"
bad,It would be a wonderful job if it was more business appropriate and business first. So many managers and team leads and not enough WORKERS .poor training everything crammed in a short period of time.
bad,"Change out sharps container, in patent rooms and  procedure area. I would make sure that the Carts are properly. Then I would collect all the Pharmaceutical waste and stage it in its proper place as well."
bad,This job is very limited in where you can go in this company. Management is a little unorganized. We are underpaid for what type of waste we collect on a daily basis. I feel that there is a lack of communication from the top brass to the working folks. The company  cares more about cutting down hours than how effected you are with the customers.  We charge a very high price for our services and they dont allow you to spend anytime with the customers who have to foot these big bills. Over all the company could be better if the communication between managers and staff would improve and they stopped worrying about hours and more on customer satisfaction by allowing us more time to give great service.
bad,"Work at Stericycle is challenging because you have Doctors, Nurses, Office employees, H.R., A.P.  & A.R., and IT people calling and asking for assistance with their accounts usually after something happens and you have to fix it for them as they are panicking. "
bad,The branch at kent is super sketch and does not welcome newcomers. They are a tight-knit group who gossip between each other and WILL NOT think of you as part of the team. Poor direction job wise and give hints at how the work is done. They do not have a rubric to even learn their own system. It is an honest joke.
bad,This is a company that acquisitions of other successdul company's that they decide they want. Then they come in and ruin everything that was good. Totally ruined a great place to work
bad,Pay is above the standard. Management is non-supportive and does not seem to care about work life balance as well as moral. Employees steal and management looks the other way.
bad,"Growth by acquisition organization.  Experience gained was comparable to none.  Stericycle HR Team is amazing and truly lives by the One Team One Goal mentality.  The team has always done whatever it takes to ""get the job done"" with a smile on their face."
bad,"I like the actual tangible job that I do, I like being a leader and encouraging growth, but I am now looking for a new job as I feel my current employer does not encourage advancement, and job proficiency can hold you back as opposed to help you advance. Those who are not being utilized in their current position because they are under-performing are advanced in hopes that this advancement will encourage productivity, which it may, but it discourages those who become stuck in positions that they are needed."
bad,"They have a really bad point system that is not realistic for emergencies , especially if you have children or any everyday life problems."
bad,"24/7 on call duties."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,"Management was horrible no one was treated the same a lot of people received positions they did not deserve. Supervisors threatening staff, not having a heart in certain circumstances."
bad,"Very stressful environment and they wanted you to service average of 25 stops per day even though they gave minimal training; more like a few ""orientation"" rides. Manager was always waiting for you at the end of the day to nit-pick every little thing that he deemed you did incorrectly on your shift and rarely were you praised for a job well done. So, even though you thought you had actually improved or had done something correctly, he was always there to find something wrong with your performance. In the end, I feel that had there been a little bit more of tolerance, I think that I would have been a star performer."
bad,"I loved the job from the beginning and was able to not only use my current skills but gain new skills. Over the years I had the chance to learn different departments and be under different supervisors.  But in the last year or 2 things have changed. The company downsized overall and way to much in our building.  This forced me into a job I did not want. After some time I was asking for help with a situation and felt I was no longer part of a team.  I had no support to ""back"" me up and those above me that should have been my support was not only looking for any possible error to use against me but was supporting the co-workers under other supervisors working against me instead. Wish things were different but I can only change myself and do my best and hope that is enough for the company and people I work for and with."
bad,"I have a terrific manager and coworkers that I really enjoy... but the majority of them are simply NOT qualified to do their jobs. It's like herding kittens on a daily basis. I am CONSTANTLY having to fix my colleagues's work because they honestly have no idea what they are doing."
bad,"The management allowed for me to work without being micromanaged in my department specifically. The company overall lacked in communication between departments and did not seem to be pulling in the same direction. The culture overall is poor, and it reflects in attitudes by many employees. My direct management works to foster a professional environment, but there are challenges from other aspects of the company."
bad,"I was a class 2 driver , I liked the early starts as did mean you could go home early if your lucky, Like I saw in a previous comment, The smell at some of these places is horrific, even more when dead animals have been sitting in a locked, unvented container for a week,  That was me out,"
bad,"To be honest, its not the worst job I've ever had, yeah its dirty and dusty at times with a lot of heavy lifting but generally (at my old depot) were pretty well planned to be back on your hours ."
bad,Kept changing my start time because of trucks not showing up when supposed to.same job every day cleaning up after lazy people. Not enough pay for the job. Promised route driving job stuck in Warehouse.
bad,"Advertised as a class 2 driving job, the maximum driving time you will get in 11 hours is 4 hours if your lucky and is considered a very easy day."
bad,Lacks management and does not care about employees. Benefits should be provided but are instead paid by employee and to high. Has changed schedule and hours weekly without any notice or concern of your appointments. Drivers left to fend for self in field if its after hours. Management comes and goes as they please leaving no one in office to assist if needed.
bad,"I recently worked as a driver for the Port Coquitlam, B.C. branch.  While my local branch manager was great, head office lets the entire organisation down."
bad,"Working in ComSol for Stericycle has many challenges daily; often times, due to the size and nature of the company, we create a lot of our challenges ourselves.  Accountability is considered one of our Core Values in the company, but in the ComSol division, Accountability is often neglected, and it can be very difficult to get real goals accomplished within the division.  There are great Managers in ComSol in all branches of the division, and then there are Managers that are lackluster and don't want to put in the effort to understand ComSol to help make real change, they just go through the motions and get by with it.  The most enjoyable part of the job, is the ability to work remotely.  That should be a perk, not the most rewarding benefit.  At mid and top tier leveled Account Management positions, Sr. Leadership pushes organic growth and identifying opportunities to make that happen, which is great, and the mid and top tiered Account Managers have a great impact on organic growth, but they aren't compensated fairly for their impact and only receive a base salary."
bad,"I been working there for 12 start in production till I became maintenance then after years they start cut people all company, but when u make good money ,a little mistakes they cut u off they use this as excuse"
bad,At first it was a great place to work at but after a few years the company started getting money hungry and costumers started hating stericycle and they started pushing and pressuring there workers.
bad,"You should work here is you can put up with the stress, but don’t think it’s going to go away, it will be stressful from the day you start until you leave."
bad,Work on paperwork and unbilled revenue. I entered in all invoices that came in to the facility and did all the paperwork that came in from all over the country.
bad,"My experience with stericycle was awesome. My duties we're respond to incoming calls, obtain information, verify information, schedule appointments for clients, adding new clients into the database, placing inquiries on each completed account,  processing  B.R.'s. Escalate calls to higher department, update clients personal information."
bad,They sent you to a training session and they did teach you all the things they threw a lot of information at you in a couple weeks on the job you basically learn by trial and error and if you made a mistake you pay dearly for it everything was last minute you waited waited waited and then you had to do it and do it flawlessly or fix it no matter what it took. I developed a Sleep deficiency issue while I was employed at Stericycle
bad,"A typical week for a sales executive is 12-16 appointments, 240 cold phone calls, 25 door to door cold calls, and 25 seeders mailed out. Must to be a true hunter to succeed in this role. Very little leads are given to you. Lots of competitors in this market selling for much less."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,Stericycle needs better management.  The benefits and compensation is nice.  I feel that the company is double sided with its employees and no one is treated equal.
bad,long days and nights. not much was learned no one wanted to help. management was very poor and rude. co- workers were great that is how  got by. jumping into the job with no direction. best part is when is was time to leave.
bad,"The pay is not market rate. No transparency in the company, which makes it hard to vision advancement and growth."
bad,"stericycle is turning to  a remote (work from home) call center, not interested in this position. Very stressful job, dealing with rude callers very demeaning."
bad,"I am certainly grateful to have a descent job, but being cursed out or the dealerships in automotive being rude and nasty towards you is not necessary especially when you are just trying to help and support their request."
bad,"Stericycle was a company that gave me a chance when nobody else would. I've learned a lot over the last decade there. "
bad,"Working for Stericycle has it's moments. There is not much opportunity for advancement and management is not the best. Good Benefits and decent pay. There is a lack of accountability for the company when it comes to holding management accountable. Good working hours, M-F."
bad,"I’ve worked here a little over a year and I have to say, it has gone downhill fast. Our leadership has done little to back up employees who are worried about their contract being stolen from them, and overtime has become a crime, even when necessary. Some employees on location take the liberty to define what their jobs are despite what is listed in their application, and insult their coworkers verbally, but are untouchable because of their connections with higher up managers. I feel that I am no longer valued as an employee of this corporation, and am worth less than trash."
bad,The biggest struggle is help or more workers and management which really sucks across the board but would be a great company if they worked hard to put the right folks behind the desk.
bad,"I worked at a smaller specialty waste company that was bought out by Stericycle. Initially there was lots of opportunity for advancement in the handover, and the benefits were excellent, but management was poor and impossible to get ahold of within a year and the transition from small specialty waste company to a larger company did not go well."
bad,"I enjoyed the employees I worked with, they became friends of mine, if not only acquaintances, but I would say ""Hi"" to any of them I bumped into.  I learned very much about The Department of Transportation and added experience to my office management skills."
bad,Very dirty putrid smelling trailers.  Surrounded by death as pick ups in hospitals are usually next to morges. Non competitive starting pay for lq route cdl A drivers.  If you can stomach it for a while at least you'll get driving experience. Be prepared to smell feces and urine regularly.
bad,Management at the warehouse was very cut throat and unethical the time that I was employed there.  Room for advancement was slim and very political for this company.
bad,Una empresa muy responsable y Excelente manejo de cartera de Clientes
bad,"i left due to lack of communication on all managers and the presidents end. opportunities offered but the company never fallowed up. my experience was messed up from my 1st email, it had words spelled wrong, to my offer letter being addressed in someone else. through the end where i was promised an email from the president by 1pm on a Tues and come Wednesday at 9am it was not there. for this and so many more reasons i left the company."
bad,"I learned that incoming calls were more difficult than outgoing calls.  I enjoyed the experience and I wish it could have been longer, but it was only a temporary position."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
bad,"Company did not have a positive future outlook; Team in the office was great but not much support from higher up. Could colaborate to get what you needed but if it could not be answered by someone else at the same level as you, then answers were vague and often would be wrong."
bad,"We traveled 90% of the time to hospitals all over the country.  I was an installation team leader in charge of successfully completing the removal and installation of SHARPS containers.  We had to complete the job no matter the size of the hospital in 72 hours or less. I had anywhere from 4 to 15 employees under my control.  We had to work extremely fast and often worked long days.  My direct manager was good and took care of my team, but outside of that I was not too impressed with how the installation team was treated by other management personnel."
bad,hard work but good schedule and good overtime. alot of holidays and personal days
good,The organization needs to take a step back and review the process.
good,"Answering service for after hour clients. We have answered for hospitals, Doctors,Patients, and even Crisis Centers. Some messages were urgent and some none urgent which we had protocols to follow for each."
good,"When I started, it was okay. Starting pay was low. No raises. No growth potential. For the type of work I did, should have been better compensated. The tech is the face of the company. If we aren't happy, the company suffers. It's that simple. Now they are being booted out of hospitals  "
good,My most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers. We are like one big family. It feel certain members of management are not understanding and do not care what is going on in your life if it does not pertain to the company.
good,"was ok place to work , warehouse Manager  was great ,  but the district supervisors was a joke they was never wrong , their word was God , and you did not say nothing negative to them doesn't matter if it was the truth."
good,They didn't listen to their employees. The management team was terrible. Advancement in the company was like finding a needle in a hay stack. I would not work there again.
good,daily pick up of medical waste from hospital clinics nursing homes funeral homes  med waste may not be package properly but still must pickup you may be exposed to sharps needles human waste
good,"Everyone at this company is doing 3 jobs, compensation keeps dropping while profits rise. Working 14 hrs per day and NEVER catch up."
good,"A typical day at work is busy but laid back at the same time. Management was good while co-workers where nosy and too intrigued by other lives instead of them selves and working hard."
good,"There was a lot of down time due to, too many employees so we were often sent home early"
good,I worked for this company for 13 years because I was able to take care of the people that I hired and I was well compensated because of my work record.  the HR department needs a lot of work and the local management team in place is very weak.
good,"I have learned information concerning the automobile industry."
good,"I enjoyed working at Heartland Sweetners, but there was no room for advancements. I worked through Kelly Service which is a temporary agency. I was to when hired that it was not a permanent position. There were no benefits an the hours with change depending on distribution rates."
good,warehouse employment through temp service this wasn't the best experience for me
good,"boring everyday"
good,"A typical day at work consist of loading and unloading 52' trailers inbound and outbound , Scanning Manifesto for merchandise reporting lost items shrink wraping pallets of boxes, sorting Indy from providence, Daily forklift inspections, warehouse maintenance help drivers unload trucks accordingly of time arrived to the docks.  Basic Hazmat and Safety"
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of visiting Patient Rooms and Surgery areas to exchange full Sharps Bins & replace with empty bins. I found this position challenging due to equipment for the job such as Bio Carts being in severe need of repair. Management and the Equipment Facility dismiss it even if you indicate on your reports the carts need repair. Sometimes the Bins were not properly assembled or broken. I learned that with this company no matter how hard you work, they do not appreciate it. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with people even though Medical Staff members could be difficult to deal with at times."
good,"Daily grind work as it was retention services for Chrysler mopar automotive. "
good,"It can be pretty stressful on second shift due to offices being closed, you will speak to a lot of upset people majority of the time. It gets hard on you mentally overtime. Its frustrating to be doing the jobs of a few people at once."
good,"I loved my current assignment and team.  Having an excellent skillset and experience, I dove into my responsibilities and handled the workload without onboarding. Legal systems supporting the team/organization were poorly integrated and set up by members with no understanding of the legal industry/processes.  The assignment was complicated by a unique working environment; a planned layoff that collided with transformational efforts which left most employees unhappy and looking to see who was next. Full attention was given to the assignment but I found myself consistently cleaning up and redoing the work of colleagues who did not understand the implications of their involvement or lack thereof. Navigating the organizational structure was challenging. The company has a great executive board and is headed in great directions. They will eventually be where they need to be, I simply couldn't invest more time waiting for the dust to settle whilst looking/needing a full-time position with benefits."
good,"Stericycle has everything you would want from a big corporate company. They offer good pay, benefits, 401 K, and vacation.  They are large enough to offer advancement within the company."
good,"Stericycle is a very dynamic company that grows aggressively through frequent business acquisitions. Unfortunately, they have grown too fast and have struggled over the past few years with integration and business structure. Corporate realignment and restructuring every few years makes job security a bit shaky. Great people to work with at the facility level. You won't be bored..."
good,"Absolutely 0 training, programs promised to customers unattainable, 0 involvement from management and no room for advancement even if you are there for 5+ years."
good,Culture is so so depending upon where you work in the company.  Salary is terrible.  Management is poor.  The Directors are ruthless.  Unethical selling.
good,Don't care about employees. I worked hard and it went unnoticed. I wouldn't recommend a hard worker to work here. They only see black and white no color in between.
good,"We took calls for over 18 clients and were paid $10/HR. We complained to Human Resources regarding the pay and nothing was done. Also, the management were very unprofessional and would gossip about employees on the floor. In addition to that I would not tell management anything personal about yourself because the whole call center would know your business. The only thing I enjoyed about my job was the employees. We all became really close."
good,Training is very short and it isn't real training. The leads are great. The pay isn't great and hours aren't steady. Love the work environment though
good,"Not willing to compensate for the hazards that are faced on a daily basis. Midwest management needs to be looked at very closely and consider the people that are the front line of the company, service techs in the facilities. Ask questions and get detailed information of your job expectations before you hire in to this company. Various vaccinations needed and updated yearly for low pay and less information from upper management."
good,Depending on the supervisor the method of scoring your calls where not fair. Some of the staff were fair. Being bilingual was not advantageous. Some people got better treatment than others.
good,"Wonderful Site Director. Skilled Operations Managers. Supervisors are skilled but overly tasked! During my time at Stericycle, I had many positive experiences but also was very over burdened with tasks and additional ""growth opportunities"" that took away from time I needed to help my continual 20 plus new hire team members.Many days I had totake my work home."
good,Looking for a company to grow with. With good benefits. And would like a company to respect and be loyal to me as much as they what for me to be that way with them. And this is a rarity with companies. They want it to be one sided with it being in their favor. Why can't it be of equal grounds?
good,It really depended on what building you worked at. I worked at 2 different buildings. The main building offer a lot of drama. The 2nd building was less people but horrible management.
good,"The new leadership is driving a lot of change, and it is a very chaotic environment. Lots of good people have left and lots of dysfunctional people remain."
good,"Was an ok place for a pay cheque. didn't feel too much pressure was fun during the holidays, sometimes they would bring things like bagels and donuts. The  location not great and pay needs to be better but overall I've worked way way worse places."
good,"You never knew from one day to the next if your crew was going to show up, due to very high turn over rate, 90 percent of time ran crew short handed. Never saw management out on floor, or communicating with plant workers."
good,okay place some of the people were okay had great time with 3 of the people who I worked with.One not so much I would not recommend this place if you are not bi lingual they say they speak English but they do not
good,"Pros: Fantastic starter job. You will learn more about business and management than any other job straight out of college. Non linear hierarchy and a DIY training program."
good,"I was responsible for receiving inbound calls in a fast-paced setting and relaying critical details to on-call providers"
good,"The benefits are awesome, but what you have to do to get them is awful. I worked there for a few years and was never a happy camper. The management is horrifying, no room for growth, and unfair treatment."
good,I learned to do many things while employed at stericycle but you have to be the sole motivation for your learning. there is little to no support from management to help create a career path that will have you moving up no matter how great you are at your job. all in all it is steady work with lots of job security and if you don't mind doing the same thing each and every day with little to no opportunities for advancement then this is the place to be.
good,"Stericycleget on one  needs to learn how to make all company's work on one system. Also needs to look at  10 day sites we need and dont need, so they dont waste anymore money"
good,"I am a current employee at stericycle and i can say stericycle is a great job if you want to earn some quick cash especially if you take on some hours in the evenings or work weekends but as far as making it a career i don't think. The things i like about stericycle is the flexibility. That's pretty much it. The things i dislike about the company is the main manager is never in the office, you have team leads that don't do nothing but gossip about people. The accounts can be difficult and no the pay sucks."
good,I started the company as they installed sharpes containers in the hospital. I serviced them daily. Since it was a new establishment communication was a little sketchy about what was to be expected.
good,processing pharmaeuticals in a timely but orderly fashion furthermore putting them In different boxes and totes
good,"  I was terminated from this company from a Safety Manager position. I was under paid $20k-$30k what a safety manager should make. Facility managers will throw you under the bus in a new york minute. I was terminated because I did not build relationships to their specifications with my locations according to them. I think it was a cover for me not returning a bonus I was overpaid, I didn't know, wasn't my fault. I honestly couldn't afford to repay it. No a single supervisor I worked with at each of my locations had a bad thing to say about me. When I was allegedly not building relationships I was never told of a specific incident which could even remotely caused a drastic decision such as a termination. "
good,"A typical day consists of working very hard for really bad wages!!! You unload waste off 53' trucks then scan it and put it in large bin to cook. Some run a washer an dryer, cleaning containers of various sizes. then load them to go out the next day, this is all done in extreme heat and cold, with no compensation! Management will lie to you face from top to bottom! An corporate doesn't care as long as waste runs. Don't expect any bonuses unless your a lazy big wig. general plant worker is easy to get along with. The most enjoyable part of the job is the time off. The hardest part is jumping through hoops to make things happen and then looking at a paycheck! there is no chance of advancement!"
good,Inspection of plant and employee attendance verify all machinery is operational ensure that all supplies are ready for drivers and trucks are loaded.Ensure that all parts for equipment are available meeting with all supervisors.
good,Corporate driven. They want to cram 60 hours of work in a 4 day 40hour week. Constantly changing rules from corporate people not doing the work. Lots of turnover lately. Minimum advancement.
good,"It was a good place to work without having to think about job security.  Through a recent acquisition the company failed to prioritize and poorly managed the merger of a government regulated industry with a non-regulated one (obviously a more profitable one).  Overall, companies make certain financial decisions in order to further grow and expand, taking the easy way, affecting hundreds if not thousands, in some cases, of employees not to mention customer satisfaction.  Unfortunately this is one of those examples"
good,After nine years of working here I have realized many faults in the company. They prioritize revenue well beyond the needs and compassion for the people helping to make the company great. To bad if you have a small issue at home or you get a flat tire. This is not the case for all managers but is a common trend. There are plenty of great people that strive to make the company great as well as plenty of management that are very derogatory and biased.
good,"Nous étions syndiqués sans aucune bonne représentation de notre syndique. Les coûts pour cette représentation n'étaient pas justifiés, beaucoup trop coûteux. "
good,"I enjoyed working here at first, good pay and pretty much unlimited overtime. Being able to bring a decent amount of money was a good feeling. But then after working there for some time you realize that they are very one sided about certain rules, they only enforce them to a select group of people and not everyone else."
good,"work place was  very nice but managment sucks.a typical day was at least 10 hours.thehardest part of the job was getting to work to find out that you,the driver still had to load your own truck even tho it wasnt the drivers responsability."
good,"Well, I must say that this job came at a time that I needed to leave another horrible employer. But as for the job, the training was garbage. So was the pay, for the tremendous amount of information you're expected to remember and apply to your work. As a call center rep, I was NOT paid what I was worth, and the so-called full time hours were inconsistent. Barely made 36 hours a week, and off days were/are split. The team leads (with the exception of a few) were also a joke. Also, they could stand to be more lenient with the attendance policy...and CREATE MORE DEDICATED TEAMS for the different level clients instead of expecting the reps to tackle EVERY client call for the little pennies paid to them. If you decide to work here, try to NEGOTIATE your pay instead if just accepting the lowball rate like I did... and just stick around a little while for the experience. Then find something better."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,"I was written up for attendance violations that others seemed to get away with frequently. sexist atmosphere,  I'm only writing this because I have to find a new job thanks to them"
good,The company holds very little regard to the working employee. The average route driver or dock worker barely or sometimes does not even get their 40 hours. And upper management is always trying to figure out even more ways to cut time and money. immediate management are a lot more in tune with employee needs.
good,Laid off due to company restructure. The manager they had at my location didn't know what he was doing and I was often put in situations which put me in having to do something against company procedures.
good,"Workplace consisted of foul odor, heavy lifting, intense weather conditions, under paid workers,  Most time spent working Stericycle in Vernon, Ca is the biggest and busiest plant in the Stericycle company."
good,"Stericycle bought out our company a few years ago, but tried to make too many changes too quickly. Additionally there was a serious lack of proper management to implement those changes"
good,"Overall it was ok, the one problem was they would hire managers that did not know how to manage. I oversaw the site and was there early in the morning. to make sure the drivers were dispatched. I handle all the day to day operations and customer requests."
good,"Recent business transformation makes it hard to want to work here. The culture used to be great, but it has changed significantly recently. Hopefully, the future plan will create positive changes again."
good,Everyone gets paid different amounts to do the exact same job. It's a cool place to work. It's easy money. It allows you to get on your feet and make the best of life.
good,"lots of driving work overall is great but culture is less desirable ,management doesn't hire to fill lost employees lots of added work covering other peoples jobs.advancement is very minimal."
good,"I can not really give you a typical day because everyday brought fourth a new challenge and or a new fire to put out.  From rebuilding conveyor systems, wiring in a 480 motor, adjusting clave pressures, its something new everyday."
good,"The waste a lot of money, The M&A process here leave organizations in under the Stericycle name, but in now way actually part of Stericycle. Everyone of their divisions operates like a loosely associated franchise. It's a hard place to work, if you like to do things right the first time."
good,"This company can be a great place to work but they are missing something vital; the focus on the team. Too many initiatives, knee jerk reactions and lack of planning also contribute to a less than desirable workplace"
good,Have gained considerable knowledge of RCRA and NON-DOT regulations.  Constantly learning while working with environmental hazardous and pharmaceutical accounts.  Have knowledge in writing hazardous waste profiles and lab pack manifests and other pertinent paperwork that is required.
good,Company treats management like the enemy. The union runs the business. No discipline. We are just a number. The turn over is really bad.
good,While working here it was fun among the workers and some of the management it was different to work with the Dr. and patients it could sometime become slow but over all the position was fine the late hours i had to get use to
good,"I love what the do as a whole, but managment sucks. I learned alot with this company."
good,"Typical day at work includes talking on the phone with patients. Assisting with billing, scheduling, dealing with the insurance, collections, and problem solving. I have learned a lot while working here. I have taken multiple classes on insurance, medical terminology, HIPPA, and problem solving. I do not really like management at this company. I feel that they are not on the same page with how to manage. They all do their own thing. I feel that they are very good a fabricating situations to get people in trouble. I love all my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the hours. They are not flexible. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting patients."
good,The job is easy as long as your are comfortable with change. The people that work there are great. The management likes to micro-manage the employees. There isn't any diversity among management. There are issues with people being trained.
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,Waste destruction facility that would process medical waste for the province of Ontario.
good,A typical day at Stericycle required me to travel to various healthcare facilities across dade county to provide customer service and technical support to clients.I learned various skills and gained experience such as face to face and over the phone customer service and sales support.The hardest part of the job was working around the hazardous materials that I was responsible for.The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet new people at the different facilities .
good,"The company is good but the people running the Doral office are not doing the job correctly and they let go of good hard workers and brought in people who do not know anything about the industry and have no education. PLENTY of hospitals and clinics have INCREASED in their COMPLAINTS because their product is either incomplete, completely missing or belongs to another customer."
good,"job was ok, good equipment and boss was decent but the pay was way below the national pay grade for dealing with haz waste, different job daily and favortism strong between dispatch and senior drivers."
good,"They had no integrity, not to mention, treated me and a few others very poorly. They never had any supervisors in the warehouse, it was every man for himself and everyone has to act like each others supervisor and everyone starts arguing, I wouldn't reccomend for that particular reason, though it is an okay place to work if you're starting out  in the workforce."
good,When I was there they were giving 15 cents raises at your annual review. The hourly pay was $10 a hour. It probably has changed by now since the city minimum wage changed.
good,The typical day at work was 14 hours which included entering information on Salesforce at the conclusion of the work day. Online sales meetings were weekly and monthly in person sales meetings were conducted with the Operations Management to try to get an understanding of the needs of both the Sales staff and Operations staff to make our services run properly and to of course maintain a high level of customer satisfaction
good,Stericycle has a huge turn over rate because they don't want to pay employees equally. They only give a 3% raise annually but employees are trained throughout the year to learn new skills but they are not paid for these new skills. Would recommend Stericycle if you are young and don't plan on being with the company long.
good,the physical work was good hours were good and good pay.the culture was not so well. mangers and coworkers no doubt a no comment .you have to work there to see if the job is you needs.
good,The morale of employees was always low. There was a disconnect between employee & management .changes being made were affecting the production of the company
good,"High volume waste disposal place, under trained people in places,over worked senior people. Makes for a very volatile situation. It's just got to change"
good,Depending on the position you have you could go many places. I have learned to keep focused but take your time as to not make mistakes. Management is good about helping with problems when needed.
good,"Solid Sales Company"
good,"Management in my region was absolutely horrible. The routing was horrible, and no one really seemed to care anymore. We were always running out of supplies and not being given the tools to do our jobs."
good,"This could be a great place to work if they would weed out those who have a secret agenda. They preach customer first, but internally, its mostly about who likes who, and who has the most clout."
good,Reputable company with thousands of employees.  It is certainly one of the leaders in the industry.  Work culture is a lot of fun.  People are very easy going.
good,"Typical day, is getting up early to be there at 630am. Generally hit between 3-5 stops per day to collect retail hazardous waste and drop as needed. Lots of paperwork in addition to handling freight at the drop center. You also take on the role, of computer technician to keep your equipment up and running and restock supplies for the truck. That said, at days end, I was normally dead tired .. with no energy to do anything else. And ironically, raises are pretty small .. so get as much as you can upfront! One other thing .. high exposure to household chemicals, mainly from broken containers and accidental sprays .. so really the starting pay is well below what you may sacrificing, so use PPE!"
good,"Typical call center job, except in the medical field. Kind of like 911 but for after hours non emergency hospital patients. Call center environment equals micro managing to a certain degree."
good,"Very stressful work environment, very difficult boss to work for. Very demanding, micro management, new upper management very demanding. No outside life"
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,"Long Days "
good,"good company to work for ...they promote within but no training ..management needs to listen to work force ,,and let them have input to ideas of change ,,"
good,"there is so much change that they end up letting good mgrs go and keep bad ones.  "
good,"Regional Management not involved in developing lower-level management or supervisors. Low communication levels for productivity expectations, staff development and coaching"
good,"On boarding education class is not aligned with day to day work load, leaving more work for supervisors like myself, and continuing education is not operational. Agents are not trained and are doing a job they do not fully understand. Supervisors have received more responsibility without adequate training or compensation."
good,"Fast paced and can be stressful at times. Hard to  have a work / life balance. Evenings and weekend work required, since you are out in the field at accounts during business hours. Because territory could be broke up and distance  and time required to travel."
good,It was an ok job a lot of different things going on I wouldn't mind going back to work the hours was pretty good the pay was good training just long I would refer anyone
good,This is a decent place to work but they could offer better compensation for the work that is required. You can gain a lot of experience that you can take with you.
good,"Just a job, nothing special, company has grown to fast and is now experiencing a tremendous amount of issues due to unchecked greed."
good,Stericycle has a great team of hourly employees. They are what made my supervisory role so enjoyable. They work many hours and holidays. Sacrifice a lot of family time to ensure success for Stericycle. I would of like to see management take charge of eliminating overtime by being more involved in day to day planning. My direct boss was very compasionate when it came to family matters.I left because of low wage and to relocate.
good,"Stericycle is an reasonable place to start off to a good career, but make sure you do your research on a job before you agree to take it. The job slogan is, ""Protecting people and reducing risk"". But who exactly are we protecting? To be a fortune 500 company, I really expect way more from this job. I would recommend this job to someone who is just looking for steady work and is just getting on their feet in the real world. As far as advancement goes..... Just wait on it"
good,"easy job. answer phones and refer important information to proper source. laid back, no uniform. fun people, enjoyable work environment"
good,"A typical day involved preparing bids/proposals, providing pricing and evaluating profitability on products and services."
good,"A typical day at work is to route calls to the appropriate on call person. This company had a very strong management backing. My co-workers, locally, were awesome to work with. The hardest part of my job was trying to keep up with the call pace as each call came in.  There was a lot of pressure  to achieve goals that were almost unobtainable. The most enjoyable part of the job was speaking to different people from different states."
good,"Credit and collections for delinquent accounts. Maintained a multi million dollar account portfolio. Trained and developed team members and new managers. I was the first ever winner of the company's Big Fish award for providing exceptional service to customers, team members and other departments."
good,Coworkers were good but they needed guidance often. Employees will also need more help from management.
good,"It's not an exciting company to work at. It has gone under a lot of leadership changes which makes sense since the culture, stock price, and over all morale has declined over the 5-6 years I've been there. Maybe they will improve as they go complete the changes they have planned. Some of their processes don't make sense or are inefficient, but they do work to improve them. Not enough effort or consideration goes into implementing new ideas before enacting them. They are constantly fixing things."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,worked from home so not easy meeting people we worked in different states. Was an experience I will never forget. Being confined to you home does get to you. That is why I left the company to work in a visual customer friendly environment.
good,It is what it is with any company during a business transformation. Just need to make sure you're in the right department when they're transforming. The people I worked with were great though.
good,good place to work if not rushed into your truck without proper training! short handed long hours out town work not wanted monday through friday week ends off
good,Great job with great benefits just misleading on job duties . They are very culture orientated and believe in the five core values. Once your in your in they will work with you as well.
good,I enjoyed working for Stericycle and Shred-it in spite of the pressure and stress related to pricing and competition.  Rarely had service complaints or misses related to RMW.
good,"While Stericycles services are necessary for the environment and are certainly feel good,  leadership has yet to connect with its employees and customers to really make an impact."
good,"My favorite part of my job at Stericycle was working with the customers and co-workers.  The job itself was hard.  Physically demanding and risky working with needles, biohazard and hazardous waste.  My ability to problem solve and quickly address any problems the customers has is rewarding to me when they are happy with our services.  This job is so unique that only co-workers really understand all aspects of our jobs, so conversations and gatherings with said co-workers is rewarding as well."
good,"Got to the yard at 0600 most mornings and started prepping the trucks with whatever we will be using that day on the job site.  Connected with supervisor and talked about the job before had and location.  Hardest part of the job was long hours, most enjoyable was working along side people and having fun on the job."
good,Company has great potential. Their pay needs to be increased based on the amount of clients they train their agents to work with. Company helped me grow better in customer service. They're work from home opportunity is fair.
good,"Not a place to work for more than a few years, but if you are looking to break into the medical field as a sales representative, it's a good place to start."
good,"As Class 1 ADR Driver you can make some good money, however the work is ball bustin and they expect their pond of flesh. Its heavy dirty work and your expected out in all weathers. Be prepared to have a strong stomach too as some of the hospital waste is mingin especially in summer when its been sweating in plastic tubs for days on end."
good,"You will end up doing your job here and someone else's. People are lazy and dont take their job seriously. Most people at this location are not properly trained or qualified for their job duties. This puts alot of stress on 5 people that actually do a great job here. Management doesn't discipline insubordinate behaviour, attendance issues, tardiness or complete failure of responsibilities. Raises are too little too late. Environmental technicians are paid 20.3% below the national average at this facility.  Management lacks professionalism and transparency. If someone is threatened by your work ethic and subordinate behavior they will do their best to push you out the door by any means neccessary and management will back them. They need a full time position that will manage the employees and hold them accountable for their poor performance so management can complete other job duties. In short if you're a hard worker who comes to work TO WORK. stay away from here, it will stress you out and destroy your positive attitude. I thought coming here was a great opportunity but it turned out to be my greatest mistake. Right now I'm looking for alternatives. "
good,It was a nice job but we keep going through different management and it just wasn’t stable.  I learned a lot of different warehouse skills here.  We destroyed all medical waste at this facility.
good,"needs some improvement,,and need to fire some of them sups they are horrible and messy she only heard what she wanted and never helped when you needed her"
good,The environment is face paced and being efficiently productive is a requirement in order to stay within exceeding guidelines. Hardest part of the job is the high volume of work.
good,"The culture is prescribed, but loosely enforced. Senior leadership seems to be very unorganized, which makes it hard to focus on the real issues that need to be addressed."
good,"Once a great company to work for with fantastic benefits, I met some of the most dedicated,visionary, and knowledgeable professionals in this growing industry. "
good,"the staff was too young and greedy skimming money out of the petty cash that was there for work purposes so they didn't like when we did overtime because they felt like they were loosing money by having to pay us the overtime yet they never said it , it was well known by regular employees other than that they had me doing jobs that wasn't on my job description and entitled me using my own vehicle and going out of state and out of town and they didn't want to pay for my gas to travel."
good,was awesome while it lasted but new management and buying out the competition made things for existing employees and made cuts in employees cost. New manager was looking to cut cost due to the buy out.
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,"Blue collar job where the quality of worker is low, and turnover is high. Management can't relate to workers. Best part of the job is early finish time. Hardest part of the job is having a reason to do it well."
good,Was a good place to work. The past 3 years the place has gone downhill. Constant butting heads with a computer program called Roadnet built with a car gps. Asked to drive in suburb roads with no truck routes.Drivers are miserable told how to run a route after 20 years working there. Different start times everyday.Stericycle pushes safety hard. But ask there drivers to go as fast as possible with biohazard in back. Garbage men in Illinois make 35 a hour. A guy in Wisconsin makes 15 a hour  picking up the stuff u don't want to see at the hospital. On the plus side though they do give good vacation time. If you have class A you can get a lot of overtime also. You get used to the smell and purrell on the hands a lot. Honestly the people aren't bad its the way they continue run it.
good,"cold calling "
good,There are some things that I would like to change about the job. There was a recent change in management that has me looking for other employment. There are compensation issues that we are now also struggling with.
good,The hatfield division is bad place to work especially under ralph garrillo he is the worst manager i ever had  he is unfair and condescending follows the rules when it suits him and don't when it doesn't .I would still work for stericycle if was not for him stericycle is a great place to work except under ralph garillo if it wasn't for ralph i would not have looked for other work
good,"Starting at 7am is not bad but your expected to do an unreasonable amount of work with little to no help. I did get forklift certified here, management is as bad as employees. The culture seems to be lazy, no one wanted to work. the hardest part was dealing with lazy co-workers and managers, the best part was breaks."
good,"We sterilized all things the hospital and labs couldn't throw in regular trash. Had to get use to the small, but after that i was fine. got to use my supervisor and leadership skills there, just wasn't enough pay."
good,Overall the company strives for excellence through the use of the latest technologies.  Almost all interactions are done through email; one to one interaction either personal or by telephone is rare.  Younger employees might enjoy the company culture but more established employees may find the culture trivial.  The difference is whether one feels they need to receive an ata-boy when they perform there job function.
good,"I very much liked the people i worked with everyday and always had laughs, but when it came to the nasty job, nobody liked it at all.It was a medical waste plant so you can see why we disliked the job itself."
good,"Stericycle is great place to work for. The job is fairly easy and is the same day in and day out. The pay is decent, could use some increase but compared to the area it is ok. The health and vision benefits are awesome. Down falls for this location is the amount of overtime you are required to work. You don't really get a good balance of work and family time. Most weekend and holidays are spent at work. If you do happen to get the holiday off, be prepared to work the following weekend. Not much room for advancement. Management has very little regard to employees personal life. They spend every weekend at home while we worked. Seem to know the reasons behind all the overtime but show no advance to improve the problem."
good,Stericycle emphasizes a customer first atmosphere and is continually involved in process improvements. They provide training blocks to learn about additional leadership skills and knowledge on other areas of interest.
good,We work for an answering service for different local business and some out of state. We answer 24 hrs a day and 365 days a yr answering between 100 calls to 200  calls a day. It can be challenging but able to maintain steady flow of customer service and troubleshooting issues.
good,"I became better a communicating with a lot of people. Came out of my comfort zone. Good opportunity to build your experience as far as installments, traveling and building yourself as a person."
good,"At that time I was working there and was a single mother with 2 children and going to school at the same time. I will admit I was late some day by5 or 7 minutes. By me having to put my child on the bus and the other by my mother. I was a very outgoing person still is, but I just think, with my situations and I work myself off."
good,It's OK!!! It's a job NOT a career!!!!! But for the most part the work isn't hard!!! A lot of drama!!! No room for growth!!! The pay needs improvement!!!
good,Management in the warehouse good friendly people. Staff are good workers and helpful. Dusty areas are a concern at times although protective equipment is available. Opportunity to work independently on a day to day bases is there.
good,"too much to do with a low pay, management is not all that great benefits are so so, great co-workers but too much gossip, over night shift sucks, no raise for bi-lingual people, raise is upon performance and capabilty, but with new owner it's only one pay rate. no pto check out; you either use it when it's possible or lose it."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,Good company to work for. Unfortunately plant management is not good.
good,"Work was busy and productive, I learned how to quickly and accurately enter data into the computer.  Some of my co-workers were young and immature, and kept up confusion at times, which made the job difficult at times."
good,"I have acquired a multitude of skill sets that make me versatile to any situation or environment! my strong suit is communication and getting task done on a timely and efficient manner! this job requires good communication skills rapid adjustments: if necessary, and being very cautious dealing with work materials! job was enjoyable because of the people you meet when going site to site!"
good,"Chego as 07:30 ligo o computador abro os nossos sistemas,faço cadastro fola com o cliente recebo orientação dos gerentes e da coordenadora de contratos a fim de executar as minhas atividades com prefeição."
good,A typical day at work is over seeing all aspects of daily plat operations. I have learned how to run auto claves and boilers.
good,A typical day at work was spent at my desk posting credits for recall clients. I learned alot about the recall industry and all the various people and steps it takes in order to get credited for a recalled product. Management included many good people who were not trained to do there job which in turn makes it very difficult for employees to do there job correctly. My co-workers were very nice and we made a great team. The hardest part of my job was the constant chaos of trying to push through all of the unknown aspects that no one had answers too. The most enjoyable part my job was team atmosphere and having wonderful people to add support through the learning process of the position.
good,This was a temporary position through Volt. It was a repetitive motions job more than a data entry job. I have trouble with these kind of positions and would not have taken the position had I known.
good,"Receive incoming call from doctors, hospitals, patients, etc. attempting to reach an on call doctor or forward a message to the office via fax or email. The call center is a small area where each employee knows one another and often spends time together after work. I most enjoy my coworkers and pay."
good,long days but seen alot of interesting things enjoyed talking with customers
good,"While initially I had very high regards for the company, there are some things that have changed, both for better and for worse, but unfortunately the better does not seem to be outweighing the worse."
good,Had great benefits. Management changed often and communication with employees was poor. Pleasant working environment and enjoyed the schedule flexibility.
good,Importante esfuerzo por unificar las diferentes lineas de servicios; de ahi la necesidad de crear la Gerencia que dirijo
good,I am a goal oriented type of individual who is looking for s company that I can grow internally with. I am very ambitious and harf working and enjoy learning new things.
good,"Typical Day at Work - Busy, always different, always interesting"
good,They are always looking for people to hire. The problem is nobody wants to work here. People get hired on and within 2days you don’t see them anymore.
good,"Direct Field Management is very good, current direction of the company is unknown. Supervision consistently services accounts due to incorrect capacity analysis figures swaying upper management's decision to hire."
good,"As a SMS Service Technician you are expected to service hospitals and take care of multiple product streams.   This particular position has no set end time... you work until the job is done... some days that's a good thing.. some days it can be a very long day. Limited support as a Service Specialist,  you do have management but usually you're onsite at facility and are expected to service that facility by you9."
good,A typical day involves working from 6:00 am until 7:30 pm and on call 24/7. Fun loving culture but each person is on there own to succeed. The management isn't trained on the supervisors job duties so they can't provide solutions.
good,"Was laid off June 1 2018, without warning. Spent too many nights out of town, as compared to my coworker, who did the same job. It should’ve been 50/50 but was more like 90/10. When I spoke to my terminal manager, he agreed it was unfair, but problem wasn’t corrected. I enjoyed my time there, except for the unfair travel. I was told, I’d spend 3-4 nights a month out, I was spending at least half of my time out."
good,"Great place to work.  My supervisor very was understanding and truly cared when situations came up.  Too bad the company is downgrading, and letting everyone go."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,"Stericycle can be a fun place to work, but very stressful. They are always short handed and there is no one to back you up if you need time off. They offer great benefits and good hours for office employees."
good,"This would've been an excellent place to work, if the supervisor were not playing favorites.  Working there became undesirable after some workers were hired.  They began to bully and intimidate other employees.  The enviornment is friendly but the department was temporary and bias."
good,"Going through a business transformation"
good,The best aspect of my former position was interacting with the customer's on my route. I enjoyed interacting with my coworkers. Hardest part was management.
good,Little clear direction from the top.  Monthly financials lacked detail and accurcy necessary to be at all useful.  Organizational culture is deteriorating.
good,"It's a good place to work as long as you find a system, work the system and collaborate well with your co-workers towards that system. It's a very physical job and you're exposed to the elements, so naturally every once in awhile, everyone ""WILL"" get on each other. Management does what they can but you can only do so much with what you have; Needs a full crew, both yard and drivers to combat the ever increasing workload."
good,Most of the people that I worked with while here were great team players. The issue came down to management. When you have a staff that is willing to do anything for a company but a management staff that is not willing to see things through it makes it difficult for the staff to help the customers.
good,"It was a good place to work for until a bigger company came and bought us out,they made us show them everything then fired all of us and relocated,it was steady work"
good,"For me a typical work day was 8-5 answering phones and taking care of emails."
good,"This Job works you like a dog, most of the time your in the cold, and around all sorts of hazardous chemicals. If your lucky they will start you at 14.50 and you may or may not get a raise in a year depending on how long it takes the management to do their job."
good,Good people and atmosphere. A bit unorganized and at times lack of direction. Opportunity to learn new things. Culture peaked and has since gone in the wrong direction. Good stock options and 401k plan
good,"Stericycle is a good, cultured place to work.  There were issues of communication and management collaboration, mainly due to the nature of buying smaller companies and placing them together.  However, Stericycle has good people and many positions."
good,A typical work day for me is getting rid of at least 100 drums in 8 hours.In the past 3 years I have learned to drive bob tale trucks.I learned to drive the back hoe very well.I learned various chemicals and how to ship them in properly.I worked lap pack QaQc and also shipping. Management at the location is the worse I wouldn't tell anyone to work under them. The hardest part about my job is dealing with management and their bad communication skills. The most enjoyable part for me is that I get to learn new things.
good,It's not a bad place to work I just find it really hard to understand why it takes them hours to generate new passwords for employees.  had this problem and it was really annoying
good,Just was not a family friendly environment with sudden changes in hours and less than standard training. Fairly steady hours but micromanaged with no real authority for the leads. Leads assume more responsibility with no additional compensations.
good,"Wonderful place to work if you enjoy working in an office setting. The job is a sit down position that works for any person, even if you have a disability."
good,"im just not really a big fan of being around needles. the management was horrible. the pay was decent. you work at your own pace and by yourself. i liked working there, but i just could not deal with the unorganzied management and supervisors."
good,"good, people with easy work load. Just only down side was staying sick all the time, cause there was so many of us in one area. Other then that great company."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,"Poor training! Hired to replace a demoted manager, who was then left to do my training. No longer a team atmosphere with Stericycle takeover. Everyone for themselves and left to figure it out on your own."
good,"Account Manager/Compliance Specialist for Southern GA territory providing compliance based program improvement training.  Conducted presentations and skills fairs training to meet with JACHO, OSHA, EPA and DOT compliance and best practice standards."
good,"The job was great for the 14 years.I made a effort to learn everything I listened and work hard with my team members.This effort put me out of a job. I said thank you, and left with my professionalism and mypositive attitude.Great reviews every year,several promotions not one write up and I was let go with no explanation."
good,Metric driven sales process with new Leads to call on every month. Fun people to work with to make you look forward to going to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it challenged my analytical skills because the industry is so dynamic and you learned something new everyday.
good,Overall satisfactory. A lot of work with not enough support. You spend 1/4 of your week on needless conference calls. You need to be self motivated and figure our things on your own if u plan on working for this company at a 3rd party locations. My job is very different from everywhere else however. I feel they didn't do enough research on this acquisition before the job started. I am months into it and still have a lot of unknowns. It's a fight bw the Site I work at and with our company to establish any processes.  Pay is decent though.
good,"Depending on which team you belong there (there are about 12 small quantity sales divisions inside) your expectations vary slightly."
good,"Unloading and dumping trash, I've learned about all the biohazards in the place, the management is ok but it's hard to get them to do what's right and the hardest part is loading the line in the heat wave. the most enjoyable part is getting your pay after you have worked long hours, it's worth it."
good,"Stericycle is a stable company but, if you are in the corporate arena you are expected to be pretty much on call. There is also a lot of promotions for men when women are more skilled and competent for the same position."
good,"A good solid company to work for with adequate benefits. Very hard, physical work but if you stick around you will make some money. As for moving up, unless you are tight with the boss you can forget about it. I have been there 25 plus years and still haven't been able to move up into management after several attempts. Good Ol' Boy network at it's finest."
good,"The management was nice, pay wasnt enough for what you were doing yes you pick up biohazard containers. You service morgues, funeral homes etc, you pick up body parts everything except the head and chest. But for me the hardest part of the job was going into the cancer treatment facilities and seeing the sick people. And the smell is horrible"
good,"Back break work day to day.some room to move in company,management looks out for management.Some co-workers are others get away with everything.Hardest work lift overweight containers over and causeing back problems."
good,My typical day at work was answering inbound call to assit customers with there invoice's and schedule pick up
good,"It was a fine place to work. My boss was really nice and they supported me through tough times. I dont regret working there at all! Blah blah blah, blah."
good,"trabajo diverso y rutas establecidas segun las necesidades del usurario sector de la salud, el manejo de desechos medicos no deben ser manipulados por peligro de contaminacion"
good,"Fair company to work for. Small call center, communication not always consistent. Family like atmosphere, employee feedback requested. All in all lots of potential for growth."
good,"Hostile work environment, poor management, poor communication on each level, unrealistic goals with constant staffing issues. Stressful, I personally feel some things are out of code with OSHA standards."
good,Enjoyed the pace of the work and the clients I met.  Overtime was easy to get as there was lot of work.  Drivers supported each other and overall driving was what I enjoyed the most.
good,Overall decent place to work but in need of more opportunities to grow in the company. In need of better local management. Pay is decent and good OT when available.
good,Call center has great employee vibes a lot of us get along and it makes the day's go by faster. We enjoy our company monthly potlucks that we have and events.
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,"Stericycle is a good company to start your career. There are many departments where a person can grow, build a lot of knowledge and increase their skills."
good,"Ok place to work.  Job is easy,  but there is a huge lack in planning.   The over all management of the company is atrocious.   No payroll present,  no HR present."
good,"Work environment became more about numbers and graphs. It became more about how many calls were made in a day, how long you were on each call, and how much down time there was in between calls. They also wanted detailed notes on accounts with certain verbiage and everything to be initialed. All this was being individually monitored. When scheduling one customer for several locations, there was timely computer work to be completed, resulting in too much down time, not to mention counting as only one call, which brings your daily count down. Consultants like things done on their accounts and calendars a certain way in order to provide a service to their customer when the customer has set aside time. Numbers and graphs don't provide good customer service."
good,Great paying job . Great hours . Not fun to drive  Hilo out side but n cold weather . Great learning experience nice work employees and environment...
good,"Superiors are not helpful as far as growth opportuntites with the company."
good,Always something new to learn. A typical day is managing to keep up with any changes the company brings. Handling  each call in the most professional matter. Every day the call flow can be different. Management is very professional and make this a fun working environment.
good,"Stericycle struggles to keep a Traffic Manager, there’s not too much communication, and now that there is a new management in place, all of a sudden there are a plethora of rules to be enforced. No one seems to know what they’re doing, and when you mess up they look at you."
good,"I enjoyed working for Stericycle for many years. I total enjoyed working with fellow employees. The wages and other Benefits were wonderful."
good,It's too bad the company has had so many changes in a short period of time. Now its the green UPS. More and more executives from UPS joining and turning it into the UPS Midwest.
good,This is a good company to work for. The team members work hard and they there is good upward movement for those who choose. The organization is going through a lot of change and TM's are uneasy about the future path.
good,The call center would be busy some days and calls rates slow other days. That was a typical call center. I met great people there. The hardest part of the job is when a customer calls with an issue beyond your control. finding a supervisor is help on time is hard because they are busy all the times.
good,I liked the work.  The down side was a 30 mile commute in HORRIBLE traffic.  The people were great.  I was happy to help out as needed with whatever projects
good,"A typical day starts at 1pm and ends around 10pm.  The group of guys i work with are a fair group, but i often feel as though i am not being led in the right direction as far as advancement within the company is concerned. i want to obtain my class A license in order to drive trailers, i am aware that i would have to be with the company for some time before i can obtain that license, because i do not intend to stay there solely as a warehouse associate. i would feel more comfortable being able to talk to my coworkers who have been there for some time, but i feel as though some of them are giving me the run around in order to keep me in the same position that they are in themselves. Would also like to see the morale of my coworkers be higher"
good,Schedule appointments with physicians and nurses for patient care. The most difficult would be trying to schedule appointments for critical care Work culture is ok
good,Good atmosphere to work in. Had been busy with projects back to back which is good. Had fun activities. Managers are nice and made sure the employees are comfortable..
good,"If you work in dispatch it stressful all day. And if you're a driver, sometimes the plant will be behind and that will put you behind making your day a long one"
good,"Company has many changes every year.  It is difficult to keep up with the changes from time to time. The turn over is high but your job is secure if you can stay within the guidelines.  The work is simple enough, working for my office all the office is remote and works from home.  The most difficult part of work is the lack of an office, makes communication a bit more difficult than expected.  Management is hit or miss, you can typically get in contact with them through email more of the time which is the most reliable for of communication. Working from home is extremely convenient but can get really boring."
good,The wages are not at a level to live well in a metropolitan area. Wages should take into account the role and responsibilities as well as the costs of housing.
good,"Park 18 wheeler, maintain a safe and sanitary environment, dump hazardous waste in the proper bins, move and load hazardous wastes under direction of supervisor, load and unload products from trailers using forklift trucks and other material handling equipment, store the products in proper places in warehouse"
good,The job was very fast and a lot of work. I like that. Manager in my location didn't really know what was going on. Better management is needed. other than that I liked it.
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,"I applied for a route driver. The ad said non cdl. But the manager told me right away a class b is required. He said they advertise that way because truckers with a cdl dont want to work here driving a straight truck. The pay is 15 to start and 16 after obtaining a cdl. Your raise is every year at only 3 percent. He said he's never seen a raise over 5 percent. You probably won't have any days off either."
good,"Kent office has a very relaxed environment. Management there is the best! Very friendly staff and helpful coworkers. Management truly shows trust in their staff and allow you to work, listening to music as long as work gets done."
good,"Fast paced, heavy lifting, long hours, supervisor buys lunch on occasion and for birthdays, understanding employer, when you need time off for what ever reason there understanding"
good,This is a good company to qork for it ia fast pace and really easy all u have to really worry about is the smell of thw bio beinf thrown away other thwn that a good place of work
good,Great company and really great benefits if you are there for the long haul.  Unfortunately do not expect a tremendous amount of support or movement as far as advancing in the company if you start in the call center.  For the most part that is where you will find yourself for your career path and very difficult to work your way up and out of that environment.
good,"Very fasted pace office environment"
good,A empresa em si e o que ela oferece é maravilhoso mas a gerente da sede de Uberlândia não era profissional.
good,"The pay is pretty good, the health insurance is really good, and they give you a considerable amount of paid vacation and sick days. The hours can be long and you never know when you will have to work the weekend."
good,Management has no communication but the guys on the floor doing all the real work are cool to work. Also super hot in the warehouse but try give a lot of overtime
good,"good for the moment, not long term pay, something for the moment, nice friendly people, paid bi-weekly, open 24 hours in some departments, everybody wants to know your business"
good,"we pick up medical waste from hospitals. my route was in winston salem, burlinton ,charlotte. we mon thur friday . my day started at 4 and ended around 3."
good,customer service rep. 8 hours a day. having to sit for long periods of time. Taking calls via telephone. Using Active listening and communication skills is a Plus. Mostly fast paced and busy
good,Not my favorite place to work but not the worst either.. the pay is unfair but that is not the fault of direct management. I recommend it for people trying to get into the corporate world.
good,"Very early morning arrive time and loading of truck was not always ready. Carts were not available of truck was not ready. Considered morning time too strenuous. Work hours were long. When returning to warehouse to unload carts, not always easy to remove carts."
good,Overall my job went smoothly most of the time. I learned that never put yor time in a company and theres lack of communication. Most of all I liked my job.
good,Working in Lake Forest was wonderful - 90% of the senior leadership is great with a few bad apples mixed in.  Lots of transformation happening which will be great down the road.
good,Shred-It/Stericycle is a good place to be if you're looking for a fast-paced work environment. There is a lot of opportunity for advancement if your willing to work hard.
good,I learned a lot working for this company lot mostly taught me good customer service skills I enjoyed the people I worked with and the purpose of working for this company.
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,"Loved my manager and team, but not my favorite company. Selling structure needs to change, but last I heard was in the process. Environment is great and so are the people."
good,"Stericycle should place strong focus on better training of their employees with the proper way to sell their products and services to their customers, as well as, how their employees should treat their customers."
good,Good place to work. Acceptable pay and strong team members that are very knowledgeable. Opportunities for advancement. Respectable treatment from bosses.
good,"company is ok to work for"
good,"The company is overall okay to work, a lot better than some places in the workforce. They have good benefits and discounts. My issue with them would be that 1) managers aren't always readily avaliable for assistance and they don't know much. 2) The job culture and morale can be low quite often. They don't do anything fun for everyone. 3) The treatment amoungst some of us aren't always distributed out fairly. 4) The company makes you jump thru hoops to receive a raise that is only 30 cents every year. Rarely you will get anything above that unless you meet their criteria of going above and beyond which can be in my opinion infeasible. You have to take calls perfectly according to their grading rubric, you have to deal with over 1000 different accounts with their clients, they stay having monthly competitions(which don't have good incentives) that are suppose to bring hte morale up but all it does it pit the employees against each other and make others feel bad, etc.. This job will make you have a tough skin all the way around, so if you suffer from anxiety, stres, etc, this might not be the job for you. I'd give the company a C+ overall."
good,"over all its a decent place to work, it has it's stressful moments. I think if you don't ever mess up on a call, you'll be find, Cause their clients are more important, after all, no client to answer for no employee to hire."
good,"As a CSR you were required to complete so much work per day, but, you were not made aware of the fact that the management is paid by the number of employees they can get to work on any particular project. The more people on any given project, the quicker it gets done, the more money they make as we finish ahead of schedule."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company it is very cultural, so many backgrounds and everyone in my shift worked well together and you could always request help and receive an immediate response"
good,The best part of work were the people. Learned a lot about the industry. Every manager had a different style of working. There was a lot of favoritism in the company.
good,"Fun place to work, management is very engaging "
good,"Hot in the summer,and cold in the winter.you would get uniforms,working was kinda laid back,nobody really bothers as long as your working.company outings were great."
good,This job is perfect to develop call center experience. Helps you to be able to get experience in a call center environment and helps you learn how to multi-task.
good,Good place to work.  There is a lot you can learn.  Must be team oriented. There is a lot of down time where there is not much work to do.  They don't mind that. Just keep asking if there is something you can do.
good,a good company to start a route driving career it gives you the opportunity to work on your professionalism as well as give your company a good look with customers
good,I usually don't have anything bad to say about my jobs but some statements were misleading and I signed on for a day shift position and was told that's what I would be getting. That was not the case. I did really enjoy the work and the co workers just wish there would of not been the run around with shift changes.
good,Overall the company was excellent to work for but there go thru temp services so high turnover rate. Breaks was short but frequent Most likely would recommend if permanent positions available.
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,"the supervisors are suportive with every quiries we had, the people working there are all friendly.  I only find the send people home part when theres low volume of calls as a down fall"
good,Most days were typically fast-paced. I learned a lot about working with customers as well as the computer programs. My position allowed me to become very independent and self-motivated. The hardest aspect of the job was dealing with irritated customers but the people I was able to work with made it an enjoyable place to work.
good,A lot of things to do always busy. You work with bio waste so you need to be careful. The days are long. You must always keep up with your paperwork and fill it out correctly.
good,load/unload medical waste. disposing everything that comes from hospitals from needles to blood. long hours great benefits from medical to 401k. great staffing and paid vacation.
good,I'll leave this open to the individual but I had a really great time with the company just  irreconcilable differences made the job at the end extremely difficult and stressful but overall most of the people are good and a good place to work .
good,Friendly people in somewhat laid back atmosphere.  Good benefit package.  Opportunity for advancement if you're willing to relocate.  Challenging long hours.
good,"Low stress made out to be a high stress job with poor communication between agents and management team. Culture team does great to boost morale, great work/home balance. Sometimes they take on contracts that require too many people and it requires us to have to utilize the shuttle bus they provide and park our cars far away from the parking lot. Pay is not adequate for the amount of information we have to retain. Little room for advancement  opportunities unless you are in the right department."
good,I learned alot of new things from working there. I worked with good co-workers and i would say the best part of the day would be lunch when you get to rest from the heat.
good,"Great company to work for.  The boss is great, hours and pay is great as well.. Chose my own hours to work.. Very flexible with employees if anything came up far as an appointment or something."
good,"Its a call center, you answer the phones and help people with their items that are on recall. some are friendly, some are not. you learn how to help everyone."
good,"The hardest park was unloading the Clay machine with the forklift grabbing the bins and dumping dem with da forklift "
good,All my co-workers were fun to work with. My manager was really care for of his employees. I enjoyed to work for him because he treated me right.
good,hard working job. lots of hours learning experience. the hardest part is smell but you get use to it. long hours one break. great people. will work with you time of needs
good,Many hours required.  High stress level. Many system to work in.  Maturity of office is very young.  Highly dedicated people though.
good,Stericycle is focus on an important need within healthcare. All waste streams within healthcare must be managed within the state and federal regulations. This is an important and complicated task. Stericycle has become an industry leader in this field.
good,Clock into work process orders hardest part of my job was the environment and the way  I was trained and the way I was treated ffrom my peers to the supervisors.Stressful yet productive.
good,"I enjoyed the daily duties of opening and organizing the office area, answering phones, printing and reviewing route drivers paperwork."
good,"I honestly don't think this company care about its employees. Management adds to your job without notice and will not compensate you for it. As an employee of this company, I have only been given a bonus from a former manager whose department i didn't even work in."
good,Downfall:  Inconsistent quota with too many changes in compensation in very short amount of time.  Also unable to maintain and retain employees including managers.
good,Company could use more training in selecting their training staff and lead agents. The hardest  part of the job is learning how to deal with irate customers.  What I learned was not to take this job serious. The over turn of employees is great.  The company cannot seem to hold on to their good employees.  Too much down time between calls.
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,"like the hours, locations, pay...hardest part was the sales and some of the policies, the management was ok. Ive learned to process meds"
good,"physical working conditions including loading and unloading trailers."
good,Employed under Stericycle but most interaction with St. Louis City Government. Relied heavily on individual effort to run facility.
good,"Great business culture. Supportive environment, great management but your hours are not guaranteed if you are not management and you never know when you will be laid off due to a shortage of allotted hours."
good,At nights we would have mechanical issues and management would go home early so production would sometimes come to a holt. Benefits were great. A typical day was I would have to load bens full of bio hazardous waste into cookers for decontamination and then empty them and then return them to be refilled and the process would start all over again.
good,Fun place to work. the most enjoyable part of working at stericycle is the fact that I have my own space and do my own thing with very little supervision. My co-workers are friendly and ready to help when needed.
good,"A great environment to work in. A typical day at work I load and unload trucks, fill out all necessary paperwork. Working at this company I learned teamwork skills. The hardest part of the job is the heavy workload. the most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to work outside. Management is reliable and supportive. If there are any issues the problem is addressed within a short amount of time."
good,"Great learning experience"
good,Normally very fast paced.  I enjoyed working for this company. I learned about Hazardous waste and laws and regulations that accompany dealing with hazardous waste.  Most enjoyable part of my job was it was a very laid back company.
good,It is a good job after High School to begin saving money but as a career it is only average. Hard to move ahead by much on the pay scale.
good,"Provide support to Team Members and Manager. Monitoring activity of operations and service levels. Document anything involving agent incidents, client impacts, and submit daily shift reports.Maintain break schedules. Document error and host coaching sessions if needed. Designing future Education material for Education specialist based in Indianapolis. Provide client support and creating resolutions that is best suitable pertaining to clients needs."
good,The work is fairly easy but dangerous there is just no room for advancement and the standard for workers is not fair....
good,is drop and pickup waste  and prepare manifest  log hrs and figure best route to use while doing my stops the harest is the hours the most enjoyable getting of but im thankful to hasve a job
good,I was at call center then went warehouse to do data entry which was great consistent work
good,Good company that teaches you to react to business changes in a hurry.
good,had a number of customers to pick up from on a daily route.from dentel office to doctor office.
good,lonely long drives back and forth gave me time to think and sort out issues co workers were cool 
good,Typical day consisted of routine routing. I learned the basics to the Bio-waste industry. The industry required the ability to make last minute service changes.
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,"Service multiple hospital everyday bases, manage bio hazard material"
good,"If you are not supposed to throw it away in the regular garbage, then bring it to us."
good,Great experience with the team and management. Good salary and highly recommend people to apply to this wonderful organization which provide excellent opportunities
good,"The only complaint I have would be their Marketing Services. I was hired for scheduling and then they added on MS training. Without a pay raise. It was the only thing I hated, having to ask callers for so much information just to get them a date or a phone number or sometimes there wasn't any information to give back to them. They would get upset and curse you out or humiliate you for trying to do your job.  I would take any position that didn't have to deal with Marketing Services."
good,The job is requires a lot of your time due to routes. Not customer service friendly. Job has changed from years past. It just doesn't seem driver friendly anymore.
good,When I first started we had great management it was a little crazy but it was understandable then we got a new manager who didn’t care and would have you drive six hours out of your area to go cover some stops when there are stops to be done in your area
good,"Starting wage is DOE, base pay is around $15/hr. It’s pretty quick-paced, and everything is tracked electronically. The environment and atmosphere is pretty laid back, if you’re doing what you’re supposed to, you won’t have management breathing down your neck. The job is very physical. Great for someone who’s either in shape, or wants to get in shape. We do a lot of lifting, and stacking."
good,Good company but too many transformations. Too much travel and territories to big for sales reps. The most enjobable part of the job was having flexible work hours.
good,"My shift was early, at four in the morning, it was a fast paced job and it was easy going if the team cooperated and shared the work load. If not, the day would turn into a heavy stressful day due to the fact that some people don't go with the intentions of working even though that's what they get paid to do, this kind of energy just brings stress because the people who'd work hard to leave would have to give the extra effort in order to be able to go home. I was one of those hard workers, people shouldn't have to carry the teams work load and then get talked down about it once they bring the same energy around. The management was poor, people would get away with hardly working and boast about it like it was something to be proud of. All in all ending the shift was the best feeling, there's nothing like being able to enjoy your day after a hard days work."
good,"this is a great opportunity for individuals who want to work from home and require minimal supervision and job awareness "
good,"Would go into work , start the day off by doing the same thing everyday,  burning hazardous hospital waste. The management was great. They were willing to work with you if there was a problem. The hardest part of the job was dealing with all the chemicals that were being burned."
good,"decent people, you can make decent money. flexible work schedule. undergoing a major company restructuring right now. i wouldnt work here for too long though."
good,"Company grew too fast and did not anticipate the issues associated with numerous acquisitions and mergers.  It was obvious that senior management is not accustomed to how a formal, established, large corporation should be guided and supported and has led to a very insecure and chaotic environment.  This is a shame as it was a great company 3 years ago with a bright future.  Only time will tell now."
good,"Good job, I would work there again, but I would hate to start all over, because they really make you work for the raises and look for any reason to reduce the amount of the raise."
good,nice work place but you can be working and have a nice schedule with good hours one minute and not have a job for months the next.
good,"This company cares about their employees. They are focused on growth and taking care of customers. It is a very high stress job, but pays ok for the time you put in."
good,The GM of the company is one of the best bosses I have ever had partly the reason  I'm still there the some of the supervisors and TL under her could use some work but they are not all bad. The pay is getting better but we are still one of the lowest paid call centers in the area. The training process is suffering a bit since i first stared some times they are putting people out on the floor too quickly. I wish they would hire more people that cared more about their jobs instead of gossiping on the floor and I wish they would be more careful about who they elevate to positions of power. I like the new policies that they have implemented when they are enforced properly they work well. I take great pride in the fact that we help people everyday. This is a good company its just something's could stand to be worked on but still I would recommend people to work here its a good get on your feet job.
good,"In a typical workday I make between 80-120 outbound cold calls to both current and prospective Stericycle customers.  I identify customer needs, make relevant product/service level recommendations, overcome objections, and close the sale.  I used value-based and consultative sales tactics to overcome various objections and close the deal in as short a sales cycle as possible."
good,had its ups and downs....sometimes seemed like management was tooo focused on the job and wanted 100% of employees times and energy not caring about things going on outside of work
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,"Fun workplace, supervisors are nice and understandable. Not all about numbers, more-so quality, Big cafeteria, with free coffee."
good,set trailers up. load and rearrange. Deliver products to customers. I like to take care of my customers.
good,"This job is not for everyone.  It takes a certain personality and sense of urgency to a successful operator.  My day at work would be dependent on our clients' day at work.   If they have a busy day, most likely I will.  I would speak to a wide range of people throughout the day, from professionals to homeless people.  My co-workers are more like my teammates. Management was always professional but sometimes inept to new ideas.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different people of all backgrounds.  The hardest part of the job, which is not very difficult, is maintaining a positive attitude throughout the day.  Speaking to a shade under 300 people daily, one would occasionally come across some stressful situations.  I would say this job is stressful and again, not for everyone."
good,This is the work place where other employees cares about other employees. Love working with the staff.
good,"I answered phones and helped customers.  I made ready the routes for 4 drivers, put in hours for payroll, answered the employee questions about benifits.  The local management was good, but the corporate management were not.  Not getting all the information needed for the job.  Getting  ready the dirvers routes."
good,"Compensation is good, but they lack constancy of purpose. Big focus on profit, not so much on meeting or exceeding customer requirements."
good,"Great place to build customer service skills, some flexibility to take care of things outside work and opportunites for growth. Supervisors with teams/agents are fair upper management is distant. Fast paced constantly changing environment."
good,"We worked on different events on a day to day basis. Once I received my location it was time to sort and process the non-controlled product. This intel some data entry and verification. The job also consisted of heavy lifting, squatting, and bending."
good,"a typical day at work was fun. I learn how to drive trucks,scan waste and work the control panel for dumping the waste to be burn.The managers has always kept things in order.my co-workers were the best we always communicated and we always talk about sports in what was going on the world.The hardest part about my job was going on a lunch break. The most enjoyable part of the job was everybody spoke to each other and respected one another"
good,Some business units were exceptional at keeping the employees happy all while maintaining production and quality.  Everyone took pride in their job and did their best to succeed.
good,Not a bad job if you're into sales. It's really based on the territory you get that will make or break you hitting your commission target. Each manager manages differently so meaning team requirements it based on your manager.

The hardest part was working overnight and wanting to work the day shift."
good,The company and management was would find any reason to take money out of your pocket so they could get more money in their. They do not know how to talk to people. The pay is not good for the work  that you have to do

good,"only for hardworking people...Heavy lifting, bad smells, some do more work than others... no reward, working in real cold or real hot weather must be motivated!"
good,"Normal hours 8 to 4:30. The higher up management are extremely fair and kind. Lower management, not so much. In sales you are only what you make for the month. Quotas are raised when lead capturing decreases and then It’s your fault for not making numbers. Great team of people and the ability to make good money, but the leads vs the amount you have to sell to make bonus is outrageous.Lower supervisors are unreasonable and do not stick Up for their teams needs over their own reputation"
good,All agents were in offices company was bought out all agent were sent home very eazy low maintenance job answering calls no cold calling. Overall OK company to work for.
good,"Was a good company years back but they are growing to fast to still support there systems/sites. They do pay considerably well. Management is at a loss, Some were good,"

good,"Stericycle is a friendly place to work. The people are warm and welcoming and try to make it a comfortable working environment. However, they do not compensate their employees as if they value them. They require employees to manage large work loads any try to off-set it by offering lunches and fun meetings, but when it comes to actually taking care of the well-being of their employees, they drop the ball."
good,"typical day consists of driving to facility (on your own time) arriving at facility and working at your own pace with little or no supervision from upper management. your work speaks for itself and if you do your job properly  and meet the needs of the hospital or facility in which you are working at, no one bothers you, which is the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job is that a lot of hospital staff are stressed out with bad attitudes and treat you like they are superior to you. good support from management and co-workers."

good,"Very good place to work, treat employees with respect and consideration of their .directives were sometimes challenging."
good,"Empresa Considerável, tem ótimas pessoas e bom ambiente de trabalho"
good,Every day is different bringing on new challenges. Working with hospitals can be challenging but rewarding. Many hospitals in the Chicago area are large amounts with high demand customers.
good,Decent enough place to work. They could always provide a higher pay rate for the amount or stress/workload. Management quality varies and unfortunately changes often but most people stay within the company.
good,"Good place to work, no career advancement.  Very dynamic work enviorment.  Lots of hours required to get a job done.  Management heavily over worked hard for work home balance"

good,"Derivado a ter que estar de prevenção 24 horas por dia, 6 dias por semana, o rendimento é muito baixo pois o salário mínimo apenas é complementado por uma isenção de horário no valor de 100 € mais 30 € por cada domingo de trabalho (apenas pago se houver algum serviço)."
good,"Good work life balance with the ability to work from home. Well compensated for the role that is asked of you, however while it may seem uncapped there is definitely a ceiling for a sales role. Friendly and very helpful management. Ability to move up is very limited."

good,"I work with incoming calls. Customer services all time and that time matters in most cases. Need to have initiative to understand that all calls are important but need to be catergorize  if it's emergency,urgent, or regular message. Also doing follow ups on emergency case.  My co-workers are very friendly very comfortable environment. Is very important to send the message to the primary person on the account and follow instructions if its to secondary person or an on call person. Is a constant changing instruction for different accounts. I enjoy the job I consider it a very simple job and comfortable."
good,"Stericycle is a great company for individuals who are self-starters and willing to travel. Every day is different and there is no shortage of career opportunities. The team I worked with is strong, supportive, and fun. I will miss the people I work with and I'm leaving to be closer to family. Work-life balance is difficult to maintain due to the predominant work-from-home business model. It takes a strong individual to be successful. I found my time here to be very beneficial both personally and professionally."
good,"Stericycle is a great place to work."
good,Lots of labor work most of pretty busy. I learned how to work as a team. The hardest part of job would be dumping those heavy garbage bins inside the garbage bins. I liked driving around in the tractor and backing them up in the docks.
good,"A typical day at work with steicycle with the position that I held was never typical. I learned a lot working with Stericycle. I was the lead tech, for out district, in which we serviced 40+ hospitals, We were in charge of collecting all sharps containers throughout the hospital, and having them transported to a facility to properly disposed of. I help write all the SOPs  directions such as how to build carts with empty containers, to go to all areas of the hospital step by step instructions so that in need any tech could come to that hospital and service it. My job was to fill in for anyone  on vacation, off on sick leave, to start new hospitals, go in and install all new cabinets, outline the area for best possible service, Management was always in contact for many different reasons but really enjoyed working for my immediate supervisor, the co-workers which I only seen when they needed assistance for different reasons, such as adding a new area etc. They were always glad to see me and me them. The hardest part of my job was travel, I might be in one part of the state that morning and be at the other end of the state in the same day such as if a illness occurred you had to make sure their hospital got serviced. The most enjoyable part of my job was met and dealt with so many different people and I guess that is why I consider my self a people person I have learned to deal with so many different personalities and cope very efficiently ."
good,"My job varied from either inbound or outbound. If told to do outbund calls I had a certain call quota per day to make or if doing inbound and taking calls I had a certain amount of work to do off the phone."

good,In defense of the company they are currently restructuring.
good,"I start my day with five carts fifty 4 gallons containers on 3 carts, and six 17 gallon containers on two carts. I roll around one cart at a time to specific locations in health facilities. One thing i've learned from this company is communication is everything in this industry. Management is pretty good. The supervisors are very understanding and overall seem to be good people. I do not have many co-workers I mainly work by myself. The hardest part about my job is i have to wait until the carts get deliverd to start working. The most enjoyable part of my job is that i get to work independent and when the job is done im done."
good,"I enjoyed the offered overtime, and the pay was not bad. Sometimes the work day could be stressful."
good,"good management,safety oriented company,and customer care"
good,This was the biggest benefit to me - working from home was much nicer than having to commute 1 hour each way - it a fun company with many monthly games and contest.  We were able to contribute to an Employee Fund from each paycheck that would help any employee in need.  When they had the flood in Houston they took trucks to the area to help our employees in need - there was a call center in Houston
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,Serviced about 10-15 large and small quantity accounts every day. Good job and stayed in good shape. Some heavy and repetitive lifting while getting in and out of a box truck. Had to pay attention to detail and plan ahead in order to keep customer fully stocked with containers. Medical clinics and hospital accounts setting so professional mannerism is essential.
good,Part-time job via internet allowing you to choose or decline potential assignments.  Minimal supervision/pressure.  Good for retirees in some sort of physical condition.  Requires vehicle which is reimbursed at nominal rate.
good,Everyone at the Rancho Cordova branch knew each other and looked out for one another.  This place is a good fit for people that like a lot of work that's consistent and repetitive.
good,Was definitely an experience working here. I did like the people I worked with but I didn't necessarily enjoy the environment as to the nature of the work (medical waste).
good,"The smell was bad on hot days and the weight of the containers coming off the trucks was a bit too much, they were not arranged to have help from a forklift or even a pallet jack."
good,"Amazing to work with such great people which makes it so enjoyable to call it my 2nd family. "
good,"Day to day work consist of reviewing emails, building routes, maintaining standards for all routes that are built on a daily, weekly, bi-weekly and monthly basis. Fun environment at local branch. Customer First is the culture"
good,"I like working here. I feel they neede more help in supervising and managing, because it could be overwhelming with the amount of in call center workers and remote workers. When I worked evenings I knew what my job was. However when you work days its a totally different way of doing things which will never be explained (when and if you have to do a change schedule) you sort of have to catch on or ask a coworker if ones available to help so you wont get in trouble for giving out wrong info. As I left company was going to close call center and go remote. It was a high turn over rate. For some people the littlest thing could get you fired. Others ehhh. All in all team meetings were great while they lasted. I also loved the culture team and the variety of calls that were received."
good,"Productive and a very nice place to work. Departments was fun and very educational. good benefits on medical, dental and vision. pay was very outstanding."
good,"Coworkers make the workplace livable, but not how the management handles and divides workload among employees. Occasional overtime specially approaching month end is expected."
good,"I worked in the warehouse. Had to be able to lift heavy weight and climb in and out of trailers. Also had to be okay with working with hazardous material. After a few weeks new hires were able to take a company exam to start driving the forklift. Once you are able to drive the forklift the job became easier. "
good,"Good place to work, had 4 direct reports.  Managed tier 1 helpdesk and tier 2 desktop analyst.  Meetings, good work environment.  Work environment was good until new management and reorganization.  Went downhill from there.  Nothing was hard about job, most enjoyable part is working with a great team and getting things done with no drama."
good,Good overall workplace.  Usually accommodating.  Steady paced God management.  But it only takes one bad erg to spoil a good thing...  if everyone can't work well together it makes for a difficult day for all.
good,"Respected company with a good mission.  This was an internship that could have led into a full-time job.  I was not enthusiastic with ""medical waste management"" and the culture in my early 20's.  In retrospect, it would have been a good corporate job, with a nice culture."
good,Stericycle has a great sales division and many layers of management to support sales and organizational growth goals.  Stericycle specializes in RMW sales.
good,I was only there for a year I find they lack in training and in communication of changes that are happening or have already happened. Policy and procedures are not applicable
good,"Evenly paced environment, I had a good amount of work to do in an acceptable amount of time to finish the work. I was on the phone some with clients. I enjoyed my work there though it was temporary."
good,"Nice place to work as they let you just get in, get on and get it done. The autonomy to decide is great and as long as the word is being done, there are few concerns. Very recommended."
good,"Great pay, great company to be a part of. Stericycle create hostile environment for employees and customers by not following policy. Management was one the best I ever had, but was bias and dysfunctional ."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,I did enjoy working at the call center. They offered a lot of incentive rewards. And for the hire ons they offered benefits and paid vaction and sick pay. Very relaxed atmosphere
good,Supervisor at work and trained new employees when we had new classes to help get things started.  I would do spreadsheets and reports for all employees and their statistics for flow of work.  Send/receive new product for our employees to process.
good,"Love the company, their core values and vision. Great benefits, but it does not pay well or recognize individual talents."
good,The manager was to busy and didn't seem to care face to face about employees. The hardest part of job was not getting distracted in order to keep focused with whats going on with the work everyday assigned.
good,"Great employees to work with, Learned a lot about the Hazardous waste industry. To much travel. Average week for me would be to leave on a Sunday afternoon and return home on a Friday afternoon"
good,Great company locations all over the country. Excellent if you want train in different accepts of the company. Benefits are good. Not much mobility in Kansas city area
good,It was a good job but I didn't feel management was fair to me. They told me about customers complaining about my work without telling me which customer it was.
good,Good work environment and i miss my coworker. Very high work volume but was maintainable because of the fun work environment.
good,"A typical day starts with a commute to all local hospitals. I would take inventory of all supplies, review documents and perform prescribed collections and shipping. The job was very rewarding in that I got a chance to interact with a medical staff of all levels. This job required a lot of self motivation. The best part was the autonomy it provided and allowed me to attend college."
good,"Empres en proceso de estandarizacion a nivel nacional en todas sus sucursales a lo largo de todo el pais. En general es una empresa solida, con vasta experiencia en el manejo de los residuos, falta reforzar el area de facturacion y cobranza, ademas del area comercial."
good,"Casual, Friendly atmosphere."
good,This is a company that is growing and is always on the lookout to purchase more company. Room to move up is there for those that work hard and can be noticed.  This is a corporate setting.
good,Really had fun working there. Had some fun times with the guys.The guys would help out on our routes when needed so like all my jobs I liked them all.
good,"Knowing daily what your are doing , little to no supervision , able to listen to music while working the hardest part to me is finding  something to do when out of work ,"
good,"Stericycle is a great company to work for. They care very much about protecting people's health and safegaurding the environment. We provide many services for hospitals, healthcare, and pharmaceutical companies in disposing hazardous waste, diseases, and syringe needles. Most people do not know how important of a huge role we play in protecting our community. Stericycle helps protects clients so those people can do the same in protecting theirs..."
good,"This was a good company to work for and to get involved with the hazardous waste business. The job is always changing, but good culture."
good,Work is somewhat mundane howeverit is rewarding both personally as well as proffesionally. Overall a great place to work
good,Processing defective medicine into a database. I learn about new medicines each day. The management does their best in trying to accommodate you. I enjoy working with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is the monotonous of work. The most enjoyable is the interactions with co-workers and supervisors
good,"Waste company, made me aware of different products on recall"
good,Great company to work for - advancement opportunities the only downside is mid level mgrs / supervisors are looked to perform two full time job duties
good,"nice people, learn about a lot of recalled items, the management was not good, co-workers were nice. The hardest part of the job was making your numbers by the end of the day, there's only so much work. Most enjoyable part was you could listen to your music will working."
good,Typical day at work would consist of boxing waste to be shipped.
good,Learned how to work effectively in an office environment. Management was excellent.
good,"A typical day on my 8-5 shift at Stericycle involved me assisting in ""Shipping and Receiving"" and analyzing information for input of customers product, and maintaining accurate records of all data entered into the computer. I was responsible for sorting, counting, weighing and scanning all returned products, as well as reading necessary documentation to determine types and quantities of material to be measured, counted, sorted, and weighed. During my short period at Stericycle, I was also responsible for maintaining all operational and regulatory procedures, and adhere to all OSHA Safety Regulations, as well as perform other duties as requested."
good,"At this employment, it is a busy and steady work enviroment. I learned the value of having a co workers who work together to produce productivity. The hardest part of the job is the tempature in the summer because massive autoclaves are burning repeatedly. What I like most about the job is the crew we had because we understood each other and worked well together."
good,I liked that I was outside a lot and going all over OKC and getting to know other people.
good,Loved the job but the company made greedy decisions to where they were unable to pay commission manyvsales people had been used too. So people left the company
good,I am typically very busy throughout my day.  My morning starts pretty much independently as I work with very little supervision.  Afternoons get busy with drivers returning from route and many questions to be answered and route changes to be made.  I have learned many new skills here.  I enjoy my working relationships and find it refreshing.
good,"Fast pace with little room to grow within the company.  Company was making a lot of new changes before I left.  Hopefully for the better. Got to be able to meet a lot of new people everyday.  Again, great place to work."
good,Long hours there is no teamwork. i Learn how to work fast and quick on each station. The hardest part of work it was standing up for long hours and my only enjoy was sometimes my paycheck and my days off...
good,"Depending on your position, hours vary. There is a supportive management staff and Human Resources spends quite a bit of time in the office. Excellent customer service skills are needed for both internal and external customers."
good,Before merge of Cintas Document Shredding with Shred-It it was a great place to work. Now it's all cut throat. Safety has gone to wayside to not interfere with profit. Heavy work load and fast paced
good,The organization is reputable and stable overall and mangement at my particular office is amicable.  Compensation structure could be more rewarding.  I like the 4 days on 3 days off to include weekends.
good,"I am a remote driver in Savannah, Ga. My team office is located in Orlando, FL. Good working with retail associates. Learn a lot working with hazardous materials. Good environment to work in."
good,"My  department was closed but they company is good as long as you work!"
good,"Working for Stericycle for over 8 years.  Tractor Trailer driver on retail and industrial divisions, no medical waste just retail and industrial waste.  Under my supervisor learn a lot about segregation and hazard classes.  Have to service some areas and segregate and pack different waste depending on hazard classes. Average 50-57 hours a week. Plenty of overtime and physical work.  Pay could be a better, but is better than a lot of other trucking jobs in area."
good,"Company encourages education and continuous improvement in order to drive a balance for work and life."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,Stericycle Waste Management was quick paced of delivering biohazard waste containers and pick up of medical waste. I drove a single axil box truck and also talked to customers about steps/process of medical waste
good,"I worked for the ""Shred It"" division of Steriycle. Not bad, I actually loved the job itself, but advancement opportunities were solely based on favoritism. I also was sexually harassed by a corporate big shot, and despite the proof, HR did not take the case on, and I was still forced to work side by side with this man. Hence why I quit."
good,"Management is very accessible and the overall culture allows for collaboration and learning. Overall, the company is undergoing many changes as it evolves, mostly bringing in qualified talent to help improve upon the current management team."
good,"It was a decent job, but unfortunately I was working through a temp agency. A full time employee in my position would have had benefits and all that good stuff, but I got the  typical temp treatment and they said I accessed the building without a card and fired me. You can't enter the building without a card, fyi."
good,While working her I have come to find that when you do your job well they give you more work until you have become over worked to the point that you continually fail and only once you fail are they doing anything about it. When they do anything about they are pointing the finger at the employee that they are the one who is wrong and messed up. Very bad management/leader training for this company. This the leads to failed employee jobs
good,Stericycle provides customer service for product recalls and notices.  Provides great opportunity for employees/contractors to learn how to best relate and serve customers who are often quite stressed with their situation.
good,"Time management, Stable, Support and resources, Flexible hours and management, ability to excel, very little management training, no resources to promote knowledge and certifications"
good,Gran empresa en el poder económico. Trabajo que demanda alto nivel de preocupación tanto para el cliente como para personal de la empresa en funciones de retiro y transporte de residuos hospitalarios
good,Good place to work except during the summer cause you were outside on the loading dock and cold during the winter but other than that great co workers and boss.
good,"I start my day by checking to see if my Team Members have the tools that they need - then checking Customer accounts."
good,Stericycle was an educational work setting with some stressful situations on a day to day basis but with the proper management team and training my co workers and I were able to successfully take care of any issues or concerns that came our way.  I learned how to deal with callers and doctors in stressful circumstances and solve each call to the best of my ability.
good,"Managers work with you to get the job done. If anything goes wrong with a job assignment, they always there to help you or take care the problem."
good,"The start of my day consist of; When a shift lead is out on vacation\sick i have to run his shift ( 1st, 2nd are 3rd for RMW side and SMS side ), which i would have to move trucks to the dock to be unloaded and processed and loaded for the next day and i have to change out the trash compactor using the yard Rolloff truck, picking the cans up and moving them to it's desigated area. Keeping my on our work schedule and maintaining my job duties. Stericycle is a great company to work for, i learned alot over the years been there for example; Operating Tractor & trailers ( from pups to 53'ers ), time management and communicating with others. The hardest part of my job is the inconsistent of climate change from hot in the summer and cold in the winter."
good,Good company. Took good care of their Long Haul Drivers even thought they eliminated the Long Haul Position. I would work for them again in a heartbeat if they bring the position back.
good,Typical days at work run smoothly. Definitely learned alot about production and management. Co workers were one of the best aspects of the job. Working 12 hour night shifts were one of the hardest aspects.
good,I like how its close to my house and the hour lunch. My manager is great but the place is very fast paced and high turnover rate.
good,Got to be there at 5 am in the morning but you get one day off during the week and weekends off. Just the pay is low for a CDL driver but good health benefits
good,"To be honest it's a great company for the most part, but there was alot of miscommunication between them and the Temp Service I was working there through. Things that the company wanted you to do the temp service didn't approve of so it was too much for us as employees. But most people were really friendly and helpful so it made it easy to want to come to work!"
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,I learned good communication skills and how to work within a team oriented base and authentic safety guidelines on how to handle rmw waste and handled sharp containers and rx within hospital confines
good,Great place to work...management changes rules whenever they feel like it ...attendance policy was ok as long as you could make up your hours you missed & you get a hour lunch!!
good,"Productive and friendly  workplace ,great supervisors . I also enjoy interacting with the customers the routes are planed out in a convenient way to get the job done in a fast and save way."
good,"The job itself is very physical and not for everyone. However, they do a good job on placing you in the spot they think would be more beneficial to you and your work preferences. The management team is pretty good about trying to work with you even though some things cant be helped! It's a decent job with pretty good benefits and I like it for the most part!"
good,"This is a good place to work, with lots of chances to advance to other things.  They take care of any training you need, and continue to train you as you work.  Management is fairly relaxed and understanding when it comes to employees needs.  While the work can be repetitive, no day is ever the same."
good,I learned a lot with Stericycle. The work culture is wonderful and the organization of company works to assist the clients. Unfortunately they were not interested or understood how to grow the business for RN skills so a handful on RNs including myself hadnpositions eliminated.
good,"You have to be a team player and be able to work under extreme conditions. The benefits are good, but the salary is small and no room for advancement. Manager is easy to talk to and values my service."
good,I like working at Stericycle. It is a recession proof company with as many hours as you can work.  The manager care and safety is important. I would recommend and have recommended Stericycle to friends.
good,"early starts when on hgvs but normally ment you were finished early ."
good,Lots of changes after moving. Great place. The culture is great and the employees are amazing. I would refer this job to any one wanting stability. Would return to this company.
good,"- Good hours"
good,"Really enjoyable work atmosphere, even when it's busy. Every day is different, so the employee never gets bored of their work. Management is great! Hardest part of the job is manually unloading trailers. Best part of the job is the monthly BBQ's the management has for all the staff."
good,"I was a field technician at several hospitals for 7 years.  This job was good because you worked independently and as long as you completed your work, my boss was satisfied."
good,"Low paying but fine for extra cash. Low pressure, easy work. Projects are picked up when available. No room for advancement. Low availability of projects."
good,I have an amazing manager that allows me to be myself and have input on decisions that effect our Team Members. This alone is the reason I love working with him and the company.
good,"Pull bio-carts throughout hospital campus and exchange sharps containers."
good,"productive workplace, great first job. really enjoyed working there just need better pay rate being that I know have more bills. the job is very easy and the staff are nice."
good,1st shift bio needs to do more work than they do. They never finish their sheets and it falls back on 1st shift. We have to finish their work everyday before we can start on ours. We be here til 4am sometimes. Late hours everyday because they run too slow compared to what we accomplish every night.
good,"Great place to work because of the people, which includes the leadership team. While they could use some improvement on communication, they have their intentions in the right place."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.

good,Amazing Coworkers. The people who work for the company keep working here and enjoyable environment. I couldn't get through the day to day without them.
good,"It's great palce to work, specially if you are a student flexible hours, good pay, amazing staff."
good,Stericycle has been making vast improvements to their workplace culture.  Over the last year I have seen many advancements happening in the office and I only see it getting better with time.
good,It is a great fast paced place to work. The only drawback is that compensation is a lot less when compared to other companies.
good,"An ok place to work with big changes taking place due to a merger. "
good,"Stericycle provides a vital and necessary service to the healthcare industry. As a Healthcare Compliance Specialist, I traveled to regional and beyond hospitals training staff and providing consultation on the complex regulations for regulated waste streams. My background in hospital laboratories and safety made this a good fit for me.  I learned plenty about EPA, RCRA, OSHA, and DOT regulations in this role. My coworkers were outstanding and we had a great time while meeting our customers needs. Traveling was a new experience for me, but my manager helped me learn the tricks of the trade. I was sad to leave the company, but that's corporate America. Downsizing happens and I'm certainly not the first and will not be the last to be part of a consolidation. I wish the company and my former colleagues all the best."
good,It is a great starter job to learn some new skills and obtain a little culture. Good people to work with and they throw free lunches quite frequently. Great Benefits!
good,"Assisting patients with after hours issues. I have an opportunity to make a day in spite of, my limitations. I try to remember that could be me walking in the shoes of someone whom needs empathy, AND professionalism. "
good,"I've worked with Stericycle for three years and they been good to me I'm  just sad we had to go our separate ways. I enjoyed the hard work, the fast pace, and all the new things I've learned. Even though it was handling waste it was something I didn't mind going to work for because there are worse things out there."
good,"•	Work with all areas in the facility to ensure safe working conditions and interact with team members and management to continually reinforce safe work practices, pointing out both the issues and encouraging positive behavior. Promote good safety culture. "
good,My job as a call center agent can be demanding at times but as well as the bad it has its good points.  We have what's called a Steri Fun team which is a committee of individuals who get together and plan fun functions for the work place.  I find it fun just planning things out and getting them done usually in a week.  Dressing up or celebrating certain holidays shows other people you care.  We have contests all the time for the best teams.  It is fun demonstrating team work and helping others achieve the best they can be.
good,Excellent benefits provided with good chance of advancement if you exhibit your skills.
good,"Stericycle is all about ""One team One Goal""! We take full responsibility of our actions and messages at the job. It can be a fun work environment at times. The people that call in can be very pleasant. on the other hand they can be very rude! We do what we are taught and show the how great customer service skills we have! As far as co-workers go, we see each other just as much as we see our home family. This is part of the reason why we feel as if we all are a big family! I enjoy most when a patient or a doctor or client is very please and satisfied with my call demeanor. The feeling you get when you feel appreciated for what you do!"
good,"I use to start work at about 4:30pm got a break like 8:00pm go back to work 8:30pm work until 12:00am until 12:15am back to work until 2:00am. I learned how to operate so a lot of equipment. Management was not fair. Co workers was older, but we was was hard workers. Hardest part of the job was staying on pace with the heavy duties and problems we ran into. The picnics was great."
good,"Incentive plan was great, management had no clue what was going on nor did they have any experience or knowledge pertaining to anything with the business. Great place to make money if you are self sufficient and a quick learner."
good,"During my time with Stericycle, I had many areas of opportunity to grow. I received support from both my Ops Team and direct reports. I did have a bit of an opportunity in that upper management did not communicate with their employees appropriately, which trickles down. Additionally, their Monarch transformation seemed ridiculous and there were layoffs. The site director is a very friendly and kind person."
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,Management is friendly and will work with you. They try to reward the workers with special events for the people. They try to hire within the company.
good,"Strong team makes for strong supervisors. First rate trucks and a strong safety record here in Dacono."
good,"Great place to work,   enjoyed management, ability to move up withing the company. Customer service recognition, pot lucks were great as well monthly."
good,"Protecting people, reducing risk."
good,It was a good company to work for until they change management other than that just keep busy doing my job making sure everything goes well as lead driver covering many routes on vacation and helping out with customer service
good,The company is a good place to work but I feel there are a lot of changes that affect the amount of work to be done on a daily basis. I feel the company has more management that looks at workflow on paper and does not take the logistics of it into consideration
good,The work we had was divided between answering problems for users and developing  fixes for known problems. This kept everyone very busy. There were no more meetings than necessary to communicate current and future goal.
good,It was a pleasure working at Stericycle. Your hard work is recognized often. Everyone has the possibility to advance whenever they take advantage of their opportunities.
good,"Stericycle offers a variety of positions: CDL truck drivers, fork lift operators, hazardous waste handling and treatment, tank farm operations, chemistry lab, sales, customer account managers, transportation logistics, plant operations management, and more.  It is a hazardous waste company with a national footprint, locations in every state.  Good company to work for, pretty good overall management team and a competent and hard-working crew.  However, the Tacoma WA facility has had problems retaining managers for more than a few months at a time, which makes it a little more stressful  than it ought to be for the crew in that plant.  Pay rate for most employees who work as environmental technicians is just under $20/hour which seems fair for this industry (drivers and certain other positions make more) but in the Seattle/Tacoma area if you are single and trying to live on one income you may find it is not quite enough to live on because the cost of living in the area is so high.  My rent was raised three times, but I never saw a comparable pay raise."
good,"Throughout my career with Stericycle, I received training and coaching that helped mentor me into a growing career path in the management field. Employees are recognized by good management for their excellent performance."
good,"a typical day would be receving a high volume of calls. from varies companies in their recalls.discarding varies products. like medication,appliances,food,automobiles, rv's, etc.  we help them with labels, packaging, and sipping areas. making sure it is discarded properly."
good,"   With respect to my experiences in Mental Health and Case Management, I have done one to one and group counseling.  I have worked with the following types of patients, Bipolar, Alzheimer, Adolescents, Addictions, Obsessive/Compulsive, Borderline and acutely psychotic.  I have done intensive housing case management with CHA residents and the chronically homeless.  I can do the clinical and clerical aspects of intakes, admissions and discharges.  I am certified in Crisis Prevention Intervention and Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation. I would greatly appreciate an opportunity to interview with your Organization and /or Program. "
good,On a typical day Stericycle was a great place to work and the benefits were awesome. Training was extensive and I would go back there if there was an opportunity to.
good,"I dont have too many complaints about the company. One would be the inconsistent scheduling. Busy times we were short; slow times, we were over scheduled"
good,Stericycle has plenty of room for one to feel relaxed and comfortable. They also have space outside to eat during the summer and for one to take a walk around the premises. they also have food trucks and other food services if one didn't take lunch.
good,"My typical work day is intended to be fairly structured but, given it's an operations role, I always have to be flexible.  People stop by my office and I'll walk onto the call center floor multiple times per day.  Sometimes I do this to have a casual conversation or to ask people for their insights if I've heard of an issue.  "
good,This company was great in the beginning but with recent changes I am concerned about job security.  We are a close family who support eachother and truly cares about one another. The management out of my particular location are supportive of their team and are always willing to work with your situation.
good,I work Monday through Friday 8am to 4:30pm for the Recall automotive reaq department. I handle 80 cases per month and it can be stressful and overwhelming at times however it feels great when you help a customer all the way through the end of the process and they are very thankful that you were able to assist them with great outcomes.
good,Overall I enjoyed my time at stericycle. I always had room to improve and be promoted. Like every company they have their issues. If I had not moved I would still be working there.
good,Everyone at Stericycle were really friendly and helpful. If you had any customers giving you a hard time the managers will guide you and find the best solution to their problems.
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.
good,Stericycle was a good company to work for.  I have nothing at all negative to say because I always try to focus on the positive at all times. This part of the survey feels a little forceful and people should be able to say a much or as little as they please.
good,"It is a fast paced job, working with the best customer service representatives. The management staff is caring and personal. The job is demanding but rewarding. I enjoyed helping people with decisions that can be difficult."
good,"The days at sherd - it were good but this job was not right for me. Every day you spend imputing number and answering phone calls."
good,"it was cool. it was nice. it was fun. it was energetic. it was calm, fast paced, nice people, nice manager. good hours good breaks good pay.. i recommend it."
good,Great training before putting you to work. Good atmosphere with awesome leads The only thing to be advice is that when its snows hard be prepared to show up to work
good,"Great place to work, you don't get micromanaged. They provide a variety of online training. Fun in the workplace atmosphere. Growing company with lots opportunity to move up."
good,Stericyce is a work together type of place .workes will help you finish what you need to so to get done  .The job can be physically demanding .But it makes the time go fast.  The job consists of recycaling  bio hazerd containers from hospitals and clinics .By washins assemble them pack them for shipping good
good,Never support from superiors I always had to figure things out on my own and communication needs work. Good learning experience and decent training however. Loved my boss just didn't like my posting. Higher management needs a lot of work. Benefits were free!
good,"I worked on the Shred-It side of the company, please note it is very different than what is going on at Stericycle proper. "
good,"good place to work.  good work life balance, quick paced, and fast changing. sales force use is a must and understanding of how you use your time will dictate how you do"
good,Company is very face paced and required a lot of time management skills. Workload was quite large but the company gave every tool needed to do it. The culture was great.
good,Great company to work for very challenging and rewarding great people great team workers really a nice experience also changed my perspective of things pertaing to life
good,A typical day included processing pharmaceutical products from companies for proper disposal.  I worked with the DEA when they would come in for their monthly inspections.
good,Don't recommend working in the wharehouse...I did for one year b4 bio systems was takin over bye stericycle they taught me to drive the trucks and even let me use a truck for the road test to get my cdl b...driving for stericycle was fun and rewarding
good,"Diretoria alinhada com a visão a longo prazo da organização. Cultura organizacional que aposta no desenvolvimento dos colaboradores, tanto da camada estratégica quanto à operacional. Ambiente de trabalho voltado à integração dos funcionários. Acesso à grandes empresas parceiras e que fazem parte da carteira de clientes. Equipe de profissionais capacitados para desempenhar suas funções. A liberdade dada aos profissionais em opinar e sugerir mudanças é um diferencial do modelo de Gestão dessa organização."
good,I think it's a great place. The company is growing and relocating to North Richland Hills. The workplace culture involves making sure we provide the best call service.
good,Productive and competitive place to work. Lots of opportunity for advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work remotely. Management was completely supportive in our day-to-day responsibilities.

good,Productive and flexible workplace promoting diversity. Stericycle is a safe environment. An agent at Stericycle must have the ability to multitask successfully. Leadership is sell coordinated.
good,"So, basically my job is answering for different services mainly in the health field while either their out for lunch or closed. I really enjoy answering different calls because you get a chance to interact with the individual calling and possibly help them. If I don't understand how to deliver a certain call there are TL's available to assist. The supervisors are awesome they do different events to show there appreciation for their employees for our dedication and hard work. The job is pretty easy as long as you have the proper training that you need to have in order to know how to reach the physician. With in my 6 months I literally know how to do everything including dispatching. Also a plus is after leveling up and being in good standards you get to work from home and guess what I'm working from home."
good,Family orientated company.  Very nice benefits in a variety.  Nice stock options as well.  Sometimes too many micro management.  Too many managers all employees who think they are managers.
good,"GOOD company to work.  Good benefits.  Was busy and heavy a typical day at work. About supervisor, the communication was by phone most the time.  That was a good part you never see a supervisor or manager."
good,The job is easy the hardest part of the job is huntingloading and unloading tankers. No matter where you work management is going to be management pretty much good along with everybody if you looking for a career that would be the best place to go
good,"Working from home as a Customer Service Rep on the late night shift can be a challenge. Working as a Massage Therapist is a true passion of mine and I enjoy being able to help rid any pain or discomfort through massage.

good,"Stericycle is a great company to work for, they have many different departments within the company. The work keeps you busy but it's not overwhelming."

good,"I enjoyed working at Stericycle because they were very organized and attentive to our needs. We had lots of pitch-ins and management made us feel important, took the job real serious and when we needed to improve on something for example call duration, call percentages, etc... Our managers were there to help us improve on what we needed."

good,"Stericycle is a stable and dynamic company, The company genuinely tries to do well by their employees. Unfortunately. It sometimes seems Stericycle is top heavy and out of touch with the basic team member. Human Resources governs an excessive amount of control over Managers and make proper and appropriate discipline by managers cumbersome and frustrating,"
good,Good place to work and friendly environment. Can learn many new tasks every day. People help you in learning new technologies and help you grow in your career.

good,A regular day is walking and service every bio hazard sharps container throughout the hospital. Stericyle gave me a chance to better develop my self management and social skills. the company also  gave me a since of job security because the more you know how to do the more the company value your services. My manager was very firm but understanding to the employee's lives and situations. The most difficult thing about the  job was trying to accommodate customers on situations that are last minute.

good,Stericycle is a great place to work. Baltimore management however leaves something to be reckoned with. I gave 7 & a half years of exemplary service with an equal amount of years receiving the highest annual evaluations then was defrauded out of six months of travel expenses. I complained to corporate & it was founded that was indeed the case & I was subsequently paid arrearages at that time we had to part ways.

good,I worked with their Director's Choice campaign and absolutely loved it. Co-workers and management were great. 75% of the Directors were horrible. When you would work overnights you usually ended up walking them up sk they were cranky.
good,Very fun place to work at but it sucks sitting down all the time. Lunches are very short as well. Easy work for good pay. They have a lot of benefits but a lot of rules. Vacation hours suck.

good,A typical day at work may be going in expecting to make outbound calls and within minutes you could be switched to taking inbound calls.  Sometimes the calls come in back to back so you have to have all your windows open and ready to multi task.  You have to be fast on a keyboard just to keep up as well. Although this job was too far from where i live they had a dress code that was very lenient.  The only times we couldnt wear jeans on the job was when clients came for a visit.  Other than clients coming we could wear jeans.  The hardest part of the job was the distance.  The job was just too far for me to travel.
good,"A normal day at work was getting all office areas clean and spotless. I learned how to clean around computers and office equitment without harming or disturbing. It was good to have a supervisor that understood our needs and made our jobs much easier. All my co-workers were easy to work with.

good,"Stericycle is just this, a good company with good people behind it. It's very entrepreneurial in that it is a younger company that is quickly growing. That being said, there is a lot of room to expand in your own role and be cross functional with other teams. See something you can improve? then come up with an idea of how to fix it and you'll likely be given the chance to do so. Very different than a large established and very structured company. You also get is feeling that people believe in what they do and what they sell."

I learned how to work with management to solve problems and to depend on my own judgement. The people I worked with were hard working and always ready to complete a challenge. Some days it was hard to complete an assignment before the next one was given to you! Our management was always there to lend a helping hand when needed. We had a great bunch of people to work with and I did enjoy going to work every day."

Every was very kind from the supervisor to the co-workers and my team leader who was training me and teaching what to do. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with difficult clients that can lead you to be stressed, but trying to be calm and patient with them by telling them what you can do to help them and not what you can't do. The most enjoyable part of the job is being an agent and being able to learn about the computer program used to help clients and reach out to them."

good,"Stericycle is a vast medical waste company with many facets to fill for just about any job skill, so long as you work hard. For hard workers with a 'go get em' attitude and looking to start a career, or simply stay with one company for a long time, it is easy to gain advancement, though that may include relocation. Stericycle treats its employees well, from the lowest up. Many of the entry level positions act as the face of the company, getting most of the interactions with the company's customers, and so requires a lot of independence and responsibility from their employees and rewards them in kind for their excellent service."

good,I was actually the lawn care and landscaper for Stericycle. The manager was demanding but very kind. Had high goals for what he wanted his facility to look like. I had no co-workers as i worked alone. The hardest part of the job was probably consistently having to re-do what was already done once a week before.

good,"Stericycle was one of the best companies I've worked for. A typical day at work was taking calls for customers who had a question about their invoice or billing. My role was to explain invoices, make proper adjustments and report mistakes to my supervisor. We used multiple systems simultaneously to look up customer accounts and notate them. I learned how to problem solve even faster with this position and multitask more. Many times I could close another account or email a customer while helping another customer on the phone. The workplace culture was great. We did many team building activities including a trip to Dave and Busters. The hardest part was the customers. Some would call and start off cussing and yelling but none were to difficult to calm down and help. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to get up, take a short walk and get back to work. Having that ability made work great. I never got too overwhelmed."

good,Fast working surrondings; relaxed at times but with so many moving components it was putting out one fire after another; good implementation of PM system made great improvements. I was exposed to PLC's systems which greatly increased my transferable skills. My team members were very freindly and willing to help out whenever equipment broke down. The hardest part of the job was the calls I used to get after putting long hours of work going home and having to return to work from my drive way (45 miles away) to attend to problems that were PLC related. What I enjoyed the most of my work was actually doing what I was hired for. The complexity of the problem at hand made the challenge more gratifying. I enjoy my work very much -no regrets.

The workplace culture is very diverse ranging from real authentic African Americans, French speaking agents, Hispanic and Latina agents, as well as Caucasian and Asian. The hardest part of the job is being able to perform great customer service even when the customer is speaking horrible to you. The most enjoyable part of the job is that the supervisors and managers are so laid back and cool, but also are a ""Get The Job Done"" quality team."
