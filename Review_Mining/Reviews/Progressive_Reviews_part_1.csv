bad,"i was actually told that i could not have time off for my mother's funeral because-and i quote-""she did not die while i was employed""."
bad,"It took 6 months to get hired on. The job description I was given was not at all what I was actually doing. The training was a joke. My boss routinely broke dress code, and was way too touchy feely. The $hitbox Ford they gave me to work out of had a CO leak and almost killed me on a long drive. My co workers poured most of their work on me. What a terrible company to work for."
bad,met a lot of wonderful people at Progressive. You will have lifetime friends from working at Progressive and I'm going to miss my co workers and will keep in touch
bad,"I will not go too far into detail. But I will say while working at progressive, my anxiety became so bad that I could not function normally on a daily basis. I eventually had to seek help with a psychologist and ended up on FMLA, not able to work. But my FMLA was stopped abruptly and I was fired when I had to change doctor's, and couldn't get a new appointment by progressives deadline. They definitely care more about how their employees sound on the phones than care about how they treat their employees. It's very sad and I will never work in customer service again because of my experience at progressive. Their employees are nothing but another number making the company money."
bad,"Horrible work equipment faculty software. Care more about saving money then doing what is right, distrustful, dishonest crooks, the only company I know that is comfortable ruining their employees life with a smile on their face"
bad,"They will not tell you what they hire you for.  You will think a Cobol Developer.  Wrong.  They will put you on what they call ""Bypasses"".  Fixing bad claims data that was spitted out during the nightly cycle.   The way of fixing these changes from day to day.  You are doomed before you start.  They told me that no one has lasted very long on theses.  They not lying.  You will have a female who is autistic looking over your shoulder and she will become angry quickly and then be friendly.  Then she will tattle to her female manager.  The female manager will eat up what she is being told.  Then female manager will micro manage you to see what you really know.  Then you will be let go.  This is ""Children of the Corn"" type stuff.  You have been warned."
bad,"I was so excited about working at Progressive in general when l first started but quickly reality sunk in. The training was extensive and draining because they just feed you with loads of information and expect you to get it overnight. But, then supervisors claim they know it’s a lot of work I felt that the supervisor was too busy being bias with unprofessional new hires. However, the culture is diverse but there are a few that clearly show what side they're on by their actions especially in management. There’s always job advancements but only if the supervisors like you will they recommend a promotion. It’s always a plus to know people in high places. Some of the attitudes with the supervisors when you request help it was so uncomfortable, unprofessional and fake it made me hate going to work and this company will have you fooled so please don't stand up for yourself if there are any disputes because they will stick with their kind and never forget it. A lot of racial profiling with certain supervisors they definitely will sabotage you if they don’t like you because my request could’ve been answered but the supervisor put in a bad word on me and that’s one of the major reasons I quit... This particular location is very toxic supervisors know you’re struggling but then tell others not to help you and stick you with tons of claims..."
bad,"Disappointed beyond belief. I watched people in my training class start dwindling while still in class. The reason they have such huge turn over is not because of attendance as they state. It is because the job description is a lie in itself. Customer service is told in class they are responsible to make whatever offers that populate on the screen. As long as you make the offer you're good to go. Once you hit the floor however it becomes your responsibility to not only make every single offer they have pop up (even where the offer is clearly not appropriate) but also ""get takes"". That makes you responsible for sales while having zero control over said sales. You may talk them in to talking to a sales professional but you're not licensed for sales. You can break your back in this place and still be written up as well as termed for not making sales, that again you do not have control over. If I call my car insurance provider to let's say extend my billing date as many do because whatever came up and I won't have funds until the following week, do I want my provider trying to cram other products down my throat? No, absolutely not. I have seen this place tear down many good people. People I thought would stay.. all gone. There are two people left from the training class I was in and I am not one of them. My sanity is worth far more to me than high stress and unrelenting environment that progressive is. Nor do they pay the people who do return every day, that perform beautifully every day ( and they may have had 25 takes that week, not even within a mile close to what they deserve"
bad,"Every time I apply for a position I know for a fact I am qualified for the recruiter says we decided to move with other candidates. I am applying for positions where I know for the last 5 years worked in that area. Not understanding. Feels like I am being black balled. Just may be a blessing because everyone I speak with dislikes the location of Highland and Mayfield Heights, OH very unhappy people. The pick and choose who they want in versa giving people who have experience in field a chance or the job has been given to another. They openly disqualify you even in a in person interview. Telling security guard she a no go/no shook the interviewer at progressive shook head like no. Don't recommend company. Too many people looking for a career and they have a lot of open positions for a reason"
bad,"long and over work. The turn around was very disappointing "
bad,"Progressive treats their employees like children. They completely micromanage and threaten your job with your numbers and compare the younger employees with the older employees.  If you are accidentally one minute late and don’t make it up, you’re warned.  People walk down the hall with miserable looks on their faces and don’t acknowledge each other.  The manager cliques are horrible and treat their employees as “beneath” them.   Run!"
bad,"There needs to be a serious investigation done on the hiring practices at this company specifically in the South Florida region. Candidates that posses extensive experience and knowledge in the Insurance field are being overlooked. For Example, one of my colleagues applied to this company several times in the past year for different positions and was never offered an interview,  just a reject email. Well maybe it was a good thing since he works for us now the competitor. It seems like the recruiter or robots do not throughly review applications so that a well equipped individual can tackle the massive caseloads  Now I see why they're always hiring, they can't keep quality people in SFL region. Consider yourself bless if you don't get the job."
bad,You go to work and they put all sorts of demands that sometimes will make sense and most of the time won't. To be honest they don't care about the person as long as you meet the dollars they want you to make period
bad,"- Bad ethics"
bad,Δεν μου αρεσε καθολου σαν εργασιακο περιβαλλον διοτι μας ειχαν υποσχεθει την και καλα επιτυχια αλλα δεν υπηρξε προοδος γενικοτερα στην ζωη μου και καθημερινη ανελιξη στην εργασια μου διοτι υπηρχαν κλικες που κανανε και ουσιαστικα ηταν σαν να μη με θελανε.Αναγκαστηκα στις 6/6/2019 να παραιτηθω απο την εταιρια για λογους ευθυξιας επειτα απο καβγα με την Sector Leader του Project που εργαζομουνα καθως επισης και με τον εκπαιδευτη μου.
bad,"Let's just cut to the chase here : Bad, lazy or downright incompetent adjusters routinely get promoted (because they're buddy buddy with the management). Good, hardworking adjusters are consistently passed over for promotions and eventually leave the company for greener pastures. I have personally seen people hopelessly behind in their work with no chance in heck of ever catching up be promoted to supervisor. I've seen people who barely understand their current position and do poor work be promoted over someone who is consistently on top of their game. Your work product doesn't matter here. If you're liked, you're protected and will shoot up the ladder. If you're not a part of the ""in"" group, forget it. You will be in the same position 20 years down the line, and they'll give you every excuse under the sun as to why you haven't gone anywhere."
bad,"Worked for progressive through a third party company TTEC... TTEC is unorganized and does not care about its employees. "
bad,"This corporation's culture is vile.  They hire you right out of college, pay less than competitors and then fire their employees when their salary range moves higher.  There is corruption from the top all the way down.  You will never be caught up.  There are no perks for employees and all you will ever hear is what you did not do right.  A horrible company and I am so glad I am out of there.   Would not recommend this company to my worst enemy.  Micromanagement at its best."
bad,The Metrics are horrible wanting you to sell bundle items to customers who aren’t interested . Now you are being coached on how to sell products without commission. Work hours awful . Attendance policy awful . Management horrible. No room for advancement.
bad,Gave 12 years to the company and they closed my office.  Was not offered to move to different location just discarded like a dirty towel. Sad to treat loyal employee's this way.
bad,This is a place where you are worked like a horse and the expectation are unrealistic. Lack of career advancement and poor work culture. Caseload is unbearable and customers and management dont make it easy. Everyday is a fight and it is not worth the stress.
bad,"This company sucks I would never work there again.  If you like being tied to a desk, clocking in and out for the bathroom...this is the job for you.."
bad,"Where do I start? Managers are disrespectedful and will talk to you like a child. You don't recieve adequate support or training. Recruiters will lie and tell you there is work from home options and that you are rewarded based off performance. Progressive is not performance based it's all based off who likes you, favoritism and discrimination.You recieve unorganized, unstructured training. You have to deal with verbal abuse from customers,coaches, supervisors and directors. You handle between 80-90 calls in 1 day that leave you mentally and physically exhausted. No time for huddles with your team or people around you since you are chained to your phone. Performance is never enough nor rewarded. They will sabotage the great performers and prevent you from growth within the company. The worst experience ever to say the least. Very high turnover. If you enjoy being told no to career progression and oppurtunity as well as being lied to discriminated on and sabotaged you will fit right in with the Progressive culture."
bad,factory worker - they do not value you - interview process is long - great starting pay but to move up they make you jump through hoops - very high stress job not worth it
bad,"Progressive has the most selfish and awful management team, all the way up to the top.  I would very highly caution anyone who wanted to work there, or even do business with them."
bad,"This is a terrible place to work, I would not recommend that anyone work here where they treat you like a slave and force you to take 100 plus inbound calls per day."
bad,"Work load is EXTREME and Completely Unreasonable. The claims department is designed for failure. You will never catch up on work or you will NEVER get ahead. Management SUCKS. Progressive will work you until you BREAK and then just replace you with the next sucker. You will most definitely be suicidal after 6 months. Terrible Terrible Terrible , God awful experience"
bad,"We were lied to from day one.  My recruiter told me that everyone one starts at the same pay, I didn't find out till later that wasn't true and that I could have negotiated my pay, when I brought this to their attention they told me too late.  They told us they don't micro manage and that were adults and will be treated as such, that was a lie.  They micro manage every second of your day, we're there for 9 hours and get 1 10 minute bathroom break (it takes half,  that time just to get to the bathroom). There is no paid sick time, you are forced to use your hard earned vacation time and even then you only earn 5 hours every 2 weeks.   The coaches are insanely worthless, all they do is repeat the same thing every session.  The managers have no clue what's going on at all, they would rather fire an employee rather than give them proper training.  They push 6 months worth of training on you in a few weeks, most of which will never be used."
bad,"Managment lies to you. Its a horrivle work enviornment. Do not complain about the enviornment or it will come back on you. Managment does not care, they will not help you. Only find ways for it to be your fault. If its not your fault, they will turn other things around against you."
bad,"Don't work here unless you are desperate.  I was hired for a particular position, but told to work in another.  When someone else at corporate was available, they laid me off and had them take over the work."
bad,"Disappointed beyond belief. I watched people in my training class start dwindling while still in class. The reason they have such huge turn over is not because of attendance as they state. It is because the job description is a lie in itself. Customer service is told in class they are responsible to make whatever offers that populate on the screen.

bad,"hated the culture of this company they require you to go through training and it's like school. the company does not value time at home at all you work every weekend, evening, and holiday possible."
bad,"Non stop calls from people that are not happy with their own situation and will take it out on you. You will be lied to from everyone, the customer, supervisor, coach, upper management, etc. No room for advancement because a very select few will be promoted to a job that does not offer answering a phone. The likelihood of this being you is 1 in 1000 because that's about how many people apply to jobs that don't involve a phone. Everyone wants to be off the phone and after about 3-4 months you'll realized the quickest way off the phone is to find another employer, therefore most of your training class will be gone by then and they'll already have had 2 or 3 more training classes coming in and more people leaving. Just look at how many training classes the have for customer service and sales, about one a month because its a revolving door, this is a BIG RED FLAG for a company. Low level people are miserable there, the only happy employees are the people that don't answer the phones, or they're still in training and haven't taken any phone calls yet. I would never go back to this place, toxic."
bad,"Progressive is solely focused on profit. The health and wellness are not a priority if the company feels they will lose dollars. As long as an employee earns the company profit, they will enjoy working for Progressive but the minute the employee is no longer profit, the company will begin working them out the door."
bad,"If you don't want to work the same schedule and make the same money indefinitely do not apply. Had to work there an entire year before I was able to get a decent schedule. Being open 24 hours a day means holidays which you are required to work at least one. The sales organization sets you up to fail before you even begin and then looks at you for why sales are bad. Harsh judgement on agents for not meeting certain quotas when customers make it almost impossible. Most of the job is scripted and you are required to ask customers loads of unnessecary questions. If you don't say exactly what your supposed to, your not doing your job, even if you get a sale. Supervisors want you to beg for a sale. To get a promotion at progressive the stars have to align. If you want to have scumbags scream at you all day this is the job for you."
bad,"Terrible place to work, everyone micromanages, they are very cheap as a company. When you first work there, you will get food leftovers mainly all the time from higher ups. I worked at employers that give everyone their own food plus you get to take any extra food to take home. Also, when 1 person did not show up for training that was in a chair by mine, I ask, can I get his cup and they told me ""No, let me take that"". This place is a joke. The perks are pretty bad. The cafe and its food is pretty good. They have OT contests but other than that, its all bad. One time they had the CEO by the office and he presented a video of the execs coming off of a private jet laughing while they presented us with a coin and a cookie for them reaching 20 billion profit. What a sham."
bad,"If you make one mistake they kick you out. No Warning they will fire you on the spot. So if you are a human good luck keeping a job. They dont understand when you make human mistakes. Also they have a group (like in high school) that will decide if they want to keep you or not. They do not know who you are, personal but they will decide you fate. You are just a number to them.Family Emergency dont matter to them either. They will kick you out.  Very picky about who they keep, if you dont fit in with the ""popular"" crowed they will kick you out. I wanted a job not to go back into high school"
bad,Not a very good place to work. They moved me to tampa just to pay me less money and fire me. There are a lot of things that need to change and that's all I am going to say about that.
bad,Where is the company to ever work for unprofessional and consistent company has a lot of flaws management will lie to you and act as if you’re covered for times remain off and then fire you over the phone
bad,Very dissatisfied with this company and I would not recommend anyone to work here.  I would not refer any of my friends or anyone I know to work for this company.
bad,I thought that they should not make customer service reps sell insurance. Its illegal but they get around it by the CSR not pressing the bind button but transferring at least 7% of transfers to other lines sales and the CSR gets nothing for the sell.
bad,Very cult like . A very leveraging and manipulative working style. Did not treat their agents with a partnership. Very heavy handed. Would not recommend as a good place to work.
bad,"At Progressive, there is no work life balance. They give you two work loads normally and in the Winter, its triple the work. You go to the office at 7 and leave at 9PM everyday. The management is disgusting. They treat you terribly and then expect you want to come to work everyday."
bad,"No work life balance. Too much work for one person to do in a day, it’s never ending. Management does not see you as a person. Do yourself a favor and do not get stuck with this company. Run!!"
bad,"Dictorial Manager who played favorites with Caucasian, male employees. Kown to allow discriminatory acts and language. Allowed Supervisors to publicly announce themselves as ""card Carrying members of the KKK)."
bad,"-Ensure that policy requirements are fulfilled to avoid any and all state and department of insurance penalties."
bad,Progressive Insurance doesn't like minorities. If you are an African American woman your chances become even lower. The nepotism in this place is mind blowing. Save your energy and your wonderful experience for another job. This company  allows discrimination at every level. Just keep searching.
bad,All I can say is poor company ..over worked by managers who do not look after their staff. Cut corners putting staff at risk. Don't care about their staff or putting them in bad situations. No support at all ..cowboys who try and take money off you when u leave for free training !!
bad,Stressful and underpaid. Management is horrible. Clients stay in home all day everyday. All vehicles are either old and nasty or they are broke down. Clients are treated horrible.
bad,"You are just a number in a revolving slew of new Employees. They set unrealistic expectations, micromanage everything, and try to act like they care when they clearly don't."
bad,"They would go into your voice mail, your email, critique everything you did. Super negative environment. Lots of turn over. Super high anxiety environment."
bad,poor work and life balance. not enough employees for the workload. I learned the claims industry and working with policies and negotiation tactics. Great benefits.
bad,"This is the WORST company I have ever worked for, "
bad,The ratio of men to women is about 75% to 25 %. You are okay if you are a straight white male or woman in utah but if you have any other orientation or religion that's not utah based you are outcasted.
bad,"they falsely advertise inclusion and good ethics however the managers could care less about team members, the environment is unhealthy and negative and the staff not ethical at all."
bad,Incompetent management with high and unrealistic demands make this job stressful and unsuccessful. There is no balance for work and family life. If you not in with the clicks then you are considered an outsider. If you are a threat to the company and don't fall inline with the sheep and cattle they will do everything they can to force you out of the company. Do not work for this company it is not worth your time and health.
bad,"The people that I worked with were very nice. The work pace was steady. Overall, as long as you completed your work and maintained good attendance, tm"
bad,Company strategy is constant change making it difficult to be consistent. Change for the sake of change is not a winning strategy. Hires recent college grads and works them to the bone. High turnover rate. Too much focus on numbers and not enough on actual customer service.
bad,"work load never stops, training is horrible,micro managing, no room to move up,work more than 8-5 without overtime pay, customer yelling at you all day.....if you like working 10-12 hours a day without extra pay this is the perfect job for you."
bad,This was not a very fun place to work at. Supervisors only helped the people they liked to succeed. I am glad that they closed the doors. Students loans are hard to collect on
bad,A typical work day involved running around writing estimates and closing claims as fast as possible.  If numbers were met you were fine but if you fell behind you were expected to work at all hours to get the job done.  Expectations were not reasonable and there was no work/ life balance.
bad,"The overall rating of 3.8 (at the time of me writing this review) seems to be a little bit inflated. It all comes down to your immediate supervisor. If you're lucky enough to get a supervisor who actually knows what they're doing and know how to not unnecessarily irritate their employees, then you should be fine."
bad,"The workload is crazy and the compensation is not worth the sacrifices"
bad,I clocked in and then I went to my line and made sure everyone was dong what they needed and then I got to my part and started sorting through the trash and throw away the things that cant go into the compacter
bad,"Taking calls and interacting with co-workers, working on more than one screen at a time. the jobs ive worked at were really enjoyable companies that cared about their co-workers and company and made sure everything was up to date as far as systems."
bad,They strictly higher people who can manipulate and have no long term professional goals. If you are in school and need a part time job I would only then recommend this company.
bad,"The job descriptions make it sound so good but, it is definitely nothing like the description!  They also come on here and other sites often to rate themselves higher to make you believe that people love working here. The majority of employees hate their job! Not enough payx too many calls to take, and not enough down time between calls makes for a stressful and unfulfilling work environment!  Trust me, you do not want to work here! Stay away!"
bad,"They sought me out, and I left them out. This place definitely has great perks (in house restaurant, fitness center, discounts), but after two months of self paced training, and three months of ""academy"" training and management rthat efused to allow me to succeed, I threw in the towel. They either like you or not. Many people leave here due to the ridiculously high rate of customer butt kissing you have to achieve to stay here."
bad,"they do not run business how they claim.  very wishy-washy"
bad,"I am not sure if Progressive is the issue, the management is the issue or if it is just this location. I had been at this job for a year before they fired me. The said it was performance issues. I was using too much auth misc. The let me go with no final warning or anything. Mind you, The whole year I was there I was receiving gift cards and rewards for my work. As soon as they did some rearranging in my department, I got a new manager and things went south ever since! I was the only ethnic person on the team, I was the youngest and I was the one with the least tenure. I guess he didn't like that. I NEVER got any customer complaints, write-ups NOTHING. But the manager let me go off of lies. We met once a week to review my performance. Each week he told me I was improving, then he ups and fires me. Then tries to deny me unemployment! How can he sleep at night!? I am not a bitter person at all. I own up to my mistakes. But i really did not do anything wrong to lose my job!"
bad,a great place to help people and grow business relationships
bad,hardly any work and pay is to low. Staff is not very professional hard to get in contact with someone and phone calls aren't returned in a timely matter.
bad,Management expects you to adhere to their policies and procedures but they don't appreciate the work you do as an employee. Their motto is there is always someone there to replace you!
bad,"Local and regional Management are bullies. Higher management is either clueless or doesn't care, we never saw or heard from them."
bad,Would never recommend anyone to work for this company especially in the west allis office.
bad,"Sweat shop Sales Dept call Center. You are a number not important to Mgmt. who micro Manage your every move. Low pay, low bonus,60 incoming calls at least per day that your Mgr will pick apart and write you up for no reason. They hired 400 temp Agents and started to fire Agents that had been there for years to get out of paying benefits and retirement. Progressive lost 52 % of last years profit and is trying to cut costs to the bone. Firing dozens of Agents each month and replacing them with Temps. Bad place to work. Do not go there. Pick oranges and be happy."
bad,This is a terrible company to work for unless you work in the field. If you are considering a position within the call center save yourself the time and look elsewhere.
bad,"Doing the same thing everyday. felt I could not breath. Management was not fair, co workers stab you in the back. Not getting enough credit."
bad,"Awful company. I was shocked! They are all about making money. Management is  a sad, dead eyed group who will treat you like a child and speak to you that way infront of others. They couldn't are less about their employees. No one is ever happy or smiling only stressed out because for the unattainable goals. Workload is completely unreasonable to be through as an adjuster. Don't waste your time.  Find a place who treats you like a human"
bad,Who your manager is makes a big difference on your experience there.  I happened to get a horrible one who goal was to make my life miserable. Heavy volume that cannot be done in 40 hours.  Worked 55-60 hours a week just to maintain.
bad,"Long hours, low pay, and stressful work.  Poor management support and no real opportunity for growth or advancement.  Good benefits and time off provided."
bad,"I began working at Progressive about 8 months ago. The application and hiring process took about 2 1/2 months from applied to hired. The first time I applied I was contacted and told to complete an assessment, which I did, and would be contacted shortly after. A week went by with no response, so I went through the whole application process, assessment, phone screening, etc and eventually was hired. Training was in a relaxed, classroom setting and from day 1 begins teaching you everything about insurance. After training, you go onto the call center floor for a ""probationary"" period of time. Quickly upon entering the call center floor and taking phone calls, I realized that the training does not prepare you for handling calls or customer requests. Comparing the training to the actual job is apples and oranges. This made the job incredibly stressful. I cannot say any part of the job was enjoyable. During training, they pump you full of Progressive Culture; feeding you the kool-aid so to speak. Then you get out of training and realize Progressive is just like any other evil corporation. They don't care about you as an employee, they don't care about your well-being, and they certainly don't care about helping you advance your career... Unless you're somebody's favorite, of course. Lots of favoritism and inconsistent treatment around this place. Getting out ASAP."
bad,"The vision and growth of this company is impressive at first glance.  However, the management is poorly trained, immature and it is run like a sweatshop. Those who are quickly advanced are related or married to supervisors. The management style is similar to 1920s run by fear and retaliation, especially in the NJ PIP Management team.  Claim denials are common practice and the State of NJ is  left with the  bills as most policy holders are Medicaid.  Turnover of claim reps is off the charts."
bad,"I thought I had found where I planned on retiring from, but I eventually realized they care about the employees who are robots and that are not honest with their employee engagement surveys. My prior office was horrible and people would cry daily at the workload. I busted my butt for that company and they screwed me over because the manager needed a scapegoat for his crumbling office. Integrity is important yet they still employ people who knowingly purchase food stamps from others and put it on social media and other staff who were married and cheating with coworkers in the clock."
bad,"Work load is EXTREME and Completely Unreasonable. The claims department is designed for failure. You will never catch up on work or you will NEVER get ahead. Management SUCKS. Progressive will work you until you BREAK and then just replace you with the next sucker. You will most definitely be suicidal after 6 months. Terrible Terrible Terrible , God awful experience."
bad,"Progressive is fine for those just out of college or between jobs while you look for something better, but very few people stick around long-term unless they are happy in a single role. They entice new employees with uncapped growth potential, but once you go 1-2 levels above your entry level position you realize that there is a very real cap on how far the majority of employees go. Inconsistent leadership and constantly changing standards, as well as regularly being expected to work more than the 40 hours you are salaried for is all part of the daily norm at progressive."
bad,They did not work with you if you were not grasping the material they literally threw you on the phones and hoped you stayed afloat. No coaching just beraiding and threats.
bad,"This is a company that did a bait and switch by advertising a ""no sales"" customer service position in their Riverview call center and then changing the role after training to ""requiring sales metrics be reached"" in a time when people can hardly pay their main bill, much less buy additional products."
bad,Nothing to add.  Work hard you will be rewarded. There is room for growth.  Be prepared to work more than 8 hours a day and for a fast paced environment.  Reaching deadlines and making quotas is important.
bad,"Some of the people were amazing.  I'd strongly consider doing substantial research on corporate structure prior to applying here. I did, however, have the opportunity to meet some amazing people along the way."
bad,Working for this company was terrible. Save yourself the stress and aggravation. This company operates by favoritism so the only way you move is by who you know or who you suck up to.
bad,I would NOT recommend working here to anyone.  They give you feedback and then never give you time to improve before telling you you've messed up again.  Not good training either.  Very short and basic and insurance is very complicated.  Not a good job.
bad,"Extreme constant pressure to meet unattainable goals. Clicky atmosphere. "
bad,"Management is not good. You always feel like you have a target on your back. Look out for yourself and don't trust anyone. They promote fear in senior leaders. They say they have an open door policy, but behind the scenes they frown upon it. Its all a show."
bad,The nature of an insurance company is to cut costs and maximize its shareholder interests. Progressive is very good at ripping off customers and employee salaries and resources. Don't work here. Stress and anxiety fueled company.
bad,Pay was good. Hours were long including bringing home work to be completed as well as phone calls being made. I enjoy a challenge and did not mind putting in the extra time.
bad,"I have been at this place for 2yrs now and regret everyday I'm here. If there were actual jobs out there, I would leave in a heart beat. The management treats their employees like garbage unless you suck up to them. I would never recommend anyone to even think about working here."
bad,Typical day at work:
bad,Typically assigned 12-15 medical claims per day which has to be processed along with your workload of previously assigned claims. You also have to review medical bills and other documents each day as well as interact and provide telephone services to the injured party.
bad,What this company tells you regarding the claims department and how you are treated as a professional are night and day. This employer does not do right by their employees. It was a very harassing work environment. Hostile unless a favorite or was seen and not heard.
bad,"I only made it to half the training period, the first week was all about how they support diversity of culture, not at all, it felt like being in a concentration camp while in training,I was mortified  from week one were I was made fun of and judge by another employee until week 4 that I decided to leave because I had enough when management decided to believe in gossip and comments that I never made"
bad,"Not a good company to work for ,, they take advantage and over work everyone . Everyone talked behind tour back and don’t give u support . Would not recommend very high turn over"
bad,"They have outrageous expectations for customer service reps. Things that are completely out of your control and they do not hesitate to fire you. They do not accommodate for a disability and they are very cut throat if you don’t make sale quota. Given, I was in the Auto Servicing department not sales, they still expect you to sale other types of insurance (home insurance, motorcycle, etc) and they will fire you if you do not make the sale."
bad,"No life outside of work.  They never staff appropriately.  You’re given three times the claims what you should be and yet, objectives remain the same. Management flies under the radar.  They do not follow federal law."
bad,"I was a claims adjuster working primarily in auto claims. The position with salaried.  Even though they advocate for work life balance there actually is none.  Needless to say, I did not enjoy my time working there"
bad,"I would not recommend working at Progressive to my worst enemy. I can’t say it’s a company wide issue, but working in one Atlanta area offices in Georgia is a nightmare. One on the offices is ran by someone who has the mental capacity of a 3 year old and often has tantrums like them. If you don’t like to gossip about your fellow employees or tell all of your personal business, you won’t fit in. The workload is ridiculous, you often get more claims than one person can handle, you get claims after the timeframe to contact people has expired or a few hours before and you are still held accountable. Quite honestly the pay is just not worth the headache. Most of the people there have been told in their positions 20 years or more and are bored with life so they try make yours as miserable as theirs!"
bad,There not understanding under any circumstances and they don't respect anyone there I worked very hard there and didn't get Respect or acknowledgement the whole time I worked there
bad,"don’t you dare think about putting anything or anyone before anything to do with Progressive. "
bad,"I’m so exhausted with Progressive I don’t even know where to begin. The job alone is stressful due to the workload and nature of insurance claims. That would all be well and good, maybe just a fun challenge, but working in an environment where rampant nepotism is covered up (poorly, I might add) by toxic positivity is another thing. At this point, it seems like no one’s even trying to hide it. If you’re not peppy and well-connected, moving up isn’t an option for you. This practice, on top of an already stressful environment is maddening. Management is more concerned with asserting their dominance over employees and posturing than actually working hard and making sure customers are dealt with fairly. Lastly, new employees are always hired making the same if not significantly more than well-tenured, successful representatives in the same position. Progressive doesn’t appreciate hard working, loyal people who have given years of their lives to the company. They value people who thrive on existing office politics, or are easy to control."
bad,"Low pay. Little recognition. Very little incentive to sell. More focused on their scripted sales process than they are on actually getting the sale. If your not a member of the LGBTQ community, you absolutely will not fit in at this place. They're so focused on promoting the LGBTQ, Progressive leftist agenda that they've lost their focus on obtaining a profit. Dont waste your time here."
bad,"Progressive used to be a Family, employee related company. Now they are nothing about the bottom line and numbers numbers. Turnover was 60% plus. Management was terrible."
bad,"Great job for a single person with no personal plans. You are expected to work 50-60 hours on your 40 hour salary. You can only meet the required metrics by over working yourself. They claim to care about family and personal time, they don't. Metrics and goals are God. Heavy favoritism from Management. Avoid this job if you are planning to have a family or life outside work."
bad,Very stressful no work life plus it’s not an hourly job.  Also the hiring process is a joke. I have a friend who applied and was  offered the job but after the background check nobody reached out to give her the go. Very unprofessional
bad,If I could give A BIG FAT  ZERO stars for management I would.  My last team leader and manager were terrible.  Any list of traits about what makes a bad manager matched them to a T.  People  are promoted by brown nosing not skill. People leave bad managers and team leaders. I’m glad I left and would not recommend this place to anyone. Also note people don’t retire from this company they quit. It’s sad because up until 2013 they had good management
bad,"Please do not apply here! I’ve been working at Progressive for a year and it is the WORST JOB I’ve ever had in my life. The workload is unmanageable, you are EXPECTED to endure the emotional trauma that comes a long with working this job. For instance, this company is METRIC based! You are lied to and told the standards are behavioral based, which is a lie. If you complain or seek help from a co worker or the manager will put you on an action plan. What is an action plan? A paper trail that consist of you getting one step closer out of the door. YOU ARE expected to work 55 hours plus every week to manage your workload with no overtime pay. The employees are afraid to speak up because management will write them up for “not being a team player.” People stay at this job (this is not a career) because of gainshare payouts. People the payout or bonus is not worth the emotional turmoil you will have to deal with daily. **PLEASE DO NOT APPLY TO ANY PROGRESSIVE JOB** unless you are desperate and do not have a car to become a Uber driver. This company is unethical and the workload is unmanageable. If you can handle 300 calls a day from needy customers, 40 voicemails from customers, 20customers picking up checks and signing paperwork at the local branch, and 8 new claims pending, with 20-30 work assignments pending on top of a ton of emails at the same time, this job is for you! Yeah, if you like taking a break or lunch daily don’t apply to this job.  If a robot worked here it would quit."
bad,This company does not care about the employees or customers. You pretty much have to suck up to try and get anywhere. They defintely will set you up for failure.management is very fake. I wish i would have took the reviews i read prior to accepting a potion more seriously....they were very accurate!!
bad,having an average call volume of 170 calls most days taking 250 calls. having a high turnover rate with people getting fired every week. company goals not being met
bad,"not as good as it appears. not supportive of people who are not cookie cutter, yes sir employees. or any persons who have personal tragedies or aging employees"
bad,"This place is TERRIBLE!  They pay sales reps a decent rate but with no commissions or bonus (don't let the ads fool you) You will NEVER get the bonus they offer.  They will come up with any excuse to say you did something wrong. Same with raises, any excuse not to give it to you.  Management team is a JOKE!  They are all friends and cover for each other's poor behavior."
bad,"Extremely high volume and unrealistic workload. Staffing is not managed appropriately, high turnover rate leading to employees be overworked and overwhelmed. Unable to complete workload within 40 hours/week, employees frequently come in early, work late, and work weekends. Management does not acknowledge the affect high volume has on results. Negative leadership. Salary is okay but health benefits through Aetna are strange and provide limited coverage"
bad,"Often times Progresive has good intentions but recently the changes in business and leadership has left a lot of experienced people in the background. After 5 years it’s expected that you never really change your role.  I would say if you apply for Progressive apply for the position that you intend on staying in for a very long period of time. "
bad,"Generally, workers got ahead by sabotaging each other rather than by doing legitimate work. Managers protected their fiefdoms and surrounded themselves with ""yes-men"". Projects poorly managed and rely heavily on unpaid overtime, so initial pay offer looks good until you find 60 hour weeks are normal."
bad,Management and HR are partial and unable to keep confidential information.  There is a severe lack of integrity throughout this company.  I would encourage people to look elsewhere.
bad,"This is not same shop it was 10 yrs ago. We all know places and people change and it's something we all have to accept. But ever since PCC bought this place some 3 yrs ago it's been on a downward trend that seems to have no end and nobody at the helm to bring it up. Generally manager, hr manager, production manager among others have absolutely no clue what there doing. It seems they place the companies failures on the people on the floor instead on the inept managers they have. It took weeks to get answer about anything, ( pay increase, vacation, production, evaluation, etc.) it was a nice little rodeo."
bad,the company always was concerned with business need first. you could not get time off for unexpected emergencies. the company always wanted more from employees and looked for ways to weed out low performing employees
bad,Yes this place is really off the wall. The assessment test has nothing to do with insurance or reasoning. It disqualifies many seasoned professionals because you forgot how to do Algebra 2.  The ads for people are up all the time. I wonder why?
bad,I was let go after being promoted near the end of Q4. They lied to me when I signed my exit paper work and now my unemployment for the 4 weeks I was unemployed had been denied. I have a two year old at home and did not eat to get by. The entire thing was per-meditated. I found out from a friend of mine they were planning on letting me go for weeks as well as others all the while smiling and acting as if it were normal.
bad,"I have years of experience meeting and exceeding goals in fast paced call center environment with other large companies and I can not seem to pass the online test. "
bad,"A typical day is like rush hour from the second you walk in until the second you leave. "
bad,"I worked there at 2 different locations, and the politics and work life balance made this one of the worst jobs I have ever had.  Everyone complains all day long, the Management is horrible.  It seems the only people that are in management are those without a personality and very dry.  They will buy you lunch 2x per week with the expectation that you sit at your desk and eat and don't take any breaks."
bad,"A typical work day includes numerous tasks."
bad,"A Typical day at work includes answering the door and incoming phone calls like a receptionist, not a claims adjuster. Work an excessive amount of claims daily. Very high expectations with your work, however not the same compensation for your hard work. I was a happy person, six months later as an adjuster for Progressive I was angry and miserable. I left this job and I'm happy again. IF YOU VALUE BEING HAPPY AT YOUR WORKPLACE and your life overall don't work as an adjuster for Progressive. You will regret it. If you don't have a problem kissing your manager's behind, then go for it. A few people there were set because their daily activity was kissing behind."
bad,"My typical day as a claims adjuster in the Central Claims Unit consisted of getting at least 10 new claims each day. In addition to each new claim, you are required to follow up on the prior claims that were already assigned to you and you are the only point of contact. You cannot answer any of your return phone calls because you are too busy trying to make calls to your new customers and your existing customers are frustrated because they cannot reach you, although you are specifically told to say in your voicemail that you are the most appropriate person to provide assistance."
bad,Management staff feels that FLO should be hanging from a cross instead of Jesus. Was lied to about compensation with sales. Was lied to about not having to meet a quota. No sales incentive for meeting goals. Everything is 'drawn' out of a hat for a small $125 monthly bonus. So someone else can make that small bonus who did not meet and exceed quota expectations as highly as you or someone else did.....and you can end up with nothing.
bad,"I was a non-exempt employee of Progressive in their HC office, meaning I was paid by the hour. After several years of loyal service to this company my employment was terminated. Although I had never had a bad review or been written up for anything, the last year I worked there I received two bad reviews and two write ups. I must say that these bad reviews were very suprising considering the performance of others in the office, who by the way received good reviews as well as pay raises for a much poorer performance than I was providing."
bad,Its been proven they have management and HR people leave positive comments about the company on sites like this. I worked for Progressive for ten years.... Don't be fooled. Talk to anyone walking out of the building how they feel about their constant nonstop workload and get a REAL opinion on working for Progressive. Walk into that office any day and you'll see tvs up on the wall showing how many people are on hold and how busy it is with green being light workload and red being nonstop headache having constant call after call. It is now ALWAYS lit up bright red. They even added something called GAP DAYS. On Gap Days they want you on the phone ALL DAY. Good luck having a chance going to the bathroom much less breathing with how busy it gets. Word is they had a GAP WEEK all last week. Its incredible to me how Progressive used to be a somewhat decent place to work for with reasonable workload before and now how they've taken advantage of the economy going bad and turned their workers into constant work load slaves. They've not only added more work but lowered pay...Hey someone has to pay for those obnoxious Flo commercials.
bad,"They are growing faster than they are hiring. People are being promoted and not able to handle the job. You will work all the time and no one cares, especially not management. People sit outside the building and cry, because they do not want to go back to work."
bad,"There was no work life balance at this job. No part time positions available only full time. During my employment, the company changed their time-off system, where you would input your request off into the computer system. The only way to request time off, and the only way to be approved for time off was if you used vacation hours. If you did not have any vacation hours, there was no unpaid time off. Period. We only obtained 5 hours of vacation each month, meaning it would take an individual two months to obtain one 8 hour day off. If you needed any additional time off, be prepared to work months in advance in order to bank time off. You were allowed 6 ""occurrences"" in a six month period, before you were fired for your attendance. If you called out of work, did a no call/no show, were more than 8 minutes late to clock-in for your shift, clocked out for lunch 8 minutes early, clocked back in after lunch 8 minutes late, or left work 8 minutes early the time frame rolled to 15 minutes on a sliding scale, and if this happened, you'd get an occurrence. Six occurrences, and you'd be fired. Not coming into work at all held the same weight as being 8 minutes late for work, you'd still get an occurrence. I saw about 80% of my cohort of coworkers fired because of attendance, when they were late a few times, had a medical emergency, had a sick child they needed to take to the doctors, etc. It didn't matter the reason, if you were late/left early/called out/or did a no call no show- you'd get an occurrence and after 6, you'd be fired. I had a death in the family and didn't have any vacation"
bad,"As a bilingual customer service rep you will be required to:  sell, sell, sell!. To translate for other departments accurately and fast as a professional interpreter with years of training would do! God forbid you don't translate the legal terms correctly you will get in trouble (because you may have caused Progressive to loose money). All this and more without differential pay."
bad,"Progressive treats employees like numbers. They do NOT care about their employees at all!  All they care about is numbers. They are not fully honest of about the job description up front, and they leave out that they expect us to soft sell homeowners insurance to customers. They will write you up if you can’t meet the number metrics. It’s constant stress."
bad,You are very overworked. You can either get stuck with a great supervisor or a terrible one (like any company). Company is not very family oriented. I think under compensated for the workload put on.
bad,"This place used to be a great place to work. Now internal and external customer needs not even a factor. All they want to do is cross sell. Imagine how hard it is to get a customer to get a renter quote when they can't even afford to pay their car insurance.  You will be expected to do so and it is your primary metric. If someone calls for Roadside Assistance they expect you to bring up one of their many cross sells as Paperless, Renters or Homeowners, talk to them about website because they really don't want you to call in. They don't care.  Taking care of the customer is not even a metric you will be rated on. Only cross sell. Also they use artificial intelligence so that will soon be taking those jobs. Artificial intelligence fields chats and customer calls and they will use your knowledge to train it. Empathy for the customer is penalized.  This job transitioned from Golden rule to counting their gold. They want you to take care of the business cross sell before you even address the customers need. They believe you have a better chance to sell if addressed up front.  I just think that's rude. Was expected to ask customer about Homeowners quote when customer was on way to funeral.  All of the good reps they are chasing out. That's why they have high turnover.  Most supervisors and managers  not skilled enough to take those calls thus making them inept to evaluate you as an employee.  Honestly you will have to think about how bad you really need a job because this job will cause moral injury. It was the wost job I have ever had and the worst I have been treated. Oh and if"
bad,NOT possible to  balance work. School let alone having a life. I was fulltime employer and fulltime student and there was no regards for that. The work loads traveled with me and therefore I spent time in class working instead of being a student
bad,You think you working customer service but once you in it’s mandatory upsale too. You have to offer PHA offers even though you don’t work in Sales. Worst mistake ever too Stressful of a Job.
bad,"They pride themselves as being and expectation based company. This means no matter how well your doing they will always find expectation that proves your not meeting standard. Very stressful, over worked, under paid, no work/life balance."
bad,"They don’t tell you how stressful this job is. When I was hired we were graded for how we completed and closed a claim. Then after gaining experience they wanted you to close the claim however and whatever it took. Managers were not helpful, everyone for themselves in this position. There’s no worklife balance. And they don’t care about you, even though they say they do."
bad,"If you're in it for the money then the money here is good.  That's the only reason to consider working here though and even then you would only want to work here temporarily."
bad,"Typical day would be addressing emails, voicemails/ incoming phone calls, making outgoing phone calls, and working on newly assigned claims. An Adjuster can get up to12 claims per day once you're put in the loop (after you complete training which is about 4 weeks). A lot of work given to Claims Reps, most of the time you will be overwhelmed. Not required to work overtime but you WILL have to work OT to keep up with the work load. OT is not paid. Sometimes OT is available certain times out the year but it must be approved by Upper Management. Part of your job requirements is to be available on the phone to take incoming claim related calls from all over while managing your own inventory of claims. You do not need prior insurance experience nor licensing with the state for this position. Workplace culture is good, great people from all different backgrounds/ages that work here. Hardest part of the job is trying to manage the workload. You can be successful based on the type of Supervisor/Team Lead you have...some are understanding, knowledgeable and really know the industry and know how challenging claims can be and always willing to help...others not so much and can make you're job even more challenging. This goes without saying, you will be stressed in this position, but it is what you make of it. You will develop thick skin working with upset customers which I believe is great as you will need it for any job/position in customer service going forward and also in life. If you're friendly, let the customers speak and show them respect a lot of times customers are pretty pleasant"
bad,"Unrealistic workflow expectations. You are told in the interview that you may need to stay late from time to time, but you soon discover that staying late often is the ONLY WAY to manage the volume. Leadership commends associates who work until 8 or 9pm despite their shift ending at 5 or 6pm.  Even an associate who has been in the role for several years and with the company 15 years often works until 8-9pm and on weekends to avoid being written up or possible termination. Leadership leaves at the end of their shift and you have to decide what ""the best thing for you"" is. Advancement is available for different roles because people want to get out of that job and it's demands. The Claims Adjuster position is kind of a bottom of the barrel spot."
bad,"Progressive management only picks favorites to succeed. Unless you are putting in free overtime, you are not moving up in the company. Working hard just isn't enough."
bad,"Progressive spouts a tremendous work life balance and rewarding career but once hired into the claims department you soon learn the truth. As the weeks pass the quantity of claims that are assigned steadily increase until you feel as though your in quicksand. My co-workers and I consistently work 12 hour days Monday through Friday plus a weekend day to have a fighting chance. They dangle a year end bonus to hopefully give you encouragement to carry on as family relationships suffer, weight gain plagues your existence and you begin to notice the depressing turn over rate. Your salary of $51,000 quickly turns into $30,000 with all the hours put in."
bad,"Progressive, looks great on paper, the co-workers are all great, but the work life balance is not that great.  As a Claims Adjuster in the call center you will have one day during the week off and one day during the weekend off, not back to back.  For Example, you will be off Saturday and off Wednesday.  Not much time for ""life."""
bad,"No work/home balance. All you are is a number and expected to produce/handle everything that comes in regardless of the volume. Hated this job,"
bad,It is a call center environment. You burn out quick and they make it very difficult to move up or even lateral through company. Quotas is how it run like most sales/call centers.
bad,"Cleveland’s commercial sales management is extremely unprofessional and degrading!  Especially a certain supervisor.  I was put down, treated like a child, had my job held over my head countless times, held back, and more.  HR is also horrible, and does not handle situations professionally at all.  I loved my job there and would have stayed if it wasn’t for the one supervisor."
bad,"My honest opinion about the Claims Adjuster position in the PCS/Liability department. This was my absolute least favorite position in my entire career. You come in as a Claims Adjuster Trainee and after about 3 months you then become a Claims Generalist . The workload is awful. Like others have stated, you will work at least 50-60 hours in a week. You are salary so no overtime there. I have heard of people coming in at 7am and leaving close to 11pm, and management doesn't blink an eye. It's almost as if working that much is the norm. It was common to skip your lunch break and you will have to bring work home with you just to keep from falling behind. This position is NOT for the faint of heart, wish I had listened to the warnings. I still have PTSD from working there. The stress was that bad."
bad,"The SIU organization is woefully managed.  The systems are designed so managers can review investigators' work as simply as possible - which becomes difficult when cases aren't so simple.  A million dollar case opened too long gets downgraded because it's open too long.  "
bad,"The cafe, game room, art, all the extras are great but the job is thankless and mentally exhausting. Customers mad every single call.. Call after call of people yelling at you,it wears you down."
bad,"They work you like three people.  They micro manage like your a child and don't know right from wrong. The management only cares about making money and they all think they know every thing. The people are all fake that work there.  It was all gray, the wall and the floor. so depressing.  I did not enjoy it there at all."
bad,The job had no advancement and the management was non directional and only in it to make themselves look good no matter the cost to the employees. It was all about looking good to the higher ups.
bad,"Long hours, large workload, little support, met some good people there, sedentary job so you are sitting for a long period of time, staring at computer screens all day"
bad,"and I'm not even exaggerating.  my immediate manager was a great guy, but the office manager above him was not pleasant at all.  and don't expect to make much money or see your family.  you'll be on the road constantly."
bad,"Great training.  Welcoming environment when you start.  They ramp you up to ""full load"" claims handling over about 6-12 weeks.  Initially, you get a ton of support.  They have company sponsored lunches and outside events which are nice.  The bonus potential rivals 10% or more of your annual salary and is paid out right before Christmas, so that aspect is great."
bad,"I lost my license, my heath, and my enthusiasm for loving my job  Even though they request a poll to access work environment  nothing was done when I complained of the unfair treatment."
bad,Management is bad and they don't help you as far as training goes they just throw you out on the floor and expect you to be verbally abused by customers on the phone and take it then I'm not understanding that the customer service reps are doing all the work why is the CEO making a million dollar bonus every year. The only thing good about this company is the benefits
bad,The company will not hire enough staff to compensate for the amount of volume they receive on a daily basis. They do not provide overtime and expect you to work until the job is done even if it is everyday.
bad,"I do believe that some areas of Progressive (IT, Marketing) are great. But do not get in to claims. The most inadequate people (no college degree, no professionalism, have been at the job for 6 months) get promoted in to management. Management could care less about work/life balance. If you don't work more than 40 hours a week there is no way you are getting all of your work done. The room for growth in claims is very limited as a lot of people are trying to get the same promotions."
bad,"Its a job but its not stable, just do your job and look for a new one when there. They will not address anything but just fire you. 6 month job only."
bad,I really enjoyed helping people. It made me feel good to know that i was making someone else. the look on people face when i come in in the morning.
bad,"High stress work environment, company has changed a lot in past 7 years and did not like or agree with the business direction"
bad,"I have worked for Progressive Insurance for 5 and a half years and in the time I was there I developed work skills as such as working with computers, learning about insurance and how claims take place. I have also developed a lot of personal relationships within my co-workers. I am looking now for other opportunities and room to grow within a company."
bad,"recent changes to the firm have made this the absolute worse place to work in house. poor handling of work, case load, way too may processes and just a poor understanding of how law firms work by upper management. you're overworked and under-appreciated. you can do better"
bad,"Employee morale is extremely low, no management support for unattainable work load.  Poor training process and work life is disappointing.  Company isn’t transparent about work load and job expectations.  Hierarchy management style.  No access to leadership personnel.  Not an EO employer.  Unattainable, unrealistic goals"
bad,Life work balance is non existent. Management is quick to change procedures before trying them to see all the possible actions that could occur. Pay was well worth it.
bad,"I applied three times before scoring an in person interview. The interview process was a tad daunting consisting of a phone interview, assessment, and two in person interviews. I applied for a customer service position, but instead was funneled into a claims representative position in centralized auto after the assessment. I initially thought this was an amazing opportunity, but found quite quickly that I was sadly mistaken. The initial training consisted of being stuck in a room not permitted to talk for days cramming information for the licensing test. After, the claims or liability training began, it taught the very basics of claims but did not by any measure prepare me for the intense boot camp that would come later. Boot camp was awful and I excelled at it. The leads did not want to answer questions and yelled constantly often embarrassing other employees. The order training commenced during boot camp was not efficient and left many holes. I graduated boot camp with awards and led my assigned team for 11 months with little to no official acknowledgment. After a year I was completely burned out, used and abused. There were times I found grown women crying at their desk or in the restrooms because of the stress of the workload. Vacation time and sick time came with demerits and the supervisors could not personally approve any time off as it was done through an automated system that often approved employees by seniority, wait listing anyone there for less than two years. We were to process up to 14 claims a day, making sure to triple call, leaving two voicemails, a text and"
bad,"Micromanagement. Your every move and call mode monitored. I work in PHA and PAA for 2 years. In this position you need time after the call the enter data and email homeowners paperwork. If you are in AUX 4 for too long - say 4 minutes - someone would skype you asking ""Hey, I noticed you have been in AUX 4 for 4 minutes. Are you ok?"" Yeah I am ok. Its called working back off! I left this position b/c I was tired of being treated like a child. The homeowners department head would run out of the office if there are 3 calls on hold asking trainees to jump on for 10 minutes of overtime. People would say "" Our coaches are not here yet and I am not to familiar with the platform."" Meanwhile 3 supervisors for HO is laughing and hanging out. How about you ask those A $ $  kissers to jump on. So glad I left. If you read this I hope it inspires you to leave the position or just avoid it. Cheers."
bad,"Terrible environment"
bad,"you will love the employees you work with. The management is the problem. The managers in place are not skilled in their role. The workload is not manageable. You get dinged on reviews if you are not able to keep up. Here's the kicker, no one could keep up. everyone had a back diary. Management needs to have a complete overhaul."
bad,Work long hours. work through lunch breaks. Very stressful. lots of micromanagement. hard to move up any where besides claims. not able to have any type of work life balance. just say no
bad,"If you are a workaholic this is your company."
bad,races and bias of people unfair management hr department unhelpful not the best company to work for  if you could apply for farmers or anywhere else by all means do it
bad,"Work load was very unrealistic.  Credit for work done was never given to those deserved.  Too many managers within same departments, this caused a lot of problems."
bad,They expect you to work till work is done
bad,"No matter how many accolades and awards you received, and how many years you have worked for them,as soon as you reach 72 they will find a reason to let you go!"
bad,"They lie they do not have your back they dont follow their own policies no thing good to say"
bad,"I have work at call centers for more than 20 years and I’ve seen great place and down right scary places but Progressive is the oddest. I was hired by a third party company for Progressive. I went through training and all during it was assured that as long as I was progressing with my training I had nothing to worry about. After 6 weeks we hit the floor, I had some difficulties mainly because Progressive has so many things they want you to offer customers and even though they say they don’t have scripts they do! With the help of my coach I was progressing with my training or so I thought. After work one day I received a call from the third party company telling me Progressive decided to terminate me because I was let progressing at their speed and to not even bother dropping off my badge cause it wouldn’t work anymore. Progressive doesn’t value experience they only care that you offer everything that they sell to customers over the phone even upset customers. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone!"
bad,"you are given unrealistic goals and in training""ACADEMY"" its rainbows and unicorns the min you hit the real world in CCU claims its caca you DROWN especially if your not an organized person and GOD forbid you get ILL or use FMLA because once its gone GOOD luck they are quick to boot your out!!"
bad,"unrealistic expectations"
bad,Some of the rules for the job that i did were horrible and unlike any other call center that i have ever worked for in a very bad way and i would not recommend working there to anyone
bad,I do not think anyone is truly happy at Progressive unless they work in the claims Department. I worked in Customer Service and hated my job and my shift.
bad,"They were not fair when it came to training. I got let go because i had one 1:1 meetings with my supervisor and because i wasnt getting better i got let go. They expect you to teach goals but they said it's not ""sales"" you get put on performance management if you dont meet you quota"
bad,"This is not a company that I would like to work for again, it was not a good experience. You always have to been on the phone they do not give time to breath."
bad,"Was hired to be a software developer, but they did not have nearly enough work to be done, and the rest of the team was located at the main office in Ohio, so there was 0 mentorship or chance for advancement. Waste of time."
bad,"I used to love it, but after years of being completely stressed out by the unrealistic expectations and workload, I cannot say I enjoy any aspect of it anymore."
bad,"Leadership in this company was horrible. The values or direction the company was going, was forced on all employees. No feedback was ever listened to."
bad,"Many good things here in terms of a beautiful campus (food is a bit expensive) lost of nice amenities such as a free gym (if you go 12 times a month). games available for breaks-they always celebrate your birthday. beautiful artwork the company invests in. Most people are very nice, a few evil managers but that is everywhere. Horrible shifts for the first 6-8 months. easy to make the numbers they expect but no bonus for over achievers. Overall a good company to work for."
bad,The job is stressful. Management is awful. Training is ridiculous. They expect you to perform exceptional however they do not provide the platform to do so. Managers nick-pick every decision that you make. Trainers that were more interested in discussing sports than helping you with your claim questions. Meetings that run too long on issues that could be addressed by email.  The only positive thing that I can say about the company is that the benefits are good.
bad,Great company to work for. Great training and good management team.  The office politics were very terrible here. The human resource specialist really did not know how to handle people or particular situations. You were brought into other peoples situations and  forced to pick between your collegue or management .  Sabotage during competitive jobs also occurs at this establishment . If you’re “not in” you’re “not in”. The culture really needs to change.
bad,Was let go due to a medical issue. Don't recommend if you want a life of any sort or have children or any sort of medical condition. Great people but horrible work conditions.
bad,This company paid well and had good benefits but the communication to do your job was cliquish and selective (who you drank with).  The upper management was very good but middle management played favorites
bad,"The compensation and benefits were fare. During the slow seasons the job is a dream. During the peak it can be a nightmare, like most jobs. The people I worked with were great, very low drama. But this company does not promote from within often. The Top Sales manager at the place I worked (Hilda) would rather Hire people from outside the company, pay to license them,  train them for weeks, throw them into the job with very little knowledge of the systems and policies. Instead of take tenured and knowledgable employees and train them into having strong management skills. This has an extremely negative effect on the employees. Turn out rate is terrible because the management is some of the worst I've ever seen, people who have been there a long time eventually leave because they realize they have no options. New people leave because every manager is inconsistent and wants different things. It is extremely hard for employees to respect there supervisors when most of them were hired into the company recently and have only spent 4 hours a week on the phone and they are trying to ""coach"" you into selling better. The Phoenix call center would do much better if they completely restructured the management. Progressive as a whole is not a bad company, the whole issue is the Phoenix call center and I believe Progressive need to start investigating whats going on there before they lose more money."
bad,Company cares about your compensation. Management isn't always the best. They don't tell you really what your getting into in the interview or in training
bad,"Started in January as a temp employee.Was terminated in July. Had an extensive interview with Progressive,didn't pass wasn't hired as a permanent employee.Months later another opportunity came along,my supervisor said I could reapply but again would have to take the telephone interview,and the one on one interview again! At this time I told her I wanted to decline,but maybe next round I would reapply.I told her at this time I wasn't ready,and seriously had some doubts about working here permanently. Weeks later, I spoke to a recruiter for advice,went back to my supervisor and told her I had a change of heart,and would like to be considered for the next round of interviews for the CP1 Claims Position.When I was there I was out sick 1 day, 99%on time.Was friendly, upbeat,sometimes a little too loud. But when I look back I enjoyed for the most part my  co-workers! I however did not feel comfortable around some of the managers! I know in the State of Florida,employers do NOT need to give a TRUE reason for termination.However,it is too say the least really unprofessional,and sad that my recruiter called me on a Sunday morning informing me that I was terminated!!"
bad,"they give you more work than what you can do in 8 hours, and have very unrealistic expectations. be ready to work long hours with no work life balance. management expectations is not realistic for the work volume."
bad,"Worked w. Progressive for MANY years.  Dont expect to further your career, no matter how much you educate yourself.  Apply for many jobs and was denied.  My latest application I applied for, denied because says I'm not qualified enough.  My degrees, training, certifications and licensing and knowledge was nocked off over someo e who has half of this knowledge and education.  I LOVE this field but now am know discouraged and wi booking for another job."
bad,"Understaffed, more work than one can handle. Push you through training as fast as possible. Managers and supervisors have favorites, not loyal to anyone. Primarily female employees that think they’re untouchable. The girls will band together to push the men out. Supervisors openly talk trash about other employees, shady corporate environment. Proceed with caution."
bad,"It was a job that required speaking with customers interested in auto insurance. You had to sell auto, motorcycle, RV, boat, and home/renters insurance."
bad,"The pay is good, benefits great...not to many places make you fully vested in your 401k from day one. However, when I started I was told several things about scheduling/pay. I was told that we are entitled to a raise at the beginning of the year and that we would be able to bid on a new schedule within a couple of months. The manager who interviewed me said I was coming in at a great time because they were going to be hiring 50+ employees after me and I would be high on the seniority list. their seniority was based on time in the position not the company. He told me this because I would be higher up on the seniority list and I should get a better schedule than I was assigned when I was hired. 6 months came and went and finally the bid came out. I did not get my schedule I requested, only to find out that they changed the bid policy without informing the employees...my guess is that they did not want to explain themselves. Then the beginning of the year came and in my eval they advised me that i was not eligible for a raise since I had not been there long enough. Then a month later I found a posting for the position I had at a higher rate of pay. when I brought this to my supervisors attention he said he would get back to me. Three more times I asked about that and I never got an answer. I worked there a year, I out lasted more than 50% of the 18 people that were hired with me. You are replaceable there and they let you know that on a daily basis...once a year they throw a party and say thank you. thats the only time you will ever hear a thank you. If you want to be worked to"
bad,Progressive as a company is great. Being an adjuster though you are overworked and management is terrible. Everyone in my office is on the verge of a mental breakdown (some already quit for this reason).
bad,"Don't be fooled by their job ad. If you can not work from home, don't bother to apply. I applied for the customer service in facility option. Went through assessment test, phone interview when i got to the on site interview, she told me the facility option is not available anymore. Only work at home. I asked why.  You put the ad a week ago thought. She didn't have an answer to me she just told me 60% of their service people work from home.  Even though i finished the interview but i already knew i would not get the job because i told her i did not want work from home. Progressive want to put the operation cost burden on their workers to maximize the company profit. It is not a honest company. That is why my whole family use state farm.😂😂😂."
bad,I was selected for interview and immediately told that the position had been filled prior to the phone interview. Seemed more like the interview was nothing but practice for the person who called.
bad,"Progressive's mindset is a wonderful one. However, there are managers/supervisors that enjoy micromanaging employees, setting unrealistic expectations, and overall making their employees feel defeated each and every day that they walk through the door. In this industry, you deal with people at one of the worst moments in their lives---having managers that have a lack of social skills only adds to the stress of the job. I was going to work, and progress through the company--however the management that is at the Lewisville Texas location caused me to hate my job and leave."
bad,"When I originally applied for Progressive, everyone had said what a great company this was to work for. The pay for me is great, the benefits great, and hey the hours aren't bad. I don't mind the job, as far as what it entails (following detailed guidelines and helping customers in any way regarding their insurance). Here's the thing about Progressive though... if you're applying for this job be prepared for stress. It is a long training process for some people, and when you're going through that process it's not easy all the time to leave that at work. Now, working on the phones, it can be a heartbreaking process. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that you do get to help (some) people, however, the worst part about the job is that it is highly stressful experience."
bad,"It is a fun place to work, lots of incentives but very very competitive. Job and life balance is a plus, because you get a lot of time off.  A lot of people I knew there, would train in the office and then become a work at home person.  Lots of employees liked that."
bad,"room for growth, no work life balance, able to bring computer home, great benefits for employees, employee engagement is fun, job is stressful and too many claims for one person."
bad,On a normal day I would take 8-14 phone calls. The amount of information to remember is high and the job was stressful especially for someone who was new to a call center environment
bad,"Rules are different for every body"
bad,"I have worked at Progressive for sometime, and I must say that I am not satisfied at all with the direction the company is going in. I work in a unit where the manager can't manage and cries (literaly) about everything. There is no direction or anything. It is so disfunctional. The work load is ridiculous and then on top of that they tell you they understand but slap more work on your plate. It is very stressful and if it weren't for being a mom, I would have walked out. People are leaving the company left and right to our competitors because the atmosphere is terrible. The morale is down and the dread of going to work is constant. The company itself isn't bad, but it's the people you have running it that makes you hate it. They say the grass isn't always greener or the other side, but I truly regret leaving my past employer to come work here....Good luck to anyone who's thinking about pursuing a career with Progressive..Oh by the way, there aren't many opportunities for advancement, so if you are looking for a career, Progressive isn't the place to go."
bad,"Incompetent, uneducated management.  My last boss couldn’t make a subject and verb agree if you held a gun to his head.  Very long hours and very stressful job."
bad,"During training the instructors encouraged new-hires to not use all of the break-time entitled to us... they wanted you to deduct from your lunch or break buckets instead of using the bathroom break code. "
bad,"Progressive had a somewhat relaxed family like work environment. They did lack in many areas however like:"
bad,"A lot of the people on that spread was on drugs and it was by far a safe place to work. I met some of the the Superintedents and foremans that was on other spreads an they were awesome, fantastic people. But the spread I just do happened to be working with was terrible."
bad,It is a busy place to work.  It used to be a great place to work.  It is no longer that way.  There is not respect from management to the employees
bad,"Great training on how to go over coverage definitions. You are able to control your lunch,breaks and time off. Pay is too low for all you do, most can barely eek out a living."
bad,"Several years ago, this was a great organization to work for. You worked hard and were rewarded with little perks (i.e., outings, bonus, etc.) and th environment at work was close to a family. The team was cohesive and helped each other achieve goals, which were then celebrated. However, due to major restructuring of management and claims positions, and change to more lean concepts, the workplace has become extremely difficult to succeed in. Employees are expected to keep up with an increasingly high claim volume, and if you cannot, they will find a way to let you go/push you out the door, and will consistently look over your shoulder and put pressure on to achieve better results. Then, they expect you to pick up the slack for employees who are let go for poor performance. Also, major changes to benefits made health insurance horrible. This would be an OK job for someone out of college who can put in crazy hours to gain experience, but not for anyone looking for work-life balance or ability to move up in the company."
bad,"Great co-workers.  Pretty good pay, just not for what they expect out of you.  Top notch training.  Take a much as you can out of them before they get all of you.............then move on."
bad,"If you are looking for work life balance this is not the place for you.  If you get sick, hospitalized, break a leg, cant breath and you have to call out or leave early you will get written up.  The only plus was the training and it was Outstanding from start to finish, after training you are put in a nesting period which is also pretty cool.  After that you are fed to the wolves (supervisors/managers).  The managers are so out of touch its ridiculous.  I did'nt know who our director was until he changed departments. I mean the list goes on.  I was very disappointed at Progressive because its such a large company."
bad,"Fast paced standards are high, but so are most of the emplyees. If you are not in the top 5% may as well start looking again. If you go through Innosource don't expect to make their head hunters and don't care about you, just want the money."
bad,"worked 10 hour days"
bad,"There was no consistency in business practices or hiring and promotions,  Very sexist toward women and territories are not divided fairly.  Upper management is like the good ole boys club.  Remote jobs without any support from management and/or sales team.  Lots of after hour work after putting in a long 15 hour day, not appreciated and takes away from family life.  You always had to be on call for VP's and management at the top of a dime."
bad,"At first they really make you feel welcome. You go through tons of training.  For incompetent people this training is good. For the competent ones you are beaten to death (metaphorically speaking with too much training) the harder you work and the better you do they pile on more and more work. The other employees that are just there for a check get away with everything.  They know exactly how to work the system. Your calls are constantly monitored, your computer activity is constantly monitored.  The overal ethics of the company is horrible. They want you to constantly answer phones. There is no challenge to the job. You are only allowed 5 occurrences in a 12 month period. Meaning if it was not previously scheduled time off (which is almost impossible to get) and you are more than 7 minutes late or you have to call out you only get 5 times to do so and then you are put on a written warning. At any given time there are about 300+ calls waiting to be answered and as soon as you hang up from a call you immediately get the next. If you work a 10 hour shift you get 1.5 hours worth of breaks for that entire shift which is your food, bathroom and any other time you may need/want. That may seem like a lot but considering the position it is nothing. At the interview they make it seem like a great place to work b/c they will mention the gym and the cafeteria but what they dont tell you is the cafeteria is only open 5 hours a day monday to friday only and they close at 2pm usually you can never go to the cafeteria due to the shift they give you. The gym is great but again you only get"
bad,Same as prior notes. The company has good and bad points. The new style management adopted a process based on profit for stock holder with little to no regard to long term employment.
bad,"Progressive is a hellish place to work. They set you up to fail. Employees are made to feel that their jobs are at risk, it is hard to get time off. The pay is not worth the aggravation of dealing with their customers. The company has very unfriendly customer and employee policies."
bad,"Supervised the product line."
bad,They will continue to add more work until you collapse. They create a situation where you have no ability to keep up and then use all that against you every year come raise time.
bad,"Work life balance that Progressive takes pride in is great if you don't have a family. Expect to work 50+hours/week once you get off on-boarding (training) and go onto salary. Training is very basic and once you get started, if you don't have a good Manager and/or Mentor who is willing to help you step-by-step through the claims process after training; expect to train yourself and rely on your co-workers to help you."
bad,"These people will burn you out and then fire you. They lie and say its not a sales job but as soon as you finish training, there are mandatory sales requirements. If you do not comply/cant make the sale, you're fired. If someone calls in to cancel a policy because due to the death of a loved one, you are REQUIRED to sell them more products that they do not want. It will make you sick to your stomach and then you will get yelled at for not selling the product properly. Do not work at Progressive unless you want to get fired within the first month"
bad,"This is a great company if you're looking for a stepping stone in the call-center world. Just understand that they will use you and abuse you until you're no longer useful to them, then they'll replace you with someone they can pay a lower wage. They care less and less about their customers and employees alike,  but that rainbow diversity flag they wave serves as an acceptable facade for actual human kindness toward their employees. But hey, gainshare, so wooo, I guess??"
bad,"Culture, Management, HR, Career Development, opportunities for  advancement could all be much improved. Too much fat in the Supervisory level and needs to be radically changed for the betterment of customers, employees & the business. Employees & customers are human beings & should be treated as individuals; not pawns or cattle in a numbers game."
bad,"PROS:Initially upon being hired I was excited. They politically promote various things I do not agree with. I don't care about them but would not openly support them but I seriously wasn't ""bothered"" by it enough to pay attention to it. I truly believe everyone has a right to their own views, ideas and opinions and those should not be infringed upon. As they promoted they felt the same. The people are very hard working and very kind. I appreciate that. There is no high school bullying mentalities that I have seen in so many places. For that it is like a breath of fresh air! BUT...the cons out weigh this heavily. "
bad,"Overworked underpaid....we constantly hear about how great the company is profiting, but can't tell based on the benefits. Every few years the medical gets more expensive."
bad,Be prepared to work 70-80 hrs a week with no overtime to stay on top of your case load. No support from management. At first there is a cushion and they make it seem manageable but it is not.
bad,"Just writing to weigh in so as to share my own experience as well as my opinion regarding both the online assessment and the telephone interview process."
bad,"Lacks work/life balance.  Stale Management.  Favortism exists. "
bad,"Handled inbound calls from around the US to help customers with their insurance needs.  Worked in a cubicle all day with very little interaction from others.  Good company and good benefits, but not for someone who enjoys working face to face with people."
bad,"Chained to the desk all day by your phone like some prisoner of war, the phone constantly dinging in your ear. You don't get paid more for becoming licensed, even though that makes you more of an asset to the company. Instead they load more work on you and screw you over with your time off."
bad,The culture at this company is to cover your butt at all times at all costs. Stress level is a 10 on a 1-10 scale. Training is insufficient and employees are left to learn on the go. Not a company I would recommend for a career.
bad,I have been with Progressive a little over a year.  I feel as though I was thrown into the fire soaked in gasoline.  The company on a whole has excellent core values but somehow these values do not make it down to the claims office level.  There is no work life balance and no one cares.  HR is a joke and nothing gets done to help employees.   As a claims adjustor there is a mandatory Saturday every 2 months but turned into every month because upper management refuses to adequately staff.  The workload is unbearable and it is impossible to be sucessful without working ridiculous amounts of overtime for free since we are salaried employees.
bad,"Progressive hires kids out of college and trains them there way, which is not the way the insurance industry operates.  If you need training to become a claims adjuster then start off here but get ready to find a new job within a year.  Once you become to good or expensive they will lay you off anyway."
bad,The general manager is a tough person to work for when back door deals are made and the team doesn't know.
bad,"My immediate co-workers were great, however, the company had people in supervisory positions that did not have any experience and did not really know how to communicate well with others in the department."
bad,I worked for this company for over a year and a half at first in the training it's a tad overwhelming if you don't have experience in auto insurance they also fill your head full of empty promises and expectations when she go through the gauntlet of training and Academy and coaching they throw you to the wolves this company will ding you for reaching out for assistance on a complexity of a call they also will Dean you if you don't upsell a product like homeowners or renters
bad,Was not a good experience working for the company. Policies would constantly change without any type of communication to staff. Time was not given to review changes.
bad,Sales is all scripted and you have to follow their way to handle the call and not allow you to bring your own personality into to conversation with the potential customer.  I don't want to be robot
bad,"all they care about is sales and metrics even if you are not knowledgeable and you manage to transfer caller for homeowners quotes then thats all that matters,if you like to sit and take calls back to back,talk to difficult customers and earn okay money then go for it.schedule flexibility is available too"
bad,We wake up at 4 we have to measure our holes and drill holes we pour concrete Tuesday threw Saturday and set string line as we go so the equipment can run properly
bad,they are to hard and strict on you. get in trouble for every little thing. you dont have breathing room. you dont get raises. the management dont care about you. they will not work with shifts.they wrote me up for missing one day after i was told i could miss 16 hours. not enjoyable at all. feel like im in prison
bad,Very stressful. No concern for employees health.  Down grade of benefits yearly. Constant change without notice. Older employees get  passed over for promotions
bad,Learned a lot.  Time for growth. Seeking more flexibility and better compensation.  Lack of leadership in local management.  Inconsistency with accountability and enforcement of office best practices.
bad,"The Good: "
bad,"Professional environment. Good location, hours. Little room for advancement.  Coworkers are ok. Fun work environment."
bad,"They spend a lot of time convincing their employees of their culture but don't follow through. Training was great but being on the floor was a nightmare. Call volume was high all year around, manager would only provide numbers if your metrics were low and did little to support or help with fixing metrics. CSR job is really a sales position. No support for escalated calls/cancel requests. Pay was great but not for the stress it induced. I was always given additional tasks outside of my job description to 'prepare' me for an advancement that never happened. Turn over at this company is high for a reason."
bad,Its a do as I say not do as I do culture. Management thinks your job is to make their job easier when the reason they have a job is because of you. The customers are treated better than the employees.
bad,"Progressive does not value advanced degrees or CPCU designations which, unfortunately, slowed my career. Moreover, most managers from branch to regional were most unprofessional, often boorish and even buffoonish.  To be frank, it seemed most of the male managers still thought they were in a fraternity house and acted accordingly. For example, cherry bombs were exploded in the parking lot, men would use the women's restrooms, cursing and outright yelling at employees was common, etc."
bad,A typical work in the casualty department is very busy. You will work anywhere from 8 hours up to 12 hours. I've learned to ask about a healthy work/life balance before signing up for a position. The management behaviors differ. You can interact with one supervisor who is super friendly and helpful and on the other hand you can work with an supervisor that is overwhelmed and can't offer that support system.
bad,"Progressive makes sure you feel secure in the work you are doing, they take the time needed to train you properly. Incentives are great."
bad,"Progressive has huge market potential. It truly is an original idea when it comes to financing a credit challenged consumer market. However, recent changes to management have brought with it scattered policies and unbridled confusion. The company has grown top heavy and now has too many Chiefs and not enough Indians. It was a good company to work for and an even better company to leave."
bad,"Don't buy into what they sell you in training and interviews. If you apply for a customer service job they will say you are not going sell anything. I am here to tell you Progressive will require you to ""sell"" in their customer service positions. Progressive will require you to make offers for homeowners and renters insurance on every call. If you do not make the offers it will go against your metrics and will possibly cause you to get a write up."
bad,I learned a lot and got my license for property and casualty insurance. With that license and the knowledge of selling commercial insurance. I was given valuable tools.
bad,"Poor management, lack of advancement opportunties, had 9 different managers over the course of 2 years who provided inconsistent management, little support for employees"
bad,"This is a company that only cares about numbers and not about there employees. It’s a high stress environment, it’s a company that takes a lot from you and does really Compensate."
bad,"While this place did provide training to its employees, it seemed as if they mainly catered to people that were bilingual.  The supervisors definitely were helpful but overall not my best place of employment."
bad,If you like being micromanaged and treated like a child and not a professional this is the job for you.  There is room for advancement but within limits.  Benefits are pretty good.  There was definitely a cliquish vibe to the company
bad,"they were meh, they rush to license you in all 50 states to be able to take a lot of calls and when you master the craft they nit pick on verbiage because they have nothing better to do"
bad,"Training is thorough, but once you receive your workload it explodes out of control. Weekends are the worst especially during the winter time. People quit without warning and you end up with their work on top of what you can barely catch up on. It's not worth it."
bad,I have nothing to write in this section but I am being forced to do so as it is the only way to complete this review.  there is no method to opt out if you do not want to give a review
bad,They would hold a certain group to one standard and and another group to a higher standard. If there was a customer complaint all the guidelines went out the window. Never knew where you stood.
bad,"The poor work environment reflected the Regional Manager at the time. Not sure what the current environment is like but they finally got rid of her. Long hours are the norm, including nights and weekends for salaried employees."
bad,"Despite having many perks such as catering, team building exercises and a fun environment the actual job itself involved unattainable goals and a cut-throat management designed to belittle and berate employees.  Would not recommend."
bad,"Very fast paced, long hours, nights , weekends, holidays. Constant turnover and no real job security. Unrealistic work load and job expectations. Sweat shop."
bad,"- typically you would arrive to work early"
bad,soo long ago cant remember a lot of specifics but overall a good company to work for.  Have always been ahead of their time.  More like a technology company that sells insurance
bad,"no work/life balance "
bad,"Its a tough fast paced job with constant stress. Managers are micromanagers and not very interested in you, but interested in making goals and numbers at all costs."
bad,"I have been there for five years.  The pay is good, and there is a bonus at the end of the year, but working in House Counsel is a nightmare.  There is not enough staff for the volume of work that comes in and management consistently turns a deaf ear to it."
bad,"Shortchanging employees and customers to maximize growth had become the driving force over time. The talk on the interior was"
bad,"If you have prior experience, need not apply. They don't like it. "
bad,"Hands down the worst place I have worked at ever! The so called coach cancelled several coaching sessions and was nothing but critical. It was not constructive feedback it was an hour of bashing me and pointing out all my flaws whilst telling me how great the employee was that was slated to come in next after me for coaching. The manager was never around EVER!! They would throw around idle threats and write people up for things they were not even doing. The training is HORRIBLE, it is literally someone throwing an overwhelming amount of insurance information at you and hoping some of it sticks when in fact you need to know all of it!! Horrible place to work!!"
bad,"Management was inept and lack claims knowledge to correctly handle claims. Extremely busy work environment. Extremely micromanaged making job hard to complete efficiently and productively. Enjoyed opportunity to meet or exceed expectations of customers,"
bad,"Training is all web based. You better pick it up or you will have a problem, recently the company has undergone upper management overhaul.  Everything is all about the money, they say they are about customer service but it is all about the money. The job has become matrix and numbers, if you cannot cross sell enough product and meet the continuing changing required monthly matrix , your job is threatened.  Shifts are now by bid and by performance, so again if you do sell enough , then you go to the bottom of the bid , they have no issue letting you know that you do not meet their needs.  It has nothing to do with customer service and performance, it is only about numbers and money. Not a fun place to work."
bad,"I've worked at progressive auto for a while now. We always tell people they can get a discount by adding renters insurance. But we don't tell them that they have to pay for it. We tell them they have to answer 5 questions, which is not true. We just don't want to deal with the customers that don't even know their own address and send bogus transfers to our partner allday. Who then has to tell the customer we misinformed them, and then we look like idiots. Terrible customer experience."
bad,"This company has the potential of being an excellent company to work for with the exception of working under the managerial prejudisms in the Phoenix, Arizona office(s). Also this company does not offer a retirement package."
bad,"The compensation is good but you are worked like a dog. Often had to take work home and not compensated for working off the clock. Barely took a break some days, due to the workload and the high expectations.. Co-workers were great but the work environment sucked."
bad,other companies will love to interview you if you have progressive on the resume
bad,"Unreasonable work load "
bad,"A typical day is very busy to an extent that it might be very overwhelming for most.  The training is mostly online and is very rushed, with no room to make mistakes or even ask questions.  This is because you have to have all of the computer based training completed before going off to training for 2 weeks.  If you do not have your claim adjuster license well while your training for the job itself your manager at least the one in WV made new hires study for the claim adjuster license at the same time, which adds pressure.  The training is set up that if you fail certain aspects of the training then you are pretty much done, meaning no job.  This is for the position of ""Claims Adjuster Trainee""  the true title of the job is ""Claims File Owner"".  Which means you will not work in the field for maybe over a year or more, but you will be told all you have to do is 6 months in the office as a File Owner and then you will have the opportunity to go in the field.  This is not true.  Also the workload is not equal to the pay.  My first few weeks there I noticed one of the other newer employees just coming back from sick leave and was overwhelmed with their workload and asked the manager for help and the manager stated the employee just needed to do the work that was assigned.  I was a little shocked that the manager kept assigning work to this employee even though he was off sick.  Not to mention did not give him or get him help to catch up.  The manager kept the pressure up on him.  Something I have noticed is how often the posting for this job is on here in WV.  I know they are growing"
bad,Any job you apply for a progressive they make you start in sales. I originally wanted to be in the customer service  department but was forced into sales.
bad,A usual day would have incoming calls with customers angry about having  their insurance increased or cancelled. Job was very stressful as many customers expected free insurance.
bad,"It’s fairly a good company to work for depending on your supervisor. I had three different supervisors in less than 2 years and some of them can be really hard to deal with who lack training and the abity to handle a team. Customers vary but some are really racists and won’t hesitate to call you names even though you’re on their side!"
bad,"Company invests a good amount in training new employees, however right from the start you are overloaded with work. Anyone who has been there for extended period of time is either burned out or doesn't know what they are doing. There is room for advancement after the 1st year if you arent totally broken from the amount of work. Pay is pretty good, but broken down per hour not so much. New managers have little clue on claim process, and new learning is not encouraged; you are on your own in that regard. Overall a nice starting job but after a year or two move on."
bad,"Would prefer not to review the company, company trains you well but then what is expected is not attainable. Coaching points out every wrong but never tells you what you did correctly. They give you company gifts to celebrate company milestones but pay raises were small and had to work up to 10 hours of overtime to meet living expenses."
bad,learned independent working skills it was a great experience flexable hours.great communication with employes  low pay and i didnt like the time sheet routine
bad,It's not all butterflies & rainbows how you'd think. This job is for people 40+ who just want to pay bills and have a few benefits. THE PAY IS NOT ENOUGH. This job will drain you.
bad,"Not my intentions to talk bad a bout company. Not good fit for me.  Work days were long, unfair practices in regards to handing out claims. One person can be overloaded and the person next to you may not have had a claim in days."
bad,"Started hopeful but quickly found that ""hands-on"" training involves having your customer interactions torn apart with another manager watching!  After my first ""coaching"" by a person totally lacking in people skills, I was a nervous wreck and couldn't do anything right from that time on.  I had just experienced a heartbreaking personal loss and just didn't have the nerves to deal with this whole, weird, cold environment.  I am an experienced, college-educated professional, and this place made me question my ability to do anything.  The only true support I got was from one person in HR, and the Employee Assistance line.  One of THE worst work experiences I've ever had in MY LIFE!  Thanks, but no thanks!  If you don't mind being a number, and watched every second of every day, go for it!!!  Taking time off, calling in sick.... they make it so hard you end up taking dings without intentionally doing anything wrong.  RUN!!!"
bad,"High call volume both inbound and outbound, most people often work during lunch breaks, after hours and on weekends due to amount of overlapping job functions."
bad,"Managerial skills were un professional. Retaliation, no open door, no advancement. Employees were hard working Loyal and Honest people working for people who took them for granted."
bad,A very stressful place to work. Hard to have a work/life balance. Not easy to take days off for sickness or move hours as needed due to emergency. Not very flexible with schedule options.
bad,"i made a mistake, and was unaware of the mistake. the company does not allow for mistake. Training was okay except for it felt like i was back in grade school, and the classroom at times did not feel safe. I went to management and they say one thing to your face and then do another. So i guess all in all i did not have a positive experience. But don't let that stop you, good pay, good benefits, just make sure you paid your city taxes, because it can cost you a job at progressive."
bad,"no work life balance"
bad,"To much focus on metrics and not enough on relationship building with the customer.  I received numerous kudos from customers, much more than my other team members and never received credit for this."
bad,The department I worked for catered to certain people. Everyone was not treated fairly and advancements were given to managements favorites not necessarily to who deserved it.
bad,"Overall Progressive is a decent company to work for.  Except for the fact that they work you like a trained monkey and get onto you about the little stuff.  But they don't pay very well, and the Management for the most part is totally useless.  "
bad,"I worked for Progressive for four years as a Claims adjuster. I started at a time when we were not going to be hiring people to a time of hiring left and right. The problem is, the more tenure you gain at one position and not move forward to a new one, the more they push the load on you as a way to get you to ether move forward or move on. We often joked that hard work is rewarded with more work. "
bad,"After nearly 4 years with this company, favoritism and unfair treatment of employees have forced a harsh work environment with little support.  Management is poorly overseen, and HR has no presence in local offices.  Avoid at all costs -- there is no success to be had here without a complete management overhaul, which is nowhere in sight.  You will be overworked, micromanaged, and miserable."
bad,"Answering and making calls all day"
bad,"The non-management employees are great.  Progressive used to be a great company for employee's in general, but that's changed a lot.  The company is heavily based on reports and numbers, but management doesn't care why the numbers are what they are.  This is very frustrating when employees under obviously different conditions are compared against each other.  Long time employee's have seen the company's change and don't like the feeling of just being a number now.  They are running out the ""people"" people in management that made the company great for people who like to endlessly chase stats."
bad,A good company with pay and benefits but they do not care about their employees management lacked training and training classes needed to be better.
bad,"A productive employee is one that is healthy and happy.  Typical day would consist of 50-60 incoming and outgoing calls per day.  You would need to leave the office to go and complete scene investigations, meet people face to face to discuss or resolve injury, or total loss claims on their property.  You would need to drive anywhere from 50-200 miles per day in a territory that expanded from Lorain County to Lake County.  An automobile accident can be life altering.  I enjoyed helping the people I served in resolving their claims amicably with little or no disruption to their lives."
bad,They became too focused on squeezing every last bit of production out of there reps. They took away the differential pay and expected more job duties.
bad,The amount of work vs the pay is disappointing. You have to move to advance in the company. This is a very stressful job. I loved my coworkers.
bad,"Pay and benefits were great, but trainers and team leads were incredibly condescending and rude. They seemed to want to talk down to you at any given opportunity. One-on-ones never felt constructive and more felt as though they wanted to try to embarrass you in front of your colleagues. The initial training was great, but then the environment does a 180 once they throw you onto the work floor."
bad,"Overall the flexibility was great from working at home and flexible PTO rules. The call type for sales is overall terrible. Repetitive questions that make the customer feel annoyed and the representative feeling dumb. Such as ""Do you want to save money on your insurance?"" or ""Is it important for a company to do ____?"""
bad,"If you're not interested in sales, don't take this job. Sales is a tiny bit of what we do as cs consultants, but its treated by management as the most important. Every team meeting, every coaching session with sup is focused on sales. If you dont meet the numbers, they will continuously threaten to fire you as motivation."
bad,"Management has recently changed, and not for the better."
bad,"Management was great but, not really much incentive to work. Benefits were minimal and were only available to apply for 2 times a year. Personally, do not recommend any to work here."
bad,"This is a bait and switch, pure and simple. They lure you in with the promise of a 45k a year salary, but what they fail to mention is that you will absolutely drown in the workload- you can count on 4-5 new claims per day, on top of being in the phone loop for others' claims and working old claims You are given way more work than one person can handle. The management is like Big Brother, tracking every stat they can, like voicemails, time to return said voicemails, how long you're in available  among other things. My supervisor is always away from his desk and offers little to no help. You WILL work minimum 55 hours a week to even have a hope of not drowning. Take a sick day and you will lay for it dearly. Coworkers make it feel like high school again. Not for people with a family. This job has the potential to make even a responsible person rage-quit due to the ridiculous demands placed on the adjuster. Some customers are decent, while others are illogical and act like entitled children when you explain the process. You will need to be thick-skinned every day. I routinely come in an hour early and leave two or more hours after the end of shift."
bad,"Claim overload coupled with  outdated  technology,  made  keeping up with work flow  very difficult. However  leadership  was supportive to a  point, but the  expectations were a  bit much."
bad,"Diverse atmosphere but management could use some improvement."
bad,"Great job, steady pay."
bad,"They really treat you like a child. Terrible Micromanagement, very strict scripting. Even if you sell policies and meet your metrics, if you don't say their scripting you are reprimanded. Terrible environment."
bad,"Not a great place to work. Managment, as well as their tech, is all about 15 - 20 years behind the curve. They are mired in a deep management structure filled with folks that don't understand IT."
bad,"If you want to go un-noticed, and be forgotten about because you're one of the thousands of other peons then this is perfect. Great for flying under the radar, collecting a paycheck until you lose your mind. You will go through extensive training to become the mindless robot they want you to be. 90% of what you say to customers is a verbatim script. DO NOT RECOMMEND for anyone who is capable of thinking for themselves. Totally recommend for anyone who needs help wiping their own butt, but likes to make money while getting wiped."
bad,"Less fun, more profit driven over time.  Team coffee makers replaced with Kuerig.  Lots of Spin such as associates called consultants.  Perverse definition of ""flexibility"" given when limiting usage of earned time off while simultaneously increasing penalties for any attendance occurrences.  R&R budget going from individual supervisor budgets (given to associates as determined by their team; usually gift cards, food, or Logo laden goods) to large parties and corporate pep rallies.  Newer employees hired at higher rate than existing with no consideration for the veterans."
bad,The company was great to work for initially. A bad manager in the company drove employees away from the company.I think if the manager would have been removed sooner the company would have been great to work for.
bad,I work harder than I would like. I do not like the office environment or the coworkers I have. It is hard to speak with management about concerns. It will eventually get better but the beginning is a lot of non-applicable training.
bad,"Due to rapid growth, work load and expectations are unrealistic without working a 60+ hour work week. No overtime, salary only. Training department is mediocre at best, and again, due to rapid growth, hiring/training became less efficient, therefore more errors were being made from new hires which only resulted in more work for the rest of the employees. HR needs to figure it out and hire quality trainers."
bad,They will continue to add work to your schedule with claims until you can't ever catch up.  Very little expectations are set clear from the beginning
bad,this job I believe is for more advanced health care professional not a new graduate. I don't believe the employers are paid enough for what they do.
bad,"Below industry norm for compensation benefits are about normal for most business'. People are great but opportunities for advancement are rare, Progressive will hire inexperience college grads for claims positions instead of promoting from within."
bad,"This is a basic call center environment. The employees are great, management is hit or miss, and the work/life balance has it's benefits. As for management, it is hit or miss when it comes to great, good, or mediocre. In my tenure, I had 5 managers. 1 was great, 2 were mediocre, and the final 2 were terrible. I found little opportunity for advancement and struggling employee morale. If you are looking for a job, this may be the place for you. If you are seeking a beneficial career, you might find a better place elsewhere."
bad,Too much work for 9 hour days.  Claims adjusters should get paid more than they currently are at Progressive.  Company should allow more inter-departmental transfers.  The only University the company had a relationship with was University of Phoenix!!!?  They should build relations with real universities that other companies will recognize.P
bad,"I have worked at progressive for 3 years and at first I love it. They were flexible with schedules, the calls were not back to back every single day, the benefits were great and the metrics were reasonable.  Now they keep adding new metrics every 6 months or so and they do not increase your pay. I'm sorry but to me more work=more pay is a very simple concept. WE LITERALLY HAVE HUNDREDS of calls in cue everyday with only a few seconds in between because of acw and again no pay increase. Furthermore they have a holistic approach that is not consistent between supervisors. They do try to keep employees happy by giving us little incentives but they used to treat their employees better and care less about money. Now everything is all about money and less about employees and customers. Even really tenured people are tired of the stress we are being put through. Progressive should have been hiring more people awhile ago and they should have gave people better schedules coming in. Their forecasting is way off and is completely irresponsible. My love for progressive has quickly turned to regret, disappointment and hate. I'm going to leave very soon as I suspect many others will also. I'm a reasonable person but I am not a robot."
bad,Co workers are great. On a typical day you can get from 6 to 10 claims a day.
bad,"If your life is going good, and you don’t have emergencies or really small children this job is perfect for you. If you have home stress ( Sick family, dr appointments, etc) or even small children that require unplanned time off then I don’t recommend. My supervisor hated me, and smiled in my face but at the end of the day no one was advocating for me. My sales were way above satisfactory. I exceeding every goal expectation and cared deeply for my customers. I have mixed feeling about this place because the pay was really good ."
bad,"Great Atmosphere"
bad,"The job itself was fine, but what they do not tell you during the interview or until about two weeks in, is that all they care about is sales and you making your goals or get fired."
bad,"You must fit Progressive culture to be successful "
bad,either they like you or they dont. Management will do everything they can to sure that you are not welcomed. Watch your back and do everything correctly
bad,"My first day, I was taken out to lunch and the group that took me complained about the work load and feeling bad for even taking a lunch because it was going to cause them to fall behind. I should have known right then I was making a terrible decision. It was high workloads and if you have any ethics and morals, you'll struggle."
bad,"Great place to spend  1-2 years  getting   claims  experience, but then advance to a more complex job outside of  CCU. "
bad,"Claims representative or adjuster position is always overloaded with work. You follow a micromanaged script, they monitor your key strokes,how many voicemails you got,how long it took to call back,how much time you were available to take 800 number ph calls and management only cares about metrics, although they say they dont but thats why they measure absolutely everything you do. Pay and benefits are okay but you will pay for them in work hours and stress. S. TX management is severely disliked by the entire team and morale is at an all time low."
bad,"I was really excited to work here. They promote that they care about their customers and their employees but I’ve seen none of that. It’s like being back in high school. If you are great as sales, you’re valued higher. However, we can’t all be all things. I was told that great customer service is the priority. Ha! It’s not, it’s sales sales sales! And the environment in the actually call center is so gossipy and cliquish. I can’t wait to get out of here."
bad,"You bounce from meetings to work and repeat. Unless you're willing to go out on a limb and chat, which can lead to management involvement in your life. "
bad,"At the time I was there poor management was dragging down the whole state. There is continuous and constant change going on at the company. While change can be good and necessary, it seemed as though they just wanted to change for the sake of changing. "
bad,The work is very demanding. If you start as a Claims Adjuster you will be a salary employee but will work more than 40 hours a week. There are no other career advancements in Houston other than claims. The bonuses are wonderful. You will received 8-12 % of your salary. This is based off the company's performance.
bad,You are never away from phone. You use your two 15 min breaks to use bathroom! if you run out of break time you better be able to hold it. No time to meet any co workers always on phone non stop.
bad,"The in-house counsel office was poorly managed.  There were people in positions that did not have the experience to be in those positions and didn't know anything about other employees' job duties.  The overall management team were not interested in assisting their employees with training or things such as this."
bad,"I worked in the claims department. Progressive was a great place to work. However, the amount of work that one person is expected to do is outrageous. You are on salary, so there is no overtime pay, and you will have to work over about 4-5 days a week to keep up. You get so many claims at a time that you can not hardly keep up unless you come in early and leave late, which is what I was doing."
bad,"The company is a good company to work for as far as the benefits, work life balance and perks however, the opportunities for advancement are few and far between. It's a good job if you're just starting in the work force and/or looking to earn a fair living. The hardest part of the job and the most trying part of the job is some of the callers can be very ignorant, belligerent and at times down right obnoxious. They know your job better than you do even though they don't work your job or in your field. They call with this sense of entitlement and they are paying customers to which I agree whole heartily and that they deserve the best services that their money is paying for. But the biggest issue with most of, NOT ALL of the callers is that they feel that it gives them the right to talk to you any kind of way and you are forced to sit there and endure it for the sake of their monthly premium payment. You never know what type of caller you're going to get that day and if they are a problem callers you don't know how many of them you will get in a given day. Though you are part of a team of reps at a centralized location you can find yourself being moved to a different manager every year in addition to a different location to go along with that new manager or new structure. It is at many times a very mentally and emotionally draining position if you are in the Call Center. If you are hired in the call center whether it be services, sales or as a blended rep, unless you know someone who can get you into a better position, expect to be in your current role for a while. Degrees mean"
bad,"Work here if you value a decent salary. "
bad,"I concentrated on analyzing case facts and related claim information to determine accurate and appropriate compensations while providing excellent customer service. Negotiated with attorneys, witnesses, police officers and claimants in order to settle various claims outside of court. Most of my responsibility revolved around repair shop relations in three large territories within King County. Supervise customers repair processes at network shops as well as non-network repair facilities in assigned territory."
bad,"Progressive has developed a great team atmosphere, and everyone is willing to help each other. The working schedule is also very flexible. However,  Progressive lacks the training and development programs for higher positions. There are very few opportunities for growth. Management personnel are constantly changing, and human resource fails to inform the regular employees. Progressive was once known to be innovative in the insurance industry, but over the past 5 years Progressive is just following the leaders such as GEICO and State Farm."
bad,"In the interview I was told the average daily claims load was 4-5 where in reality it ended up being closer to 18-20. Completely unmanageable even for the most experienced reps. While you are able to carry over unfinished claims to the next day, you need to call the clients you can't get to and explain to them why you can't be there. Very frustrating experience overall."
bad,"Don't work here if you want to be able to use your brain at work. Literally just back to back calls having the same conversation over and over again. Not a bad company, but compared to the tech call centers I've seen like Apple they are centuries behind. And there are so many pore things they could be doing to help break up the day or make the job more enjoyable. They always seem to be penny pinching because cutting costs helps add to the year end bonus (which is really nice if you can stand to make it through the year), but as a result you end up getting a mundane and boring job with a sub-par work environment. For a company that is number three in it's industry across the nation you would think they would have a bit more to offer."
bad,"The metric based system used for performance is a joke. There are several metrics, but the only one that matters is how many Home or Renter's policy you got sent over for a quote. Especially ridiculous when your job does not entail customer calls as your primary role.  Management is not informative and sends out rude blanket statement emails to all employees on a team instead of facing issues they have with certain employees head on and only with that employee. "
bad,Progressive is not a good company to work for at all. Most of the employees have been there for less than year. The company as a whole is unorganized and nothing is done in a professional manner. The pay is good and the benefits are just ok. You will barely have a personal life.
bad,while to company seems great to work for they lie to you during the interview process about what your actual job will be and the customer service role requires a ton of up selling.
bad,This is an ok company to work for. They are friendly and shows some concern with your employment goals while there. This company offers many different employment positions to take advantage of while there.
bad,"I felt like I was sold on the culture and I was sold on the benefits. I was also sold on the job role and what it entails. However, when I hit the sales floor it was completely Cut Throat and there's a lot more to your role then you're sold on it in the beginning."
bad,"I learned to be the most respectable and able employee with this company.  I changed thru crafts from carrying mail, to training to be a supervisor, and beyond.  I truly did enjoy every minute of it, and sometimes regretting branching out into other professions."
bad,"If working with multiple layers of management and even more process that impede actual work, this is the place for you.  "
bad,"Loved working for Progressive and did so for 13 years. After changes to policies and goals, it became a non-friendly place to work with no regards to employees. No value for long term dedicated staff."
bad,"Although a great work environment, high stress with low salary. I would not recommend a friend."
bad,"I loved this job for the first year and a half but after that everything started going downhill. Management was constantly changing, the call volume was outrageous, additional job responsibilities for no additional pay. I loved working from home but my last sup I was lucky if I spoke with him once a month because he was too ""busy."" I hardly got any feedback about my performance which hurt advancement opportunities. There was no team morale because you don't have a chance to get to know your co workers. Constant turnover. Very disappointing."
bad,The company is a great company to work for but right now I am not looking for a job where I would have to work on the weekends. The training program was a very good program to go through.
bad,"Dress code very relaxed/casual helps to be comfortable while doing roughly 5 jobs in 1, Multi task skills are advanced, thanks to PGR. The hardest part of the job is no work/life balance."
bad,Initially offered the option to work from home. After a year of being employed promised offer not given. Supervisors not experienced which led to overall confusion and misunderstandings. Ambiguous guidelines on attendance and implementation of new procedures. Pay rate issues.
bad,"This place has a very laid back feel to work and they treat you as an adult. BUT the sup's MICROMANAGE i mean MICROMANAGE like a vulture in the sky scouting out prey. "
bad,"Pay is not enough for a person with no partner/second income to live relatively comfortably in Colorado Springs.  Also, cannot count on the amount year to year for gain share.  Other than that, I had a tough time resigning because I had THE BEST supervisor ever in my career.  Smart, articulate, compassionate and a great leader.  As asset to Progressive.  In fact, we have kept in contact.  Aside from that, Progressive could improve its computer systems a bit.  Coworkers for the most part friendly and helpful.  Cafeteria has decent food, prices were a bit high.  Also, for DSR position, perhaps the salary itself could be stated as ""salary with no commission"", and have a higher pay.  No commissions is fine, and understandable for maintaining the customer experience, but since sales help drive the bottom line, feel it may need to be reviewed.  So basically it's a mix, but I am applying to other positions because of my experience at Progressive."
bad,"Progressive is a high stress job that compensates you for your work. You get great benefits, paid time off, and bonuses at the end of the year. Just know you can take a risk with the stress."
bad,I loved working for progressive and would have never left. My manager was a very manipulative person who made sure that instead of showing and helping me succeed set me up to fail. I have letters written by other employees stating how much of a miserable places this was when working for her. They went through the same things I did with her. Otherwise it’s an amazing company to work for.
bad,Had a nice day at work nobody bother u I get alone with any and everyone get da trash up in a good time limited like my job and love doing it don't come to work late
bad,"Progressive has an extremely high turnover, like any call center.  They try to disguise it with great culture and fun activities but at the end of the day their main concern is metrics. More recently, the service position has become much more SALES based, however they also disguise this as just another service metric, while their goals for sales are getting higher and higher. They do not realize the stress they put on employees, as a lot of them are struggling to meet their sales goals (in a customer service job.) It began to feel like they don't care if you are helping the customer effectively anymore, but just, ""you could have offered them this."" Rates constantly go up on the customers with not much of an explanation, but the employee is expected to take the hit constantly and tell them it is due to cost of business going up."
bad,"I've applied for over 10 promotional internal jobs. If you are not apart of the click you will not get promoted. When my supervisor decided to interview me I was black balled and was told it was not a promotion but a lateral move. Which I was still not selected. I did enjoy doing my work w/o having anyone looking over my back. The hardest part of my job was being an expert but restricted from advancement. Many of the supervisors have their favorites. For example, they hired 2 people with no type of legal experience. One was a bartender and the other delivered babies prior to being hired by progressive. They were promoted because they were favorites by their supervisor. However, when others applied such as myself, I was told that they wanted experience. When in fact, I have 8 years of legal experience."
bad,"Progressive was an Okay company to work. very relaxed company, a lot freedom. environment is okay. They allow work for from home for some employees. Management is helpful to an extent"
bad,"room for advancement, long hours in most states, micromanagement at it's finest."
bad,"Typical day at work consists of working in multiple programs "
bad,Great company but management in the sales dept aren't helpful when it comes to promotion.
bad,"The people you work with are great!  The compensation is great! However, the vacation days are terrible (you get 5 hours of PTO for every 80 hours you work that's only about 15 days per year)  Management staff could be better. The customers are rude.  The training is okay, in my opinion, my training class was not adequately prepared for the call center floor most either quit or were fired within the first month of full-time work.  The managers are nice, however, if you are hired through a hiring agency the communication between the two companies is erratic at best."
bad,"A typical day in call center is very fast paced and can also slow down at times giving you the option to leave and go home if you have ETB time or Same day is available to you. However I was working in the Mayfield Hts locale which was an hour drive from my home each way and not to mention herds of wildlife running all over the Campus one of which I hit and nothing do they do to make that any easier meaning employees in the winter time on patios feeding them, but anyways the Manager that I had was not diverse at all very judgemental and ignorant to other cultures, never promoted anybody reviews were always negative and quite a few under this person either quit or was terminated and when H.R. was notified nothing was done and  they dont give exit interviews and I was hired in for a position that I didnt originally apply for. Overrall my experience with Progressive was not a great one until the very end when I was switched to another Supervisor and team however at that time of which was too late was already on final from former supervisor for bogus write ups including tardies that shouldnt have counted against me. I would not refer working for this outfit if you are looking for advancement. I did enjoy the scheduling options and museum like atmosphere."
bad,"If you are about the call center cubicle life, THIS IS THE JOB FOR YOU. Out of all my call center jobs this was the best pay wise, environment wise and perks wise. But it wasn’t for me. Majority of the customers are angry, you are extremely busy all day, and you can never interact with your coworkers. They are on you DAILY about upselling, & call metrics and it’s beyond stressful. It turned me off from call centers FOR LIFE!! Never again, that pay wasn’t worth the stress! Health is wealth!"
bad,I would say working at progressive gives a good experience with someone who has little knowledge about car insurance. but lack of communication when new things are updating in each state or something changes in the system that progressive doesn't like.
bad,By working at Progressive I've learned that I can accomplish anything that I put my mind to whether it's obtaining a license for Property and Casualty insurance or anything else
bad,The management and the human resource department made this job unbearable. They work together to ostracize you out of a promotion or a position to give it to a chosen source of their own. It is really sad to know that this still occurs within employers.
bad,"I've worked for Progressive for almost two years. I had hoped by now to get a better schedule which I've gotten denied for each and every schedule request I have submitted. There are some amazing managers here, however after being put on a different team my newest manager is horrible. Call volume can be insanely crazy and stressful but I guess that is a typical call center environment. There are advancement opportunities available but not many. The annual raises are in extremely small increments. Medical insurance provided comes with really high deductibles."
bad,Progressive is a great place to work for someone just starting their sales career. When i was offered my first promotion with progressive it was mad very clear it was not going to be a good fit.
good,"I didn't work there long due to a sudden relocation, but got a great start to my career. I quickly learned a lot about the insurance industry through their intense training program."
good,the managment is not good at all...the benefits are no good and pay is really bad.
good,Stressful can be fast pace. There is always something new to learn. Nice cafeteria and parking . Haven't worked there in years and I'm sure nothing is the same
good,Huge work load. Treated like a child. No flexibility with schedules. Managers micro manage your every move rushing you to complete tasks that you are not able to due to the drivers refusing to speak to an adjuster.
good,The workplace culture is challenging and demanding. There is a constant pressure to meet constant changing efficiency criteria. I learned how to consistently excel and what to pursue in terms of workplace environment with future career choices.
good,"I learned more about the insurance industry while working there to know, its not a career, just putting up with cranky and lazy  customers."
good,Became a # not a person .work load was very hard to manage. Many extra hours to complete the days work .your job is always on the line and was always fearful of losing it
good,"Not a good place to work if you have a family:"
good,they preach work/life balance  but not  attainable when they cant keep employees and the ones that stay work ungodly hours just to stay afloat. major differences in managerial perspective and the ability to close claims.
good,"dealing with 100 degree weather with lost of trash. trucks never had ac, and severely understaffed. if anything i learned that other jobs could only be easier. for someone that was only 18 i had to deal with a lot of middle aged men and their personal problems at home cause with the hours given to use they were hardly home. the hardest part was waking up the next day and realized you only had 5 hours of sleep and your bones ached. only thing to enjoy here was radio chatter, they soon took that away."
good,"Job required allot of travel requiring proper planning to achieve time lines set by the company. Standard set same for all field reps despite miles traveled."
good,The company is out to squeeze every last drop of blood out of you before it sends you to the curb. There are no advancement opportunities and the management has been around for 20 years and have been placed into positions where they have no idea what they are talking about.
good,I loved most of my co-workers. Management only helped some advance and not others. I have managers that had no idea how salvage processing works and yet they were QA my work and they were proven wrong on most reviews.  They were more interested in quantity and not quality. Many of the reps were under trained also and sent us the wrong paperwork to complete our tasks. Yet I had to go through years of claims training and in the end they (management) did even know feature recognition. They set us up to fail. In the beginning of my 25 years I loved the fact that they had INTEGRITY and lived by the Core Values but that was not the was it was the last 5 years. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers and team mates.
good,"Progressive is your typical call center environment."
good,"Fast pace, every day, work load is extremely excessive for the work day, management is no good, you are expected to finish your work in a timely manner without delays although there is not enough time to do so with the work load you are given."
good,Progressive WAS an excellent place to work. Unfortunately they have lost their way with some of their management team. It's becoming a culture of who you know rather than what you can do. People are not leaving Progressive they are leaving their managers that play favorites and only teach you how to go with the flow.
good,The company is to regulated by policy and not enough allowance for situations. My phone had glitches causing RONAs which caused my termination regardless of my stellar performance in all other aspects.
good,"We work on what is need for the day. We get to deal sometimes with costumers that come to the shop and look at the progress they vehicle is doing. Then we work on what's require for the next day. An employee does come to work, we have to cover."
good,"Guided customer through the data received to help them understand what was gathered. "
good,"As a new hire the process to obtain my license was great the ""OJT"" was awful. No consideration was given for a new employee experiencing a major death in immediate family."
good,"resolved complex claims issues, such as liability decision, policy limits, rental cars."
good,Progressive is not worried about how well you service their customers. They only care about meeting sales goals which are not told to you until your well within the job
good,"The pay was decent,but that is about the only good thing about this company.  No room for advancement.  Your direct supervisor will have probably been there 15 plus years before they were promoted.  Most "" Promotions are just lateral moves that pay the same you just take calls from different types of customers."
good,"- terrible work life balance, I worked roughly 50+ hours a week (even some weekends) just to keep my head above water even though I kept my workload fairly low"
good,Unreasonable work load. Poor Management in most areas.  No time off available and very stressful position.  Also new hires were making $2-$4 more per hour and they did not bump the pay of the veterans.
good,"not recommended not good work environment. too much training, not enough customer care too much overview by managers. they have more managers training and coaching than working with customers"
good,"A typical day includes taking 80-120 incoming phone calls. Managers wont answer questions about future, they say to just focus on your current role. Call center."
good,"Worked there for almost a year,  I got sick and they fired me. I found out i had a Heart Problem and had a ton of doctors appointments and physical therapy.  They said they Could not accommodate my days off i needed to go to appointments so they let me go.   Very lazy management as well.   You can be 200 calls deep with people on hold and not a single manager will sign on and take some calls.  Very hard to want to work hard when your drowning in calls and you look over at your managers all having fun and joking and not caring at all about the business (this was not a one time thing).  Should be lead by example and its not."
good,I agree with a previus commnet that if you are in for the money is good however goals are unrealistic (I did achieve all goals but at the cost of going against my personal opinion what customer service is).
good,"The company is an overall great African American agency to work for, however they have clicks and if you're not in the ""in"" crowd you can forget about getting an advanced position."
good,"Regulated heavily by the federal and state governments, so the amount of knowledge one needs to do the job is vast.  However, Progressive's pay rate does not match.  Once hired, which is in itself a lengthy process, the training is sixteen weeks.  This is not job training, it is training to pass the state exam.  For most, it takes two or three times to pass it, even after the training and reading of all three books.  Then the candidate goes through more weeks of on the job training by taking calls.  In my opinion, such stiff requirements should exact an equivalent pay rate.  After taxes, most cannot effectively live on the pay at Progressive, unless they are married, have a roommate, etc.  Also, the computer systems are quite old and frequently interfere with daily activities.  Also, several different systems are in use.  Training is provided for each, but there needs to be one or two so human error is not exacerbated by inputting the same information in several different systems."
good,It was a great starting point in my life but nothing else after that.  They just use people and pay them pennies until they either get burned out or quit.
good,"This job has great potential for promotion any good pay but, it is extremely stressful and you are constantly expected to work overtime and get no support beyond initial training. On top of this no-one in management is in agreement. On day I was a great rep getting honors the next i suck and needed to dtep it up. Unless you are completely dedicated to only this job don't bother."
good,As an employee here you are mostly by yourself with clients.  It may vary depending on whom  you are assigned to care for. It is always enjoyable to help others but it may become difficult when you need  immediate help. You do not get to meet management you speak to them on phones.
good,"I'm not into extended complaining, its just not a very good company, its not horrible and if you are a brown nose you will get along just fine or if you enjoy working unpaid overtime."
good,"If you're use to being mobile, this may not be the best option. great benefits, but confined to a cubicle and ""chained"" to a phone for countless hours."
good,"coworkers are outstanding but management lets them down, work and life balance could be better, no job security whatsoever, culture is not bad and compensation is ok"
good,"You were expected to perform your job quickly, training was limited and minimal.  They overworked employees and if you had poor time management skills you were destined to fail."
good,"Cons; "
good,"What I liked about progressive was having the ability to take your break whenever you wanted, the problem that creates though is the high call volume, it is literally back to back all day, the systems crash often, you get people irate about their insurance policy increasing, you rarely ever see your manager, and you spend every day arguing with customers about their rates."
good,"After 17 years with the company, I decided that I had enough of Corporate bs and micro management and decided to go see what else is out there."
good,"handling  high volume low limit policy, fast pace.  Do not reward hard working individuals.  Do no under stand  the term diversity."
good,"A typical work day consists of multi-tasking and incorporating outstanding customer service skills with administrative duties. "
good,"The learning opportunities are tremendous and available for the willing and able. Work load and life demands make all of the tremendous learning opportunities (i.e. leadership, management prep tutorials, executive library access, etc...) more than difficult to utilize."
good,"Call center insurance sales, servicing incoming auto and home insurance inquiries and sales. Educate on insurance offerings and provide documents to clients and banks"
good,"They place the wrong individuals in management positions. The company is not fair, human resources does not investigate into issues properly. That company does care about there employees, its a lie."
good,"When everything is going great it is ok, but I'd something tragic happens your still treated as if you're an awful employee vs taking what's going on in consideration."
good,"It’s a job. I was a claims rep and had around 11-14 claims per day. You work the claim, talk to stupid people, make a decision and then move on to the next. The next day, you do the same thing and over and over. They are strict about attendance and don’t care if your father has a heart attack that day and is on his death bed....Unexcused absence & if you don’t  have a get out of jail free card...ur fired. The claims reps are broken up into teams and assigned a supervisor each. Some supervisors have their way of doing things and can make your job much harder by making you do unnecessary things on the claim that are pointless. Other supervisors are good, have the “work smarter not harder” mentality. There is room for advancement but get in line, there are so many people ahead of you in line to get those positions and Progressive is all about tenure. It’s a burnout call center job but it’s stable and pays mediocre if you’re cool with that."
good,As a consultant you are the Frontline of the company. The task is easy if you use your resources. However although you hired to service auto you are required to meet 6.3% a month offering rental and homeowner insurance to get a qoute. No quote equal no job in the long run. You can be servicing the customer accurately but if they don't get a quote you fail the call.
good,Progressive tries it’s hardest to seem like it has a millennial based start up culture although the company does not value culture at all. They care more about their stats and numbers than their employees.
good,Progressive was a good place to work. They always had functions during and after work to support company initiatives. They consistently offered new ways to support selling insurance.
good,"If you are used to fast paced call centers, then this is for you. I didn't really know what to expect when offered the job other than helping people that were involved in a car accident. After being there for about a month in, I realized that I signed up to work for a call center... ( which isn't bad if you are good with multi tasking and being on the phone ALL DAY)! "
good,Progressives training process is thorough and educational. The work life balance is awful and the scheduling options are awful for working parents. No work/life balance or flexibility.
good,"Any position in claims depends on your direct leadership. Like in most places, there are great leaders as well as bad ones. It is easy to transfer positions if you are willing to move in case you get stuck in a branch with bad management."
good,"I worked with a great group of people and was satisfied with starting pay but pay increases were not great even with an outstanding review. The company does have resources to help employees with "
good,"The hours and platform for autonomy were great. Company has a department bully who makes for a very unpleasant experience for all. Management is inactively aware and seeks vengeful retaliation on those who oppose. This makes for quite a hostile work environment for all, yet out of fear, no one would speak up. The overall company seemed great, with great benefits but the culture in that one department spoiled my opinion. This was also a position that could be worked from home. That should be highly considered. It would drive performance and minimize very low department morale."
good,"The company is under a new president.  It is currently transitioning, hopefully, for the better.  There is still quite a bit of kinks that need to be worked out in regards to management/employee relations."
good,"Very repetitive, has been going more towards a quite strict work environment. You are monitored vertu closely and critically."
good,Flexible schedule.  Insurance package is ok.  Vision plan is excellent.  Very cut throat place to work at.  You always feel like you are being watched.  You are not allowed to think for yourself.
good,"Progressive provided the building blocks for career growth. Easy training development, great customer service skills base. Communication is key at this location, as well as you make your path by learning as much as possible.Management needs to stop favoring individuals. Get additional time off the phones for your sanity"
good,"As a company I liked Progressive. It was the management that drove me out. I wasl P & C licensed in 17 states, qualified to sell homeowners insurance and kept both retention numbers and sales quotas high, but the money was not forthcoming. Upon my resignation it was if I didn't even exist. No exit interview, had to fight for awarded benefits not even so much as a ""good-bye"" after 8 years."
good,"Progressive has helped me learn the insurance business. I have learned alot about how the claims side of insurance works. I learned Michigan law as far as handling of auto claims. I also learned how to estimate the damages to an automobile after an accident. The most enjoyable part of the job is being out on the road ,working on my own, and going to peoples houses and shops estimating damages to vehicles. It gives me alot of pleasure being able to help someone that is in a difficult situation and making their life alittle easier by taking the time to listen. The hardest part of the job is trying to balance the work load so that everyone is happy . My co-workers are great. We work as team and help each other out when ever we can."
good,"Some people are great  and really care about doing a good job, others are controlling and lack the ability to trust their teams to do the right thing."
good,"Very strict sales quotas, and little to no support if you have trouble meeting those quotas. Often times a policy will be buil and a price offered to a customer, who agrees to it. When their credit is run, the price jumps up and you have to continue selling it to them."
good,It is a nice company overall. Schedules change frequently and that makes it hard for a work/life balance. They do have favorites and those who are favored will see a lot of advancement. Those who are not favored with be be provided limited growth potential.
good,Horrible Horrible Horrible !  They will overwork you until you cannot take it anymore.  There is no reprieve or options for the claims reps when they get overwhelmed.
good,"Progressive is interesting with a relatively wide customer base."
good,The metrix and goals are untangible.  without meeting those goals it is impossible to move forward.  Lots of work rewards have been removed moral is low.  No overtime and the pay is not enough for the verbal abuse from the customers.
good,Business like professional atmosphere as a contractor on site performed the same task every day with increased production quota requiring minimal mistakes.
good,It's a check w/benefits. If you're able & willing to play the game you can succeed. It's very hard to get out of the call center & move to other dept.
good,My department was relegated to a lower pay tier and there were challenges urging our supervisor to advocate for the department in order to receive equitable compensation
good,"Stressful environment,"
good,"Honestly,  progressive is a really great company...someone up high just needs to open their eyes and do some house keeping.  "
good,This is a job where you will either sink or swim. You are provided paid training but the training is not really good. You will basically get thrown to the wolves and you will have to figure it all out. It does have some great people that work that but this job is very confusing and I do not like the idea of working every Saturday.
good,"Decent salary and job security. Available calls and tense management keep you for eight hours a day during the slow times. Ten and more hour days are common, especially on the auto side. The illusion is that each person simply has to manage their work load and perform at a high efficiency level. The reality is that claims take time to do correctly, demands have deadlines and the current structure is to work reps to a breaking point rather than hire sufficiently. High stress, cubicles, this job is tough to begin with. Turn-over is very high in spite of the good starting salary. If you can manage to make it a few years there are opportunities for advancement along the way. But I wouldn't wish this job on anyone that I cared for. Too much stress, too many hours, and then the customers..."
good,Being an adjuster was great the work load was over baring and when i finally was able to keep up i was let go for job performance under a performance improvement plan i was on. Although i had improved dramatically they let me go because of minor issues with closing exposures and a minor coverage clearance that did ultimately get resolved before a vehicle went into repairs.
good,I had a great start but was shuffled around from manager to manager. This was not to my benefit because they all required different things. IIt was a very political environment when it is time for promotion. mgmt pretends to listen but they fail to ensure that change lasts....
good,Management doesn't communicate well. When they do want to talk it's through email only which makes it hard to become personable with your manager. The job doesn't allow for much problem solving which hurts the customer experience.
good,Although their gain share program is unmatchable you can not balance a work and home life at Progressive. It is a very demanding position. I love their culture and hate to be quitting but there isn’t enough flexibility.
good,Work good don't mess with nobody get my job done pick up trash good don't make a mess in da road don't come to work late we and all the workers get alone goof
good,"Competitive pay"
good,"For a big company they try to equally invest in their employees. There's a lot of bad managers, a new bred of cut throat managers trying to get ahead. But there is room for mobility."
good,Progressive is a very good workplace for those who dont see advancement in career. Management most of the time is not aware of the product and technically very ill knowledge.
good,If you work very hard you'll be able to move up in the company within a few years to a position where you will be even under more stress and have no life at all.
good,"They fire those with disability's, late once and you're fired without warning. poor training, no job advancement.aefg wiahg kquehfoipuqewu oweuahpouf hqewpoithwepouh g[ouaehpigaeh [owdo[klrgth spe;rgt wrty wrt5 wrty"
good,"Work is divided among employees so it is impossible to follow a case from beginning to end. Strict, unreasonable expectations; little to no supervision or support from management."
good,Inbound intake sales environment. Plenty of metrics to hit but all in your control which makes things fairly simple.  Year end profit sharing is a plus but also never guaranteed
good,"The job itself was easy is the management that made it difficult. They super micro mange and have no sympathy, empathy, or compassion for their employes."
good,"The nature of being a claims adjuster is staying very busy. I loved that there was always something different and learned new things almost every day. It would get very overwhelming in the Summer and also if you take time off.  I often worked through lunch, stayed late, and came in on weekends to attempt to catch up.  With this happening, I was never able to get a good grip on auto claims and balancing my personal life. The team environment was great but I felt I could've got better support from the overall management.  I compare it to previous companies I've worked for when I didn't get the hang of the claims until a good year into it and had tremendous support from management and long time workers. That being said, my team at Progressive was always new and it was hard to get tips from others who have only a few more years than you in that position. Auto claims was just not for me. The benefits were great and the compensation was reasonable."
good,"Progressive is a rapidly growing, and profitable company, but churns through employees partly due to inept management in Oklahoma and lack of any cross development. Targeted selection interviews for every position as you advance in the company, so you need to develop great stories about your work product."
good,There is potential and pieces may be in place for true change if there were a higher amount of those with the right motives in positions of authority.
good,"Management is very disconnected from the staff. They do not realize the impact of their actions on productivity and morale, and if they do.. they just don't care. Loved my co-workers, hated the management, the redundant tasks and overwhelming workload."
good,"This place has plusses but more minuses.  Yes you will learn about insurance. You'll make some decent money with work from home options. More than half of the front line folks work from a home office. Health center cafeteria & gym are all nice but after that it alot of work.  Theyll preach to you about advancement opportunities but they only come up infrequently & they dont let you know you'll be competing with upwards of 100 people nationwide for 1 avail spot. They're more concerned about the interview process instead of the person as everything is done via Skype or virtually so you never except for the initial interview meet with an actual person.  Turnover rate more than 30% for new hires which means 3-400 people in 2 yrs have walked.  They have a set job lineup for you that they want you to follow as to what you're next spot should be after cust svc but if that's not for you you're stuck answering 60-80 calls per day with 5 secs in between from people who dont have any personal responsibility or knowledge of insurance.  You're always delivering bad news to them about state forms not being turned in or discounts falling off it's very tough.  Theres a 30k page online encyclopedia that you have to use for every call cause every state differs in their rules.  Workload is very intense, stress & anxiety you will take with you day by day.  Good amount of schedule flexibility though in terms of sliding hours and using accruing vac time whenever you want in a self schedule process.  Its not for everyone.  Voted best place to work in Austin but did they ask the right people?. Def"
good,"To each its own , it's good for some where it's horrible for others and the chance to apply in other departments can be taxing.  Be sure that you are going into the position that you have applied for."
good,see resume good place to work time for me to move on.looking for a place to grow and show skills more to learn in field.I love what I do for a living and making people happy.
good,I had a good experience at Progressive.  the biggest problem is that Progressive has to agree with whatever DYRS wants weather right or wrong.  The Regional Director doe snot provide support for his employees he goes along with whatever DYRS needs and wants.
good,"Unrealistic expectations. Adjusters and MRR's are worked to death. Class action suit over lack of overtime pay and ridiculous hours. Mgmt completely out of touch with reality for the most part. Progressive is a good company with a good culture if you live near their corporate centers, Ohio, Florida, Arizona....."
good,I used to think Progressive would be where I would work for the rest of my life however recent management changes led to a serious decline in work/life balance.
good,"I LOVED the company and was released based on their assessment of my attendance. Five years I spent with Progressive, praising their humanity and progressive philosophy. I would purchase Progressive apparel for my mother and other family. In July, they placed me on an attendance warning. The warning indicated two more tiers before termination, if my attendance did not improve. The points do not role off until one year has passed. My termination was the last week of October, because they discovered a report following my July warning that allowed them to increase my attendance points. I used too much vacation hours for parts of my shift and the setback went unnoticed. By the time, my manager noticed, I had another occurrence, instead of giving me my second warning or even a final warning, they chose just to add four points to my attendance and fire me. My metrics were good and few people would embrace the Progressive culture like me. People with less enthusiasm for the well being of the company and its clients fired me."
good,"Agist culture with constantly rotating bosses who can not properly evaluate or guide employees. Younger staff were constantly rude to older, more experienced superiors."
good,"Progressive is, overall, a good place to work as far as benefits. The culture is good. However, it's not the greatest place to work in regard to work/life balance for single parents though."
good,Typical call center environment.  Very liberal culture.  LGBT postings everywhere.  Management communication was limited.  You feel attached to your cubicle.
good,The company keeps growing but they are not adding the personal to keep up with the demand. Instead management keeps asking more of their associates that are already working long hours.
good,"Workplace is okay, but difficult work/life balance. Stressful environment. Typical day at work includes excessive daily followups with customers and other vendors."
good,"I absolutely loved the people I worked with, however as an employee you are simply a number to management. I would come in an check voicemails and emails. And then start working on claims. If it's not a crazy day you can take lunch, but most people eat at their desk.  I tried to wrap up on time, but usually ended up staying about 30-45 minutes after the ""end"" of my shift to try and stay on top of the inventory.  In the summers you will be working 6 days a week and likely 60 plus hours.  A lot of coworkers take their computers home and continue to work in the evenings. They started hiring more adjusters about 6 months after I came on and the workload wasn't too crazy when I left, but my first year was insanity in terms of the amount of work we were given to do. People were dropping off left and right and then we were slapped on the wrist for poor performance.  I became better at the job when the workload lightened, but didn't have a very good supervisor and I never felt like anything more than a statistic to our office manager."
good,"It is an average place to work.  I enjoyed my co-workers and some of the benefits provided by management.  However, the demand on time management and overall work production was at times unrealistic."
good,Great company to work for.  I have learned a lot about insurance while being employed with the company.  The experiences that I have had have all been wonderful.
good,Too many cliques and too much nepotism.  It might be a good place for 1st time employment or a recent college graduate. Otherwise the pay scale and advancement opportunities are not really there.
good,Management sticks together and does not take your concerns seriously. If your supervisor is not helpful/ knowledgeable; you are still written up for not meeting certain criteria even if you show proof that you reached out for help and did not receive it. Disciplinary actions are unfair and not the same across the board. Supervisors and upper management show favoritism to representatives (one rep will get disciplined while another representative may not get disciplined for the exact same action). Hardest part of the job was lack of support from upper management and not being heard when you voice your concerns. Being retaliated against for speaking up. The most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers outside of upper management.
good,"This place will keep you in the same position for 3 years before they even think of advancing you.  If you want to move up, be prepared to do added on work at the same pay"
good,"I was only there for about a year and found it difficult to find available positions within the direct department that I was a temp/contractor in.  I applied to some Customer Service Reps position, but didn't want to be forced in that area.  I also applied for a position in their Salvage department that was nearby and similar to what I was currently doing, but their interview process was extremely strict and rigid.  It was hard to get a ""feel"" of what management wanted directly.  Overall, I think it's a great company to work for, I just wished there was more options/communication in how to get into there."
good,is a great company to work for if you don't have small children and are available to work any shift. the team over all is very patient and understanding
good,"As an Administrative Assistant, I have the joys of opening new referrals for both Arbitration and Litigation. A typical day for me includes opening new referrals, completing tasks for my assigned attorneys, scanning and processing legal documents and correspondence - including, but not limited to: motions, summons and complaints, answers, notice of trial, inc."
good,"Very stressful as we were micro managed. Very clickish, if you made a mistake no support from management. You were written up or terminated. Excellent benefits but not worth the stress"
good,The position as Claims Adjuster is a great job and I really enjoyed helping others during such a stressful time. However the management was not as good as it could have been.
good,Great Company! Local leadership lacks serious motivation ability. Leadership does not support tor encourage upward mobility within the state.
good,"Progressive is a wonderful company overall, with amazing senior leaders who are approachable. It is true that the organization is run as a meritocracy. I was fortunate to have worked in a variety of positions within my employment of 12 plus years. Company objectives stretch your limits and challenge your problem solving abilities. "
good,"long days"
good,"They have available work here and there, So you are basically always waiting around for work. I would not recommend this company to no one. sorry"
good,"Typical day at progressive was normal, we have to call in and out to receive our hours for the day. The employees we dealt with were some times rude and often gave incorrect information, at some points that was the hardest part of my day dealing with the employees and my greatest part was knowing i successfully finish my work as a care giver and my client was still alive. Often times i would ask for management but they weren't to understanding of the situation."
good,The work environment seemed tense and times. We seemed to be generally understaffed. there were good benefits and competitive wages. My expectations were a lot different from when I started working and from when I ended my employment. I feel that there weren't many incentives to make employees want to work harder. Very numbers driven. Not enough opportunities for advancement.
good,"Overall this is a good place to work. However this review is specific to the medical claims department in PA. They say they care about you , but they are just pretending. Its about growing the company while overloading you with work to keep cost down in hiring more people to balance the work load.  Ive witnessed management treating older people with blatant disrespect. Its evident that this office has preferences. "
good,"Working at Progressive taught me how to work with all different kinds of customers, I dealt with our customers at the most difficult time after being involved in a car accident."
good,A typical day of work will consist of assisting customer on a day to day basis. working with my co-workers and customers will be my most enjoyable part of the day.
good,"It takes 10-15 years to make it into a Supervisory position and even then, the compensation is NOT competitive"
good,"The best parts about working at Progressive were the co-workers and the health insurance offered. I've met some really amazing people there who will be life long friends."
good,"As a customer preservation specialist, a typical day included taking inbound calls in a call center. The calls were a mix up of customers wanting to cancel their policies, or not happy with their rates, customers who needed to make changes on policies, rewriting previously canceled policies, and cross-selling new products, and assisting customers who were moving out of state"
good,The coordinators are friendly and flexible. The pay is low and they don't orovide many incentives.
good,"Wonderful place to work, but the holistic approach to management gives too much of an option for certain members of management to usen as aplatform for favortism, and discrimination..."
good,"- Lot of gossip"
good,"At typical day would included adjusting medical claims which would include confirming injuries and medical treatment, ruling out fraudulant factors, reviewing medical bills for medical necessity and payment. Also there is a customer service aspect with answering phones and helping customer on claims."
good,"Progressive was a very good job in respect to the opportunity of advancement, on the job training and paid training. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing and casual which makes for a nice day at work. The down slide for me was the inability to easily put in for a scheduled day off. If your child(ren) get sick and you have to take an unplanned occurrence, the punishment was harsh. Management seemed to be more discouraging than encouraging. It was definitely not a terrible job by any means, but just not so easy for a parent who may be looking for a ""family-friendly"" workplace."
good,Great people to work with. Freedom to run your own business.
good,Almost all peers and co workers would go out of their ways to help assist all new representatives. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. Peers were encouraged to ask other peers for assistance before asking Supervisors.
good,Would not like to leave a review at this time. I only worked here for a couple of months and decided it was not the best fit for me or for the career goals that I am aspiring to.
good,"The end of year bonuses, and monthly seminars, many clubs surrounding multiple cultures. Management is hit or miss, some supervisors care about your well-being while others don't. No work/life balance, or sick days. Take a while to accumulate PTO hours."
good,"During my initial interview I specifically asked the hiring manager if up selling was required or if there was anything having to do with sales for the position. Hiring manager flat out lied to me and told me no. In fact that is the part of the job that is focused on by management the most. They want you to try to get customers to get a quote for renters/homeowners insurance. It is a primary metric by which they measure performance. It effects raises and you must have at least a certain percentage of ""takes"". To me, if my job performance is based off of my ability to convince a person to get something, even if if it's just a quote, that's sales. If you don't mind sales it's not a bad job. But management is incredibly misleading and even constantly try to brainwash you by telling you that you aren't in fact doing sales. The company culture is also very oriented to butt kissing and congratulating people you have never met on random nonsense to prove that you are a ""team player"". My advice, go in assuming that everything they tell you is a lie. If you don't, you will be very disappointed. Very cult like constantly telling you how wonderful they are. But, the pay wasn't bad and my actual coworkers were cool."
good,It was okay except for the aspect of call center pay vs. the pay that a licensed agent is paid out of a Progressive office............................
good,The time spent there was helpful in furthering my career. The fast paced CCU team was all about speed and getting claims paid and closed in 2 weeks. Typical workload was 10-14 claims per day.
good,"Progressive is a great company to work for if you are new to the corporate realm and enjoy the ""come as you are"" culture. There is little to no dress code - and the more odd/different/authentic you are, the better your chances are at getting hired here. You will mainly be hired at an entry level position and stuck to the phones before you are able to move your way around within the company. They do have a high WFH agent base, which is great, but with that you are so far removed from anything it tends to get depressing and hard to switch to anything else besides a call center environment. It seems the only way to move up here is to be stationed at one of their main head offices. There is also a high turnover due to the call center vibe not being for everyone long term."
good,"Things change on a regular basis, you rarely have the same supervisor for more than a year, the workplace is relaxed when it comes to attire, and I work from home so there’s not much communication with other people except for on the computer ."
good,"I thought Progressive did a fantastic job of making you feel welcome, supported, and included in their company culture right from day one. I was so excited to start working there. Everything was going great for the first few weeks. The training was a bit watered down, but it seemed necessary given the way everyone is onboarded and how they need to groom you into the role. However, it very quickly descended into a living nightmare. By the 4th month of working there, I was completely burnt out. Working 14 hours a day and on the weekends, just to stay afloat, was not something I ever intended on having to do. I took the job expecting to put in some extra time, but this was absurd. Just picking up the phone became painful as people mainly call you to scream and complain about something. The days were incredibly long and stressful as every person you interact with wants something done for them immediately, including your own manager. The only real support you can get there is to literally have someone else doing your work. If you aren't able to touch a claim, it just sits there collecting dust until you log on late at night to look at it again. The only helpful support I received was really from my peers (who were AMAZING) that would reach out to check in on me from time to time. The managers were lifeless. Glassy-eyed zombies droning on about creating efficiencies and working harder. You could tell they viewed people simply as a commodity to churn through more claims. The only real advice I ever got from them was to ""focus on your new claims"", which in turn helped to effectively"
good,"Total luck of the draw with management there.  Has good amenities, paths for advancement and the facilities can be good.  Lots of brand new equipment or super old equipment."
good,"Work load is never ending. Busy from the time you walk in until the time you walk out. Must have great customer service, time management and organization skills to be successful."
good,"The call volume is much higher than presented when interviewed.  The company has an ever growing and changing environment, which is good and offers many opportunities for growth.  However, with the changes some positions received increased work responsibilities with no added compensation, which was initially how the changes were originally presented."
good,Not very professional work place way too many unnecessary rules. Mostly worked with little help or supervision. Location was very convenient good parking. Just bad supervision.
good,A typical day at work was arriving early and staying late. I did learn a great deal though about managing people and differing situations. They provided very good in - house training.
good,The job gets so repetitive! It’s hard to maintain motivation when every single call is the same. Some managers are unbelievably awesome but some have power control problems. I learned so much about personal lines but once your in a department then that’s all you learn. :(
good,"I was a CLRU Rep and we were pretty much constantly busy. I was on the phone for 8+ hours a day and it’s a lot. All of your phone calls are monitored which is fine but the supervisors will pull them and make you listen to them so you can learn what not to do anymore. It can be really uncomfortable and awkward, a lot of high pressure situations where customers are screaming at you over the phone. I was paid very well and had all the benefits you could want pretty much even accrued time off per week which was nice. The company itself really is a great company, it just was not a fit for me. If you don’t mind being on the phone and are able to keep your cool with people yelling at you or having to take a claim where someone’s wife, husband, daughter, or son has just died, then you might really enjoy it."
good,"It's a large corporate culture able to spend money to facilitate ideas and give back to its communities.  Their art collection in the main campus is stunning!  Their employee resource groups for LGBT and minority employees are very active."
good,If your someone who wants to dedicate there life to one company in exchange for money then this is the place for you. You will end up working 12 hours a day. Doing leftover work on weekends and have no fun but in 5-10 years you will probably be making around 200k. Horrible way to live your life though.
good,The nature of the job is stressful.  There is a lack of consistent management styles from team to team. Employee work performance is not evaluated consistently from manager to manager.  The company is flexible with scheduling.  Salary is average at best. There is a bonus structure in place but the amount are tied to overall company profits.
good,"Progressive at first seemed great. But the longer you are there the more they care about numbers over the person. They make you worry about your numbers no matter what and will fire if you are not up to par. It has a lot of politics in moving up here and when you change jobs inside the company, the training lacks credibility. The pay is okay and the benefits is what has kept me at progressive so long"
good,"Long days. The 10 to 12 hrs a day shifts got the same amount of break time as an 8 hr shift. Makes those days the longest without enough break time from starring at the screen all day. Wares you out fast. And the scripting the they have, the way you have to talk with customers makes you sound like a robot and not an actual person. Regardless of what their tests say is more effective on the customer."
good,"Great advancement opportunities, good training. The job is very stressful and workload is a lot. Worked with a great group of people. Lots of coaching."
good,"Nice culture heavy workload, no work life balance incentives, management was horrible and very unapproachable-I would recommend for a person who is goal oriented"
good,"Great work environment but it is very apparant that some employees receive preferential treatment over others. The workload is very high during the summer months but usually calms down afterwards. The more time and energy you put in to your work, the more they expect of you. I do not feel I am adequately compensated."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with.  The toughest part is maintaining a work/life balance.  The workplace culture does include encouragement of ongoing training, education, and job development."
good,Need more schedule options such as part-time. More breaks in between calls in order to maintain great service. Have the opportunity to work from home.
good,"If you are fortunate enough to get to work monday through friday between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. they have a lot of fun activities that they do for their employees, generally on a Tuesday or a Wednesday.  However, if you do not work the standard business hours for a 24 hour call center they do not include you in the majority of their company activities."
good,"Work life balance is not good"
good,Extremely repetitive menial work. Some management has no insight into the difficulty of the job. Many people have the same issues with the stress levels.
good,"the environment can be very fun loving and comfortable but with encouraging employee relationships comes all the drama that relationships of any type can bring into a work environment. favorites are played far too often when it comes to management and resolving issues, handling the day to day tasks or even promotions."
good,Overall a pleasant place to work. Extensive training provided. Supervisors had same amount of knowledge as me after I completed training. Not much opportunity for advancement.
good,"Very numbers based. If your not meeting quota by a certain time, and after a few write ups your gone. The call flow is crazy as well, at times it can get very stressful."
good,"Customer Service Applicants BEWARE!!"
good,"This is a hard review for me to write as I for the most part loved the opportunity to work for this company. It is a very stressful environment because of the tasks that are required in the time frame provided. It is really like you are putting out fires all day and the next day have 4-7 more fires to put out while having to contain smoldering fires from the day before all the while trying to keep your neighborhood safe one claim at a time. "
good,"Great place to work if you like to be stressed and micro-managed, other than that, they have great benefits . They record your calls everyday and then change the metric system frequently. depending on the manager you are assigned to , you will either sink or swim in their call center!"
good,"I work from home now but the call center was clicky and management is not good. They went down hill after losing a good manager to a different department. After that everyone I knew was getting fired and blamed for things they didn't do. Because if it doesn't look good in numbers, what good are you as their robot trained employee? I used to love working here and was so proud. I recently received a verbal warning for an issue I didn't realize was bad. Then they wouldn't consider me to grow out of my position so I'm stuck. Either leave or get fired. It sucks. I thought I'd be with progressive for a long time."
good,"Great pay management needs improvement, not much opportunity to grow. The job culture is not diverse and is not the best one I experience. Great job work/life balance."
good,"Progressive is employing all levels of experience, be prepared to put a year in, all promotion is from within.  Outstanding opportunities for growth and development."
good,"Very fast paced environment. Benefit packages declined more and more with time. More often than not, advancement/promotions were not determined by merit but by who you interacted with socially. Seniority became a thing of the past."
good,"If you like sales and being told that you must meet weekly SALES goals, this might be the job for you.  However, I was told it was a call center where we take calls to help customers with questions and concerns.  NOT SO.  While it is a call center, we are expected to make a SALE on as many calls as possible.  So, if you have an angry customer, you are still supposed to try to upsell them.  That leads to very nasty customers.  As a call center rep, you must allow customers to curse you out, yell, scream and basically treat you with as much disrespect as they can...and, STILL try to get them to purchase another policy.  Very cut throat and the ""coaches"" only treat you well if you make your sales goal each week.  Again, if you like sales and are able to put aside the abuse you receive from angry customers, this may be the job for you.  The pay is good and you will get time off depending upon how many SALES you make.  For me, it was not the job I wanted or thought I was accepting.  You might consider researching the turn over rate...just to get a true picture of what employees think about being fooled into believing this was a call center, rather than a sales center.  Good Luck.  I have moved on!"
good,"A valued employee will go along way to work hard for a company. Even more so, an employee that has done their best to do their job the right way is one that more attention should be paid and not treated as replaceable."
good,Jobs good customers are good but management leaves something to be desired. Hardest part of the job is learning the material but it's car insurance....
good,"With all the hype about open door and challenging things.  Don't do it.  Managers take things personally.  Open door is used to their advantage.  Company used to be a great place, now it is full of bean counters.   Progressive used to be an IT company that sold insurance.  They are now all about processes and paperwork.   Management is marching to a different beat than the employees."
good,"Progressive is a great company filled with great people. They have a decent benefits program and Gainshare is great for anyone who can last long enough to get it. That is about all the good there is about this job. Too much work for any one person. No time for brakes. Many feel like the only way to avoid being buried in work is to come in on days off. Work/Life balance is nonexistent unless you consider 55-60 hour work weeks without lunch brakes work/life balance."
good,"If you are looking to get into insurance, this company will train you very well. "
good,"It's a great place to start your career in the insurance industry. It provides a great basis for beginners. Unfortunately, the pay is below average as compared to other insurance companies and there's not much room for advancement."
good,"After making several policy changes this year, the company has become hard to work for and please. They are not accomodating to pregnant women while on maternity leave. A new attendance policy is very harsh and you can get fired with things that have nothing to do with attendance at all,.. like the wording you use when you call in"
good,Big company with good people. Very hard to grow due to interview process. They do not push you into a new position and if you don't ask you will stay in same position for entire career.
good,"Needs better management and bidders. No 401K co-workers are great. "
good,I worked long hours with not much appreciation for the employees. I enjoyed my co workers but the job itself at that time was very stressful.
good,"Overall the position as a claims adjuster was okay,  the work load is too much for the time frame that is provided and for the pay. The metrics sometimes are to high to be met.  The one thing that kept me there for so long was the co-workers, I enjoyed the people I worked with. I did learn a lot about adjusting claim and doing coverage investigations."
good,"The evolution of customer service is delayed compared to other or similar industries. Low pay, even with an extensive customer service background."
good,"progressive has really good benefits , but when it comes to work life and balance it is very hard to get time off . The pay is pretty good , kind of hard to become a supervisor."
good,"The job was relatively secure, and the co-workers were great.  However, the corporate leadership was not employee-oriented.  There are better options out there."
good,"Very busy all the time work very long hours "
good,A good place to work that consistently strives to be a leader in the industry.
good,"At the call centers you work long days with irregular hours. In exchange for that schedule you receive an excellent benefits package and additional perks like onsite restaurants, gyms, healthcare facilities, art/culture events, etc. It's as if they never want you to leave. The call centers are often improperly staffed leading to either excessively long lulls or extremely high call volume. Room for advancement is plentiful because the company is so large however it might take 3-5 years minimum for someone to move out of the call center."
good,"Great job, great pay. Had the best branch manager until he was promoted and someone else came in and was horrible to work for. I knew him for 4 years and he didn't even know I had a son. Didn't know his employees and didn't care."
good,"•	Managing IT Buying Projects "
good,"As a claims adjuster, you have a workload that never slows. On average, you receive from 4-8 claims per day, without regard to the complexity or time commitment differences in each case. As one manager stated, "" You should always be comfortably behind"". "
good,"The best training"
good,"8 hour days, customer service, a lot of data entry, changes to policies.  I learned about insurance regulations and how they varied from state to state.  Management was good acknowledging hard work and allowed for responsibility for work responsibilities and tasks.  Co-workers all were team players, as it should be working for the same employer, helping one another as needed and providing positive feedback"
good,"Good company, however senior leadership values do not migrate down to the workforce."
good,"Decent pay. Not very reasonable when it comes to ADA Accommodations or if you need a schedule switch due to a family emergency. Bottom line is that if you can fit into their schedules they want you to work: it is great then. If not, get ready for a lot of write ups and attendance issues. "
good,"My mom calls this a sweatshop. It's better for someone starting out in their career. They demand a LOT of time and your position is normally exempt. If you can land a hourly position, grab it!!!!  If you are exempt, they will get their money's worth out of you. Their compensation and benefits are pretty good though. I have heard that they are trying to make it a better work/life balance though and that corporate is a much better work environment. However if you don't work at corporate, it is really all about who is in management because they can make your life hell and work you to death. Lots of people are on anti-depressants and end up with medical problems due to the stress and fatigue of working for Progressive."
good,All work and no time for relationships with co-workers or managers
good,"The Company itself was pretty awesome.  The Job however, was horrible.  The Customer's were rude and you really didn't get a lot of assistance when needed."
good,work from home is the best thing to do. schedules change so that helps and the training is pretty good as well. .............................................
good,"Ok place to work. A lot of calls, and you have to push Renters/ homeowners quotes on people even if their angry, or cannot pay their bill. No matter the situation you have to offer the quote. Company has a quota and if you cannot meet it it is strictly your fault even if you get them transferred for the quote and they don’t finish. This could cost you your job, or schedule. My advice? Try to do well so you can get a position off of the phones. If not start looking for a new job because they will end up letting you go."
good,"Customer service is no longer only helping customers, it includes promoting other products. Leadership and goal changes are constant. When I left the company, they no longer stated that their employees where their strongest asset. I fired a lot of good people because of silly rules but also helped others to promote to other roles. I have mixed feelings about the company...they do have a lot of creative and talented people. To do the Supervisor role right, there is a lot of hours and responsibility. Your guys aren't cold calling just cross selling...give it a shot."
good,"Performance based scheduling takes away from the family/life/work balance. Unless you are performing at 200% of your job's requirement, you'll be assigned a schedule that may not meet your lifestyle."
good,"Great opportunity , very welcoming, very positive. Very little work life balance. Also, very few positive manager but the ones that are available are excellent."
good,They start off my saying that this is a great job that focus on family work life balance. I few weeks later they say your not effeciant and try every which way to get rid of you
good,"The pay is fair and they offer good benefits. Not a lot of work/life balance. Not a lot of opportunities to be involved with or get to know other employees. Not a very personal company - they are a very large corporation and it is a bit impersonal to work there. There is opportunity to advance internally and to be trained within. Overall a good company to work for, but not a good fit for me."
good,Work from home employees have a different kind of negative vibe. It always sounds like they aren’t serious enough when they play a major part in the calls.
good,"After 3 years at Progressive, I was let go without so much as a disciplinary warning or any history of disciplinary action.  For all of the opportunity Progressive provided, the way that was handled has put a black spot on my time there.  They are good at listening to their employees to a certain extent, but there was a huge disconnect between upper management and associates."
good,"Work claims on a daily basis is the expectation for a typical day at the organization. Some days are busier than others, but expect to be busy on a regular basis."
good,"Progressive is a good place work I was contracted so I really don't have too much to say.  I reviewed Pip/Med pay claims, call providers regarding medical bills process within the allotted time frame."
good,It was just an ok place to work.   Very cut throat and supervisors make it seem like they care about you and your progress but they are only trying to get information from you.
good,The company offers options to do many things as you learn the ins and outs. Gainshare is a good bonus end of the year ..Overtime is slim but there.Benefits are ok i have had better. Management could use some re organization. Pay needs to increase based off cost of living. Easy training and good work life balance.
good,"There is a lot to learn, in a fast paced and changing industry. I have the opportunity to set my schedule and make sure my work gets done well.  We are responsible to make sure the customers we serve are treated fairy, with an eye towards retaining a customer or gaining one."
good,Tough management but had lots of work and consistent pay but they defentily want you working if your an employee they also work a lot of overtime decent job
good,"Great place to work, busy and great pay.This company does care about there employees. The only aspect that needs improvement is time off. You have to work for the company for atleast 5 years to get a nice amount time off a month."
good,Progressive is a great company with many great benefits. Scheduling is not very flexible and work life balance is hard to maintain. Pay is pretty good.
good,Loved the schedule i had and my employees were wonder. Pay was great but the job is stressful and management was poor so was the team leads. I was stressed everyday i had to work. So i walked out i couldn't take the stress any longer
good,"Progressive is a good company to work for, the benefits are nice, the dress code is relaxed, but it can be a very stressful job and the workload can be high.  If you have a good supervisor, the office can be very relaxed and fun.  The company is growing quickly, which means more policyholders and more claims.  The summertime is the busy season and it can be almost unbearable, 7+ claims per day. Find a good flow to manage the workload and it won't be too bad, don't get behind otherwise it's hard to dig yourself out."
good,A good company with good employees and managers. Worked 40+ hours a week. I was on the road 3-5 days a week inspecting vehicles and resolving bodily injury claims. Towards the end of my time there I spent more hours in the office handling injury claims than looking at vehicles.
good,"I fell in love with the people and the work at Progressive. However, the quantity of claims being asked to process was greater than the hours in a normal work day.  Therefore I was working well over 50+ hours weekly."
good,Heavy workload. It cannot be completed in most 8 hours days. you have to be willing to work longer a lot of the time. Pay raises only average at best.
good,Incredibly Stressful and Incredibly Long Hours.  Local management understands but can't do enough to make it tolerable for long periods of time. In the end the pay wasn't worth it.
good,"Supervisors not always kept to same standards"
good,"A claims adjuster is not a job for everybody, but Progressive is pretty good about providing opportunities to grow and invests in individual training.  You will be challenged but as long as you're trying to succeed, usually managers will work with you.  The work life balance is not the best, especially if you are managing a difficult circumstance outside of work. Benefits are pretty typical for insurance companies."
good,It's an ok job at best. They are flexible with shift options and have good health insurance. The pay could be a lot better for the level of calls and sales produced.
good,"Great job, not great hours though. Qualifications:"
good,"Overall great people but the claims adjuster role is extremely demanding of time. Expect early mornings and late nights."
good,As a fitness specialist/manager I was given a lot of creative freedom which resulted in revenue-generating programs and increased client sales/retention
good,Huge company with big company problems.  Held several positions within the company and worked out of state for a while.  Learned a lot about auto insurance that has come in handy
good,"It really depends on the field you go into at progressive. In the sales, there are many people going for the next role and be prepared for change every day."
good,"Progressive was a great place for me to launch into a career that I now enjoy. Unfortunately, however, they miss out on quality talent by requiring a bachelors. In order to prove that I was someone that could be promoted, I had to go to another company and move up the ranks. That was the only thing that I didn't like about Progressive. the people and culture was very nice to be in when I was there."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, they do pay below other comparable companies in the area. If you like empathy or compassion for situations out of your control (like illness) then do not work for this company. They say all the right things but they don't actually believe or follow them. Saw multiple promotions based on who one associates with as well."
good,Insurance overall can be a little boring but I remember that the management tried to make it as fun as they could with pot lucks and raffles and fun activities that every one could be involved in.
good,"There are too many activities to explain here, but it is extremely stressful. If you do not exceed immediately you will never get promoted."
good,"Money was ok, very busy and stressful, micromanagement is 24/7 and you have specified times you're allowed to use the bathroom. Most of the direct managers were cool."
good,"The company itself is super nice to work at, however the call center is really stressful. I feel like that if I would have started off in another department I would have never wanted to leave Progressive."
good,"Depends on the day, sometimes you're stuck at the desk on a phone all day taking calls no stop with little opportunity to take breaks. Every minute of your day is tracked on the time sheet so at the end of the day you might be reprimanded for taking a bathroom break or something is your AUX time is over 5 min"
good,"Most people let go are for attendance. There are no excused absences and if you are late it counts as a full absence. The roll off after 12 months. It can be very easy to get behind, they seem very flexible until you have an issue an then it quickly snowballs."
good,"You sit at a small desk, starring at a computer, waiting for the ding to go off on your headset to let you know there is a caller on the line.  You get two :15min breaks, and a :45 min lunch.  They monitor your time off the phone... If you are gone to long for a break, if you spend too much time document a file, if you have to call the help desk, anytime you are not selling, it is being noted.  It affects your review, and your bonus.  Every call is recorded and the screen is captured so they can see what you are looking at while you are on a call.  ie... Facebook, ESPN, etc.  I enjoy talking to people face to face, seeing their expressions.  Only being on the phone, all day every day, is something that I didn't like.  But, that is the job."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at Progressive. Claims is tough. High volume, dealing with constant conflict and anger. Progressive makes a big effort to afford work life balance and it was a fun office. Just difficult to manage high volume claims."
good,"Progressive as a company is great, job title however not so much."
good,"The role I have is flexible and interesting. I control my own schedule but am an hourly employee which can be challenging in times of high volume. Some management is amazing and some is not depending on the work group you are a part of. The work can be repetitive but the peer group is a great group. "
good,"I was overqualified for the job. I could have jumped in as a senior manager.  Diversity is the key to their culture, received interesting phone requests from the most interesting customers."
good,So many people work from ccu you spend most of your time fixing there errors. set territory is constantly changing. As soon as you met your goals they totally change.
good,"Good place to start in the industry. Good benefits. gives you a starting point to learn about claims, Property, Automotive Parts and estimating software."
good,There is very little room for personal development.  Unless you are interested in working claims for a long period of time with little chance of cross training you are better off looking elsewhere
good,Progressive provides great benefits and software used was very to learn. Training provided could be better but is sufficient for someone that already has experience in the legal field. Salary is reasonable depending on the experience you have. The hardest part of the job is completing all tasks before the end of the day and making sure attorney reviews documents in a timely manner.
good,"Claims life is very negative, you are constantly dealing with upset customers which is very taxing. In addition, you are just a number at this job and at a satellite office you have low opportunity for advancement."
good,Progressive is great company thats trying to keep up with their growth and please their investors all at the same time.  Upper management (ceo and vp's) are all great at what they do however they can sometimes feel disconnected to  whats going on on the ground.  Local management is pathetic.  Because they hire from within they will give a person with 30 years experience a job that they have no skill set for and overlook a 10 year year guy that perfectly fits.  Tons of reorganizations which means frequent role changes and sometimes pay cuts.  Its all about the investors with Progressive
good,"The job isn't hard but it isn't easy neither. The hardest part about the job is getting services, because if a client already have Xfinity Service you can't sign them up."
good,"Working in Tampa was excellent. The weather the weather the weather."
good,The hours were awful for someone who has children and a family.  The off days are also awful. They are not consecutive and you work weekend with the horrible hours.
good,I clock in then I start preparing the work site for the rest of the workers to start they job  management is great all he have to do is tell me one time in the job is done theres really nothing hard about the job I really do enjoy anywhere I can work I just really love to work
good,"Good benefits, overall decent culture. Definitely a lot of changes recently in the senior leadership. Leadership is not a good at promoting people to other positions."
good,Good company with a solid culture. Significantly more opportunities at larger offices and the large hubs. Career advancement significantly impact by the engagement of upper level leaders. Very few opportunities outside of the 1st level of management as the company does a re-organization every 3-4 years.
good,"this is a good company to work for however get ready for a lot of work , a lot of people cant handle being a fast worker here you need to be , the pay is ok need better pay"
good,Progressive is a good company to work for if you like changes all the time and be subjected to Stats monthly. the turnover in a call center has increase in the last two years due to new management.
good,At times the call volumes could be a bit overwhelming and the work schedules are not very flexible. You are given all the tools needed to perform your job and the training you receive is top notch. The people you work with for the most part are very friendly and helpful.
good,It was a job not a career and i would not recommend anyone to work at this place. it was micromanaged and the employees did not feel the management had an open door policy
good,"Progressive is a great place to work. A typical day is ten to fourteen hours a day, with maybe a thirty minute lunch. A day consists of working claims, inbound and outbound calls."
good,Progressive is a great company to begin your career in the insurance business.  They have an excellent training location that teaches you the basics to the intricate.  The pay is on the low band for insurance companies but the training you will receive is second to none.
good,"Great culture and excellent supervisors! Unfortunately, higher ups dont understand how stressful it is to work on the phones. Cant move out of your schedule for a year, cant change departments for a year."
good,Progressive will provide you with paid training and help you attain an insurance license in the state of Florida. They provide great health benefits and some PTO. The big issue as a sales agent would be their lack of commission for an exceptional amount of sales.
good,Near the end of my time with the company the management decided that every estimate written by every employee had to be reviewed. It sent a chill through the ranks to know that the trained professionals were to be summarily reviewed on every step of their job process. It was tough to work in an environment where one could not simply do their job.
good,Nice company to work for allowed me flexible schedules. Easy commutes to assigned jobs. Rate iof pay is fair. Good repore between manager and employees.
good,Progressive was a decent place to learn the business.  Their training was very thorough but not always realistic.  At least in my branch we worked well as a team.  Pay was low for all the work that they expected.
good,"I was hired as a claims processor. Mainly just did filing, mail, answered phones, ordered police reports and ran errands for the office manager. Office was small and not very many people."
good,"Progressive takes the time and spends money to educate and train their employees.  Spends lots of time out on the road, very challenging when dealing with body shops."
good,"Progressive is a really good company to work for, unfortunately they have a lot of customers that hate the company and mistreat the employees. The hardest part of the job is total nastiness from customers. Most enjoyable part can also be the customers."
good,"you'll get paid well, but you'll want to rip your hair out daily .. it's really cool that all the supervisors used to be in your position, it's not like they hire random people as managers so you don't feel like you'll never get promoted, but don't expect lunch or appreciation if you're an appraiser"
good,"Progressive is a good company and I believe that they try to do the right thing. However, the turnover is high and management does seem to forget how demanding being a rep can be once they are promoted. Insurance is an extremely tough industry so I can attribute some of my negative feelings about Progressive."
good,"Busy and sometimes stressful environment.  Not for everyone, but benefits outweigh the stress.  Need to be flexible as directives change often, but that is part of staying ahead of the crowd."
good,"Good people. Work your way up culture. Typical day for me is 9am-6pm. Between taking inbound calls, placing outbound calls, meeting with customers, completing liability investigations, documenting files, ordering and reviewing police reports, taking recorded statements from people after accidents, and participating in meetings,your day will definitely be full.  It's not hard work, there's just a lot of it.  The volume will keep you on your toes."
good,"Typical day included interactions with project team, sponsors, and key stakeholders in support of project, program, or portfolio assignments.  Learned how centralized Enterprise Project Management Office (EPMO) functions can serve needs across a broad spectrum of organizational business areas."
good,"its a decent start. the attendance policy is very confusing. I've seen lots of people fired over miscommunication. Everyone seems to be working under different rules, management is not transparent."
good,"Fast paced & stressful at times. There are quotas even if you are not in sales. Management was lazy and expected you to do everything yourself &/or for them. If you have kids, this is not the place for you! Be a robot and expect to not help customers who truly need it! For example, a customer has cancer, her husband just died and her auto insurance cancelled. No human components. So if helping people is what motivates you or if you don't have a family, this is a good place to work."
good,"call center so answer calls all day"
good,"A typical day at work for me is answering customer service phone calls for 8 hours a day. what I learned is that you have to be patient, and kind to all customers. Management helps assist you to become a better you. The co-workers are great to be around. The hardest part of my job is talking to an upset customer, and the most enjoyable part of my job is turning an angry customer into a happy customer by the end of the call."
good,"A typical day at work was taking back to back calls from Progressive insureds. Maintaining policies, making changes, providing billing information, etc. It is a very self-developed environment, management is available but you are in charge of your day to day duties. It is an office location so you are surrounded by your team members who provide lots of support and help. The hardest part of my job was the repetitive nature of the position, most calls ran the same way. The most enjoyable part was being able to help others, customers and other members of my team."
good,This company made me wait 7 weeks to hear back after I passed all the interviews I was denied the call center position because I have a minor misdemeanor (a tactic from my ex husband and his lawyer). I was employed by a school system prior to this opportunity and I was denied answering phones! Phones for goodness sake!  Lol.
good,Inventory is too high. New employees are not given the time to learn how to manage the workload.  No work/life balance or I would've stayed. Co-workers were awesome!
good,Overall a good company. Gainishare is the end of the year bonus that keeps you motivated. Long hours management is always changing
good,"Micro management not for me. The company is good and cares for its employees, I was very impressed by that. The office environment is very nice and comfortable."
good,I learned great customer service handling skills and listening skills from training. I also learned a great deal about insurance in general and how it works. The information that was given to me was never open for interpretation but was well defined in training.
good,"Good company to work for, although communication and development is inconsistent at times. Overall probably in the middle with other companies."
good,It was enjoyable to work with the co-employees who you saw on a day to day basis. The problem is the company as a whole tends to lean towards a micro-management style.
good,The most enjoyable part of being a Claims Representative was helping clients find peaceful resolutions to otherwise fearful and confusing situations.
good,"Day to day call center lifestyle. Taking calls from customers about their questions on insurance coverage and other ways to help save them money on what they are paying on coverage and take payments and making adjustments on policies. I've learned many things about insurance and for the things I do not know, we do have a great resource of people that can answer any question that comes along."
good,"Typical call center, receives inbound calls.  Every day is the same.  Café, but no free lunches or coffee. "
good,"A typical call center, What you learned management co workers"
good,"Progressive`s employee benefit package is good with several levels of coverage to choose from.  The compensation is pretty reasonable as well."
good,"Used to an enjoyable place to work until management was overhauled. Mountains of work and expectations, reduced focus on employees. We used to feel appreciated now we all just feel like modern day slaves. Used to have a good training program but now the new people are just thrown to the wolves. We are expected to train them and try to complete our work. Co workers are great but the hardest part is you can never do 16 hours of work in an 8 hour day. Supervisors are not consistent. Some count occurrences, some make you use vacation time when not needed. No one is on the same page anymore."
good,"Assist insures in policy services with billing, payments, adding and deleting information on automotive policies while maintaining company quality;"
good,"nice place to work managers and coworkers were great to work with i enjoyed the information that i learned. the work enviorment was nice, this location had a fitness center and medical facilities,"
good,Very busy atmosphere which does not leave you time for family/friends. Micro managed but you will not get better training anywhere in the business.
good,"company has changed a lot in the past few years. It is more focused on profit than employee and customer satisfaction. Good place to start, but that is it."
good,I enjoy working with the clients but its a call center and Progressive has changed over the four years I've worked there and would like to pursue a career in Ins working for an independent broker
good,"*Typical day: Inbound Outbound calls. Input info into computer."
good,"A large and highly visible company, Progressive offers a wide variety of positions and is always reinventing ways to serve its customers and employees."
good,"Relaxed dress code, loved my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was working with unruly customers. Best part of the job was working with and being able to help people/customers."
good,They try to take care of their employees but used to do it a lot better than they do now.
good,"* Sat behind a desk all day and took phone calls."
good,"This place is a great place to work to get your foot in the door, but no room for advancemen beyond middle management."
good,Creativity is a must and is greatly celebrated.  Working with customers in achieving the goals in their own creativity is very rewarding.
good,"Help Desk / Network Administrator:"
good,Management is amazing they take very good care of their employees
good,Helping the customer resolve there issues was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,Company is willing to train the right person.  Many opportunities for advancement.
good,"Progressive has a great company culture and work environment, however, the work life balance is dismal at best. The amount of work you receive each day is insane compared to the compensation you receive for your non-stop work."
good,"Have not worked there in several years."
good,"This job is fine.  Typical day.  Management,  Co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is managing all of the claims."
good,Managing the team at Progressive was a positive experience for me. Our goal was to move this company from a sole proprietorship into a larger corporate structure. We were successful at more than doubling the revenues over a four year period and implemented a host of value-added controls and policies. We managed a good staff of seasoned professionals as well as developing new talent pool to compliment their expertise. We were challenged in meeting the new corporate objectives for sales and performance but always found a way to meet our objectives. A recent acquisition by PCC will help this company to grow further while maintaining profitable returns.
good,"The claims department at the Riverview facility is a new department and still working out wrinkles. Other than the split-shift, I would say the job was satisfactory."
good,The co-workers were wonderful. Management was more concerned with minute details rather than looking at the overall results and resolution. The compensation and benefits are better than most. The opportunities for advancement are minimal. The employees work hard and few managers express their appreciation for a job well done.
good,"The company lost sight that happy employees work harder. Took away differential pay, reduced benefits, etc."
good,"A typical day at work involved reviewing and evaluating new assignments of litigated files, contacting the insured to discuss the lawsuit and process and referring the file to defense counsel to represent the insureds for the lawsuit. It also involved continued evaluation of the files for settlement/resolution. I learned a great deal about the litigation process and AZ laws, as well as medical terminology. I very much enjoyed my co-workers, as we all strived to make it a fun environment to work in. The hardest part of the job to me was more of an emotional component to me, where people were paid on their claims more than what I thought was deserved. The most enjoyable part was being able to settle a claim and get the lawsuit dismissed against our insured."
good,"A typical day at work would be I arrive and get stuck into what needs to be done using my incentive and common sense. A day usually consists of working stock, helping the team and assisting customers in the shop. Management is friendly and supportive and team mates are a good laugh, a challange at work would be time management getting tasks done on time. And the most enjoyable part is the people including work mates and customers, socialising."
good,"I spent eight years investigating and resolving injury, damage, and fire and theft claims. I was part of Progressive's National Catastrophe Response Team."
good,Take an average of 80 calls a day
good,The actual work was a little repetitive but the poeple I worked with were great and the management was very good.
good,HR is definitely needing to re-train their staff. There is no follow through for those who get laid off.
good,Developed valuable skills. Pay and workload could be better.
good,"I generally like the people I work with. I love that i knew nothing about the world of organic foods and know my whole lifestyle has changed regarding my diet and eating habits. I am learning a lot about my body and what diet I should specifically adhere to. Management does not micromanage and you can work in a team or individually. But, most of the time the job requires teamwork. I am also learning a lot about a job i would like to do until I reach retirement years. It is always a pleasure to meet people from all over who is its the clinic. My job is a learning experience all the time.Things are always chugging with the insurance companies. This pretty much keeps me on my toes and I am in love with a good challenge."
good,"• My main responsibility was to resolve issues related to data warehouse, Stored procedures and analyzed, design and developed ETL strategies."
good,A typical day at work consist of answering phones and reporting laims. I learned computer and people skills. The hardes part of the job was listening to the things that happened to the customers. The most enjoable part of the job is knowing that you helped that person.
good,"Transcribe dictation; operate and maintain office equipment such as fax, printing and copying machines. Conducted proactive file maintenance forward files as needed to other employees; archive, update/manage filing system. Composed non-routine correspondence for a variety of purposes; assist with paperwork; Initiated calls to external customers, vendors, medical providers, local authorities to request, complete and expedite paperwork. Created and paid all billed medical invoices to vendors and third parties. Provided explanations of benefits to all vendors as per request."
good,"It's a good company with a laid back culture. I think they offer great pay and benefits. The management is not very professional and I think they take the casual attitude too far. Also, they should do a better job of letting their new reps in services know that they are expected to make ""offers"" to customers. Call it what you want, but it's a sales element that a lot of people don't expect."
good,The claim office for Arizona has very poor staff forecasting for how quickly they are growing. Constant overturn of staff. Expect to work 50-60 hours on low end salary.
good,"The people at Progressive could not be more friendly, helpful and accommodating.  The professionalism I experienced was second to none."
good,"Cons"
good,"stressful when your customers have just been in car accidents, but you can surprise them by being a hero to the situation. no room for advancement, but pay + Gainshare were amazing."
good,"You will be stretched to your max and then some on a daily basis. You will be subject to being bounced around from supervisor to supervisor due to ever changing management. Its all politics, you have to get in with the right people to advance"
good,Great company despite biased interviewing and hiring. Overall this is a good company. There needs to be more hires on managers hire up to ensure they are not hiring their own family
good,"Working at Progressive can have its ups and downs. Its has a great environment feel and options to work from home are great.  The typical day will consume being on the phone without anytime to breath between calls. "
good,"Okay place to start if you can get in on a position that is not entry level, they promise advancement opportunities but that's their way of saying we have one job open for over 50+ internal candidates to apply for ever few months or so."
good,"The work can get incredibly monotonous with the same tasks day in day out.  You only feel challenged while your learning a new task, then it's a long plateau."
good,"After working in customer service for 3 years, do not rely on your supervisor if you intend on advancing in the company. Do your absolute best up front and start applying to other positions, get out of customer service! If you do not mind cross selling and being told how to speak despite having excellent rapport with customers then by all means go for it. It just wasn't for me. One thing I can say that I did like about my position was the availability of overtime, gainshare (bonus pay), and the satisfaction of helping someone in a difficult situation. Good Luck and God Bless!"
good,Progressive is a good place to work with an inclusive culture. However you earn time off per paycheck based on tenure and this makes it difficult to accumulate or use time off. Work life balance is tough. You do not receive any paid sick time.
good,"Salary positions so expect to work over 40 hours weekly.  The benefits are nice, but the work life balance that gets told to you is not the reality. Its a great company to work for but you need to know your overall limit."
good,"Management needs support and training, overall good company to work for. Need to encourage more open communication with staff. Management did practice intimidation."
good,"workload is heavy, assigned several tasks on a daily basis which company knows in unmanageable"
good,"With the right supervisor there is room for advancement and growth. The opportunity to work remotely is available to a limited number of employers and is based on a certain criteria. Overall, the work environment is friendly, with co-workers willing to share knowledge for your betterment. The most difficult place is maintaining a satisfactory production status when call volumes are excessively high. Plenty of resources available to aid in job duties."
good,"Great work culture but heavy workload. Be prepared to stay late if you want to succeed. Paid fairly but should be compensated more, as for the workload."
good,"Frequent, harsh evals, every call recorded / reviewed, supervisors very critical - not recommended for thin-skinned people. Pay and benefits above average for call center jobs."
good,"- Great team work and work environment"
good,"Fun but stressful. If you are in it for the money, you will be fine. If you don't like a lot of stress, this is not the job for you. Everything has to be perfect down to the letter. The atmosphere is pleasant until you don't make your mark. It was too stressful for me but I came through a temp agency."
good,"Entry positions are for claims generalist and you receive some basic training.  Most of your training will be otj.  Must like talking on the phone, be very organized, and have the ability to explain what people have in their policies."
good,"Working in ITSD with progressive, expect to come into work and take customer service calls from the start of your shift till the end, most incoming calls to the progressive ITSD are customer service related and anyone who has completed basic computer knowledge courses will be able to work within the front line of the IT service Desk."
good,I did not enjoy working in customer services with such an emphasis on selling. I could understand if it was a stretch goal or secondary metrics. The truth is that progressive is more worried about up selling than building relationships.
good,"Progressive is a proud organization always wanting to lead the industry. It is an innovative organization and expect their people to be competitive."
good,"I stay about 9 hours a day at the call center. The job itself is not so difficult; You clock in, you take calls, you assist customers, and stay compliant with insurance laws in whatever state your customer is maintaining a policy in. The part of the job that is difficult would have to be the call center itself. It's like watching office space on rerun, the corporate atmosphere is toxic often times and lends itself to be difficult to navigate. The attendance policy can be strict, but it is understandable, as the turnover rate has been rising over the past few years. The scheduling is pretty inflexible, and if you have a specific schedule you need to work, it is a challenge to maintain if anything happens in your personal life."
good,"Call centers are the worst. Being on the phone for 8-9 hours a day is rough. Also, when you consider the type of people this company insures, they are rude and mean. RUN."
good,I can only speak about my job as a total loss claims adjuster. It is very stressful and it is not something I would recommend to anyone. Work-life balance is unheard of and it is time for me to move on to another company.
good,"Progressive is a great company to work for, they really look after their employees and try to make life and work balance a prority. It is a call center, so it was difficult for me not to have that one on one face time encounter helping our customers."
good,"Most enjoyable part of working at Progressive are the people as they are wonderful. Management are promoted from within which is great but at the same time does not mean they are the best Managers.  Progressive has a culture that is very High stress, High volume with Micromanaging. It is very hard emotionally to work in this environment as they always give you more work than you can do in a day. The office is very noisy as there are about 20 people in the office and most are always on the phone or chatting which can wear on you and make work more challenging."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Progressive. They have fantastic training and opportunity to move up if you live in the right location. They do have some unrealistic work/life expectations that made the job easier to leave.
good,You get what you put in. There is room for advancement but keep in mind that this field is a widely saturated therefore you have to put in 100% to get notice.
good,"I enjoyed the first few years of my career there, However the focus shifted from customer service to sales. After that point the company became numbers driven and your job no longer felt safe,"
good,Good place to work. Good pay. Supervisors and coaches do a good job. They charge alot for their insurance so many disgruntled customers call in which can be stressful.
good,"I was sent for 2 weeks out of town for training, told to forget everything I had learned and that I would be showed everything I needed to know in CA. DID NOT HAPPEN. Micro managed? They'll sit behind you while your on the phone, monitor you on their laptop, send you messages abut your current conversation, and want immediate answers while your trying to note conversations with customers. Work Load? Unrealistic expectations....Money is great if your hourly... Management? they'll find ways to blame you instead of looking at their poor training.... Overall... I wouldn't do it"
good,The job helps you surf multiple programs at one time. You learn different coverages and insurance ins & outs. cross sell other products and identify additional coverages that might be needed.
good,Work is very intense and highly managed.  There is often difficult customers to deal with.  Excellent training is given and job objectives are very clear.
good,"A typical day at Progressive can be challenging, but fun as well.. The hardest part about the job is getting customers on a monoline product to add additional products to their insurance roster.  Not much micromanaging, but very data driven company.. I learned much about home, auto, and special lines insurance sales.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers make very hard decisions about insurance coverage for their most valuable assets and possessions and can't forget about the nice gainshare check that all employees receive at the end of the year."
good,"Investigated, adjusted, and payment of No-Fault Medical claims. Evaluate treatment for medical necessity. Determined Cash Reserves based on claimant's injuries. Established verbal and written"
good,"Great Company to work for, lots of work but has great pay to make up for the workload and great people to work with."
good,"I started just out of high school, working there for a total of 5.5 years. It was amazing because I love art. The cons for that job, is that when I got married, there was no lee-way in taking time off."
good,"For an entry level candidate, Progressive provides an excellent entry platform for the young IT professional. Having the ability to interact with technologies both old and new provides an excellent insight to how a corporation implements these technologies for their goals.  The people you work with are very knowledgeable and provide a lot of information to learn from."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is positive energy, management assist with career advancement. The hardest part of the job is unconventional schedule.  Work schedule changes annually and based on job performance."
good,"A typical day at work started with logging onto the computer. From there, I proceeded to skip trace and contact debtors by phone to work out a payment arrangement. I would get an hour for lunch, then upon returning from lunch follow through with any appointments I had made for contact. Once that was completed, I would continue skip tracing and contacting people through telephone leaving messages for contact as needed. Once able to reach someone, I would advise them of the debt, and attempt to work out a payment arrangement."
good,"I enjoyed working for Progressive, however, if I would have had more supportive coworkers and better management, the experience would have been much more enjoyable. The benefits and work/life balance were excellent."
good,"Starting out at this company, I immediately noticed the positive atmosphere. People were smiling and welcoming. Training was a blast and the people on my team were just phenomenal. Once you actually start taking phones, things change. There are many monthly and weekly metrics you must make on top of taking 70-120 calls a day. Most of these calls were dealing with company or other service consultant's mistakes. The call volume is always back to back no matter what day it is, and if you do have a slow day, they send all of the early shifts home so the call volume goes right back up. Most of your phone calls are very irate customers and rate increases. The company is more worried about selling their products rather than providing excellent customer service. Selling products to irate customers proved to be a very difficult and high stress level task. This job is not for everyone. Most people quit within 6 months, and most of those people either walked out, or just never came back. There was some sort of systems issue almost every single day which made it very difficult to do your job. If you like a call center atmosphere, and high call volume, I would definitely consider this company."
good,"Very demanding, great for college kids to make some extra income. Took the job while looking for a job in my preferred career."
good,"A typical day at work would be managing the claims processors and their daily activities.  I would also interact with senior level management to assist each of them with tasks requested of me. Once I moved into the position of Medical Claims Adjuster, my main responsibility would be assisting customers that were injured in motor vehicle accidents by considering reimbursement of medical expenses if they sought treatment for injuries as well as consider reimbursement of lost wages if they were unable to work."
good,"Great job...good co workers.  Loomis and LaPann had no room for advancement, thus the need to work elsewhere.  Liked working with customers and satisfying their needs."
good,You will be very busy but at least you are treated like a human being unlike by companies that use green reptiles in commercials.
good,"A typical day at work would be answering phone calls from customers and helping them in any way you can with whatever it is they need."
good,"The best part about working for Progressive is my colleagues.  They typically have similar interests and have common personality traits.  Days are spent mostly in a cubicle-type set up with a computer and phone.  You are assigned claims throughout the day and depending on your tenure level, you are given instruction/direction on some of the more complex coverage and/or liability scenarios.  Progressive has a job objectives throughout handling of the claim that include timeliness of our initial contact with customers, positive customer experience and overall accuracy. My current position is within a virtual team, where team members and leadership are scattered in different states and all communication is done via email, webinars, phone conferences, etc.  As a Progressive employee for seven years, I appreciate the autonomous aspect that the virtual team brings, as I am self-motivated and need very little direction to achieve positive outcomes for customers while exceeding corporate standards."
good,A good job to teach you about personal insurance and other insurance fields.
good,"I supervise a team of 10 dispatchers who oversee the distribution of auto and special line vehicles including motorcycles, boats and RV’s for estimators in 11 states including Texas. We have the ability to work from home on Monday and Friday and then we are in the office Tuesday – Thursday. My immediate manager is based in California and is new to a leadership role handling hourly reps. My fellow supervisor is also new to the role with less than 1 year of tenure. So adding this to the fact that this is a new group within Progressive it has been an exciting year and a half. I have a great schedule of Monday – Friday 6:30 to 3:30 AM.. Overall this is a reliable and secure company to work for."
good,I did learn alot and loved my coworkers.  The  hardest part was dealing with irate customers due to them not paying their bills on time.
good,Willing to train the right person.  Many chances for advancement.
good,My day to day consists of working my assigned case load to close claims and provide great customer service.  The management team in Spokane is great as well as my co-workers.  Everyone is very supportive and appreciative of my efforts.  I have been doing this job for 5+ years and am just looking for a new challenge.  I am looking to move back to Portland and there are no opportunities for advancement currently available.
good,"Once settled into the area of assigments for our geographic zip code area (where we each resided) the areas were changed and caused us all to learn different driving routes, different shops, etc. It was a challenge to us all."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Progressive. I started my career in a customer service role, eventually working my way up to a leadership position in claims. I enjoyed almost everyone I worked with, and the ever changing flow of work always kept me sharp."
good,"Mixed bag of what you can expect here. I was older and had a family, which did not fit in with the highly social and meet for a drink after work atmosphere. Typically, if you are a person that does their job good or mediocre and play the social popularity game, you did not have to have good knowledge of what you were doing. There were many doing an incomplete job, but were able to move on because of social connections."
good,"I really enjoyed who I worked with, I have truly made some great friends here."
good,"They have just started hiring after a few years of being understaffed so an entry level position can be received fairly easy at this time. However, there is still restructuring in management which means almost no opportunity to advance."
good,"Progressive pays well, however, get ready to work extremely long hours. Training is a cake walk, however, once you leave on boarding you can easily get overwhelmed with the sheer amount of work. You get new claims daily, and if yesterdays customer didn't answer when  you called they become a new claim tomorrow- plus all of the outstanding claims. Attorney offices calling in, medical providers, insured customers, and claimant customers all calling in- so it is easy to get in the weeds. Management is okay but most supervisors walk around the office chit chatting and don't really help with the workload."
good,They tell you one thing and do another. Shady practices. I had ADA accommodations and they find a way to mess with you anyway. I don't at all reccomend.
good,"I left because while they have a Core Value of the Golden Rule...it seemed closer to...they were more worried about the competition getting the Gold so they forgot their Rules of putting the customer first and valuing good customer service. "
good,"Great company. Just fast paced and stressful. As long as you follow to the letter of how they want you to perform, all is good. Stable company with good benefits"
good,"When I started at Progressive in 2003 it was more of a ""Family Run Business"" type of culture, and a fun work environment.  Since 2010 or so the business culture changed and Progressive became more of a ""Corporate Shareholder"" type of business.  The stressed increased as did the workload, and management became distant in their willingness to understand the situation. Instead of a engaging cooperative work environment, it became a ""Call Center"", and at times toxic to where it became difficult to feel compassion and understanding from co-workers and especially from management."
good,"I learned a lot.  The job is stressful, and the pay is decent for what the job requires.  The management staff could be better.  The employee benefits are awful, especially the vacation days."
good,"I've been working live claims for some months now and i simply didn't anticipate the shock i'd receive once the claims really rolled in. Everyone did warn me I'd feel overwhelmed, but that was putting it mildly. Most of my days I'm settling multiple total losses, while attorneys and customers are blowing up my phone, new claims that are priority piling up, supervisor demanding me do certain tasks immediately, constantly pulled aside for meetings, and so many little tasks that are still outstanding but just not feasible to do within an 8 hr day. This is not a 40 hr a week job, it's just not. Honestly get nervous to even take a lunch because i come back to plenty voicemails and claims to work."
good,"The culture was pretty fun but the job itself felt purposeless.  I started working there with hopes to move up and find a passion.  Instead, I took phone calls for almost a year until I just couldn't do it anymore.  You literally just sit on the phone all day. Not very exciting."
good,"There is no down time in claims. The claims adjuster is worked until exhaustion. The pay is well and the yearly bonus was really good. The job is fast paced but there is not enough time in the day for you to complete everything. Customer calling, voice mall, emails, setting up repairs, doing coverage investigation, going over total loss documents, etc. Even after doing all of this the new claims keep coming in. I never had a job that if you miss one day you are be hide for a week. You are allowed to take your computer home to finish but its only so much you can do at home, so many phone calls to make."
good,"Despite the role being customer service you were expected to cross sell their other products. I had many customer compliments, by metrics that were not related to cross selling their homeowners were superb, but because I didn't feel comfortable offering homeowners after a customer told me there husband died, or they just lost their job, or they were yelling at me because their premium increased for no good reason what so ever  I was not able to advance to to a  different department. During the interview process they said you can advance after 6 months of doing the phones, but what they dont tell you its dependent on how well you sell their homeowners lines which to be honest is not that cheap, and other companies offer better rates, and coverages."
good,Everyone can get the opportunity to work from home but you are are stuck at your desk waiting on a acall and i got bored the more i moved up 20 minutes between calls and pay never increased
good,Have an on site cafeteria and a nice gym. High paced ever changing and constantly changing the goals for customer service. Otherwise a good place to work.
good,training and support are poor; decisions made by management are based on relationships instead of performance. they don't give acknowledgement or praise
good,The hardest part of the job was getting time with management to offer up suggestions.  Project load was from 1 - 4 projects. Responsible for the milestones and project deliverables.
good,"The company makes it a crucial point to hire the right type of person. And this has really paid off in terms of the quality of people you will come to know as your co-workers. However, in spite of the quality of hire, the quality of management has dropped off significantly in the time I was employed by Progressive. The nature of the company allows Supervisors to move around to different positions in an attempt to encourage a holistic view of the company. While this sounds great on paper- what has happened instead has been Supervisors collecting different position titles in roles they never become proficient in- and then they leave for another department. No consistent leadership to galvanize the great employees they hire. Each department is a ship lost at sea changing captains, never finding land, but at least you have the comradery."
good,"The biggest drawback is the high expectations and high work load and volume. It's not possible to get your work don't in a 8 hour day. More often. The not your putting in at the least 10 hour days without the extra pay. "
good,Progressive is a good company to begin a carrier in IT with. It is a great environment and the people are amazing. Starting at the T1 position it is less technical work and more call center oriented.
good,"The job is highly stressful and overwhelming. You get assigned a high volume of claims daily while having to manage the rest of your active claims. A normal 8 hour work day is rare, you are expected to work a lot of unpaid overtime just to try and stay caught up. You are also heavily micromanaged. However, the work environment is a positive at least."
good,"It is not too bad, just long days on the phones, one call after the other. Some days are more stressful then others. Depends on the people on the other end of the line too."
good,"Honestly, it is a good job. Not great, but good. Chaotic, sometimes mismanaged, and the customers are largely extra. Supervisors are decent, if inconsistent. Great benefits, decent pay. Mixed bag. Left because call centers are stressful train wrecks no matter where you work."
good,Overall Progressive is an okay place to work.  If you don't have much of a personal life and are at t the point in life where you want to advance your career this is the place to do it.  With that being said this job often requires long hours as there is more work given to you that can be completed in a 40 hour work week.
good,"Customers are amazing, a couple of escalations but hardly any company errors, usually it's grown adults trying to blame others for their mistakes. Open door policy is great. Management isn't much helpful. You'll never get an accurate answer, you'll have to go through dozens of other people to get your question answered. I wish they offered more schedule flexibility for students but if you're looking for a job that will just cover your bills, this one's it."
good,"I work regular hours of business, but it's super busy from the moment you clock in. You begin with checking your voicemail and returning all phone calls which varies from 30 minutes to a couple of hours. As soon as you complete your voicemail's, you begin your daily work load ( Approx. 10 claims a day). You must be detail-oriented, the ability to multi-task, have proper manners, have telephone etiquette, and  have a basic level of computer skills. I would say that patience is really needed, because you're dealing with customers at a very difficult time of their lives. Management is unreasonable, are far as time. I felt like they were asking for too much in very little time. The workplace culture seems ideal, but not everybody follows it. I would say that the hardest part of the job is time management and informing your customer that they are in the wrong. But the most enjoyable part of the job is your peers, because they completely understand the first steps of the job and they're willing to stick out their hands and help out."
good,"I liked everything my last job . Progressive taught me important lessons about about business and achievement. Looking for an opportunity to use skills to perform and contribute. The people were the most enjoyable part of the job. A typical work day was high paced.The hardest part was getting an opportunity to obtain my license. at Progressive I  learned to be a team player, self motivated,self directing , to use pro active listening skills, excellent verbal and written communication,goal oriented, organized, precise, to be a leader, problem solving , being able to make decisions, and asseriveness"
good,Progressive has greatcore values and views in family life but it's not well followed in small offices. Your expected to work 40+ hours a week regularly and usually it would mean working on your day off just to complete work that was  considered your normal day work. It's easy to get burned out if you don't take time off regularly.
good,"The headline is a bit cynical, but the reality is that you don't really have the option to stand behind your belief on what is right or wrong within the work environment.  The job itself is manageable, it's the way that they distribute workload that seems to be a controversial topic.  It seems that the better you are at your job the more work you  WILL do, that is the end result.  If you present facts, figures, group opinion, etc. you are seen as an instigator and not a ""team player"". Again, although this seems like a gripe its not, its just a glimpse at a day in the life of.... Apply and work there for yourself, its not like a rated the overall experience that poorly, just not an ideal place to work."
good,Not bad but not great. It lacks in pay and flexibility for time off. The hours are horrible and will rob you of relationships and a life. You can not change your hours for a year of being there and the options to pick really have their downfalls all the way around.
good,"I don't mind a cubicle, they provide you space. Lots of natural light as well. The job varies by department and the stress level follows that trend. Management can be very prickly and may trigger anger for any employee that needs attention. The heardest thing of the job is turning off your emotions and being stone-cold. You're cursed at, threatened, and some of the people mean it. The only good thing for me was the pay and the benefits. But that's not enough for everyone."
good,Fast paced work environment with a lot of time spent on the road to meet with insureds and claimants and meet the company's time and accuracy requirements for resolution.  Increased my skill level on multitasking.  Good compensation package.
good,"The pay is great; however, is you are in personal lines service, expect to take about 75 to 95 calls a day, and never get a break in between. You are able to take your breaks and lunches at any time; however, if everyone decides to go at the same time, there is no real WFM to get agents back on the phone. They are definitely a laid back employer; however, I think they are too laid back."
good,"training was excellent, very cultural, caring of employees, stressful at times...fast paced. Made a lot of life long friends.  Learned specific state laws of auto insurance."
good,Η Progressive είναι μία εκ των κορυφαίων διαφημιστικών εταιρειών στην Ελλάδα και ήμουν τυχερή που συνέβαλα για έξι μήνες σε αυτόν το χώρο.Ήμουν στο τμήμα celebrities με μια acount manager μέσω της οποίας έμαθα να καθοδηγούμαι. Ήταν ένας αρκετά απαιτητικός χώρος αλλά η αίσθηση της παραγωγικότητας και της δημιουργίας  ήταν αρκετή για να φύγω γεμάτη γνώσεις και έτοιμη για το επόμενο επαγγελματικό μου βήμα.
good,"I started at Progressive as a contractor in November of 2016. I was starting my second week on their IT Helpdesk and everything was wonderful. Coworkers and managers were friendly. The Environment is relaxed. The hardest part for me was sitting at a desk all day, but it was definitely  worth it in the end. The reason for my low points was the fact that when I returned home from work on the 8th day of employment, my contract agency called me and told me Progressive terminated my contract, and I am forbidden to contact them for any reason. The only thing I could get from them when asked why was that it ""was not performance related"" So they fired me because I didn't deserve it. If there was something I said, I do not know. Some I did, no idea. This company was great to work for for the week I did, but I find their way of terminating without reason or explanation very disturbing."
good,the company is ok however I have negative feels because of a particular manager. this is all I'm going to write about there isn't much details I want to give
good,"Responsible for handling insurance claims filed by policyholders. Plans and schedules work needed to process claim, interviews claimant and witnesses, and investigates claims. Handle property claims involving damage to buildings and structures, or liability claims involving personal injuries or third-person property damage from liability situations, such as motor vehicle accidents, slip and falls, dog bites, or alleged negligent behavior. Consult with accountants, architects, construction workers, engineers, lawyers, and physicians to get expert evaluation. Work with attorneys to defend insurer's position as claim is contested and issue payout amounts accordingly and accordantly. Negotiate with claimant to settle claim. overall very stress full and under paid."
good,"My job was to attend appoinments with the eldrley. Light housekeeping, My toughest job was having a bed bound patient. Other then that i really enjoyed doing this job co workers were great and i also always loved every manager i had"
good,"It was a company that grew into the fourth largest insurance company. It was very innovative and not afraid to take risks. Always taking chances to change in order to grow, profit and make themselves different from the rest."
good,"The work itself is not particularly difficult.  If you are good at problem solving, critical thinking, negotiation, and assertive decision making you will be successful."
good,"When I started Progressive was a great place to work, but they incorporated a lot of changes over the last three years that changed the environment. Through these changes they lost countless tenured employees and embittered others. I tried to stay positive. Progressive was still a decent place to work at, just not ""one of the best places to work"" like it had been.  That being said, I worked in the call center. When I first started there was a steady call volume, but not overwhelming. But that changed to an environment of back-to-back high stress calls. There is very little if any off-time from the phones. Pay is equal or greater to similar jobs in the area and there are many opportunity for advancement if you can perform well enough in your position.  The problem is that the expectations are constantly being increased, which makes it difficult to meet your metrics. That and the fact that they continued to add on new metrics without removing any of the old ones.  The number of things you were expected to do on a call that had nothing to do with assisting the customer was unbelievable. There were equal amounts of amazing managers and mediocre ones so the environment was also dependent on who you had for a manager. However, there were frequent management changes. In my three years at Progressive I had 6 different managers/teams. No joke. I will say camaraderie at Progressive is amazing. I always got along fantastically with my co-workers, but because teams changed so frequently it was difficult to develop lasting relationships.  All in all, it probably doesn't seem so bad, because"
good,Difficult to balance work/life and assistance is difficult to find due to multiple meetings for managers on a weekly basis.
good,Very high call volumes. Unhappy customers. Average pay. I didn't enjoy the work the customers were mostly unhappy. It was a long time ago that I worked there so  I don't remember why but I know I was not fond of management.
good,"not enough hours in day to complete tasks given"
good,"Very stressful jobs lots of metrics and not enough time. "
good,"A typical day involved great organization and planning skills"
good,"Workload is rough...most of the time."
good,"A typical day in the life of a customer insurance rep consisted of talking to a wide range of people from all over the United States about their insurance policies and how insurance works.  "
good,"•	Reviewed claims, planned recommendations, evaluated damage, and resolved unrepresented injury and property damage claims. "
good,"For the most part, Progressive is a fun place to work. They have many offline activites for employess to participate in to take stress of normal workday. They offer two cafeterias for lunch and breakfast at decent prices. There is also a full service gym available to all employess and their families. Unfortunately, there is not much room for career advancement within Progressive which causes much turnover and disgruntlement within the organization."
good,Fast paced environment with multiple changes within a short time period. Need to be able to adapt and have a small work/life balance. Good perks with gainshare at the end of the year and time off is nice as well.
good,"I do like progressive, but hate being in their P&C insurance sales role. I was told it's very organic and unscripted, this is not the case. Sure I can say most things how I want, as long as I use their sales guide. This inevitably makes me sound like a used car salesman."
good,"If you buy into the culture you are golden. "
good,"Don't let them fool you, it's a call center.  You'll be on the phone all day!  The management hierarchy is ridiculous and changes all the time.  The managers and trainers themselves are cool otherwise."
good,"Loved the job  but very fast past and overwhelming. Management depends on who you get maybe be good or bad. My experience was good.  Claim expectation is demanding, it can be achieved with overtime."
good,"walk in clock in and make calls right away."
good,"Like being around  the poeple i work with, If you are working claims you will rarely bea ble to talk to them though. Lots of Claims coming your way and will most certainly need to do OT just to stay afoat and off the radar. System is a mish mash of new and old (think ms dos merged with windows 7). they are always trying new things and seems like they listen to some of the gripes. PTO is near imposible to get off and you wont want to cause those claims will keep you up at night."
good,"company really isnt that supportive for family emergencies. I left due to scheduling it didnt work for me, other than that it was a decent place to work. If i had a better schedule i would go back"
good,"Typical day was over 100 calls.  The call center environment is really relaxed: jeans/tshirts/flip flops acceptable and you can have whatever you like on your desk.  The only problem is that most customers will yell and cuss.  There aren't a lot of opportunities for advancement in the Tampa offices as the home offices are in Cleveland.  Other than that, the benefits were great, the 401k match is better than most, and no complaints with the health insurance."
good,The organization goes above and beyond with training.  .The continuous education requirements are met prior to needing them.  The organization as a whole is stellar
good,"This is a great company to work for in terms of culture.  The offices are brightly lit and have artwork hanging on the walls.  It is generally much more vibrant than other contact centers where I've worked.  They strike a good work/life balance by guaranteeing time off approval as long as you've got the time accrued.  They also offer work from home which is great.  Unfortunately, the pay is average at best and the workflow is repetitive and relentless.  The whole 3 years I worked for Progressive I always felt like call volumes were completely out of hand and we were always understaffed.  It is mentally exhausting to be swamped all day every day making 36k a year."
good,The company offers great pay and benefits.  There is opportunity for growth if you work hard.  Leadership provides feed back on a regular basis.  It is a very fast paced environment.
good,Progressive is a great place to work that provides a great salary if you come in at the right time. I am definitely here at the wrong time where Chicago is EXTREMELY short staffed. You also need to have a tough skin to work here because you will no doubt get yelled at by customers.
good,"The workplace is fine, there is room for improvement. The benefits are great pay is great as well. For a company that has over 1,000 employees they have great business ethics."
good,Progressive takes care of it employees and creates a family environment. Yet the work requires lots and lots of attention and you will be told you may be a high legal risk if not performing correctly. Lots of navigation of the computer but they teach you all the tools you need to know
good,"Salary and benefits are one of the best around, especially when compared to other large corporations. "
good,"Flexible work environment."
good,"Great co-workers, did primarily soft tissue injuries.  Job objectives were set for closures and efficiency which I met regularly."
good,Great group of people and met many lifelong friends.  Company moving to more of a cookie cutter mentality where you were rewarded for coming up with new innovative ways to handle your workload.
good,"-very busy "
good,Overall good company with good benefits and competitive pay. Workload is heavy and demanding and can be draining.
good,"Your typical call center receiving calls helping people find quotes, payments and cancellations."
good,"Good start in the industry, no day is the same, good co workers, solid management depending on the office, limited advancement opportunities if not in the home offices in Cleveland"
good,"I loved working at Progressive, unfortunately procedures had changed to an order that in my opionion made my job very difficult and put a lot of pressure on us. They used to care about their employees opions."
good,"Typical day at work is helping customers resolve their problems and ease their concerns. The specialty team I am on is always busy! I learn something new everyday because insurance is forever changing and updating depends on the state and the type of product. My co workers are awesome! Easy going, down to earth, and hard working just like me! Most enjoyable part of my job is making my customers happy and resolving complex problems!"
good,"High volume workplace, Can sometimes get overwhelming if not properly managed. Supervisors are helpful & co-workers are helpful. Corn horn & mini golf is available to relieve the stress"
good,"The environment and coworkers are amazing!! However, what they told us in training was not what the job actually entailed. Long hours on the phone, but the desks move so you can sit or stand. It wasn’t for me, but overall it’s a great company and opportunity. Pay not what was originally told either, though not bad."
good,"It was a great company to work for. I enjoyed the diversity of customers. I am experienced in Microsoft office, excel, outlook, etc. "
good,They really care about their employees it’s just boring. But if you like the call center outlook this place is definitely for you. It’s the perfect place to work.
good,"assigned claim/ suits to manage, receive new claims / suits everyday while managing the current claims / suit you have."
good,Progressive has a good culture. The company largely promotes from within so often times the upper management is good and understands the difficulties of the day to day.
good,"Typically answer about 100 calls a day, have limited time at the beginning of everyday to take care of any follow up items to resolve. Very metric driven job stats are very important but not difficult to maintain. Managers are very open for the most part there is an open door policy."
good,"Inbound Sales Representatives receive their producers license within two weeks, followed by a 4-month training process."
good,"This company was amazing to work for in 2011 when I first started here. By time I left in 2014 it was a completely different story, all they cared about was the bottom line. Be prepared to hit all of your numbers or you will be warned and eventually terminated.  I decided to leave because they were taking away all of the flexible schedules and implementing schedules based on your job performance. I was missing time due to an Auto accident so I assumed and was basically told I would get a shift I didn't want. With two young kids and Dr. appointments that just wasn't feasible. As time went on I asked more people how they felt about the workplace. I learned many of them were on meds to cope with the stress. I put my 2 weeks in and couldn't be happier."
good,Progressive is a great company. However being a Claims Adjuster just makes you really rethink applying to the job in the first place. The workflow is very overwhelming and the expectations and requirements are excessive.
good,Its not a bad place to work.  Its extremely fast-paced and the sales consultants are not paid enough for the volume of calls received and the amount of policies sold.  They should pay sales people more.  The calls come back to back and you never have a chance to decompress between calls.  If you have never made more than $15.00/hr this job is perfect for you.
good,"Typical work day includes answering calls for eight hours. I definitely  learn patience working there. Management is a hit or miss, all supervisors do micro-manage so be used to someone constantly watching over your shoulders even if you are a top performer. Progressive does have a few employee appreciation days so that helps. The customers are honestly the worst part of the job, I understand that insurance is a pain but these customers will tear you apart over a few bucks. Also the attendance policy is pretty strict."
good,"Everyone is willing to help out. All you have to do is ask. Finding the right mentor is key. Just because someone has been her for a long time does not necessarily mean they know what they are doing. "
good,"Worked here for over 15 years, learned a lot from Progressive insurance company in ways of Corperate America. Progressive had a Re-organization and I was let go.. But I'm not bitter, On to greener pastures. Thanks Progressive.."
good,Progressive Insurance has a stellar training program to prepare new hires for an over training in whichever area of claims you are handling.
good,"My work consists of answering incoming agent calls from our independent agencies. Support the agents in quotes, customer inquiries and problems with the system or individual policies."
good,"learned to deal with different attitudes,Leaned that dealing with the mentally challenged.Can be very challenging once I learned how to deal with there different attituded from a every day bases"
good,At first it was a great plase to work but as soon as I reported harrasment from a well liked lead I was shuned. I was moved off the team as if I had done something wrong.
good,"You are expected to get a certain percentage of customers to transfer to sales to do a quote, as part of your metrics. Even if you do your part and offer it and they say no, causing you to not hit the quota for that metric, you get a write-up and eventually fired. Doesn't matter that you offered it and they said no. Only matters if they say yes and COMPLETE a quote."
good,"Call volume is outrageous. No break in between calls to take a breath or drink some water. Advancement is difficult in my opinion.  Whatever you do, do not get stuck in sales, it is what I refer to as the ""bottom feeders of Progressive"". Underpaid, under appreciated and over worked, in my opinion. High stress job. However, the Communication is constant and the Benefits are great."
good,if you are ok working call center work with back to back calls then its decent. The bonus around Christmas is awesome. I dislike the promotion process.
good,"Progressive hires a lot of really nice people, but sometimes the focus seems to be on just all ""collaborating"" rather than being really productive. That can be frustrating. But it certainly isn't the worst place I've worked, and the benefits are pretty good."
good,"calls calls calls...........every move you make you are linked in your phone mode "
good,"They really take care of you because the work is a bit stressful and fast paced. But understandable. They take care of you really well. In my experience it was a bad to horrible one because of the lack of support and help from management, as I was working at a remote location away from any help...only help was through a chat and even then they would take for ever and made it really tough when you have customers waiting on the line. They did not take it into consideration and just through claims at you."
good,When they started the new process for scheduling it threw the entire company into a test sequence and that did not make for an easy going work place
good,"I was there many years ago, and loved my time there until things changed.  The company suffered a rash of layoffs in the region where I was, changed locations, and the manager was a vindictive person who purposefully went after certain people to make their working life awful to push them from the company.  I found out many years later that he ended up being terminated.  "
good,Overall a good place to work. Good benefits. The hardest part of the job was all of the phone calls. 70 to 100 per day.
good,"Good company to work for, great benefits, positive people, small workplace environment. You can work from home if you’re ill. Overall a pretty decent company to work for."
good,Working at progressive was fun an interesting. Training was three weeks long in which i spend two of those weeks in Arizona and one week in Ohio. They take good care of you at training and teach you everything you need to know to be successful in your position.
good,"great supervisor, different culture background everyone repected each other even management . work was enjoyable ."
good,You have to understand ahead of time that you are monitored 100%. You feel like someone is always looking over your shoulder listening to you. I liked helping people but you had better not take to long helping them. I was asked if I was from the south because I didn't speak fast!
good,Progressive insurance in a fabulous place to work. I just did not like working in a call center after being in field services for most of my career.
good,"I started working at Progressive as an intern in their break/fix department. I was selected right out of my CIS class in high school. While it was a great company to work for, I wish they would have had me do more work that was relevant to my CIS classes I was taking. Most of my work involved blue collar labor such as wrapping up cables."
good,Great company.. They respect you and are so flexible. Would never leave 
good,Company values and guiding principles are good but do not trickle down past corporate very well. Too many micro-managing supervisors that fail to provide their employees with opportunities to excel versus providing the employee with development and support to grow into job roles and functions. Company leaves much to desire for its employees.
good,"The company as a whole has a great idea and plan, but there is poor management on a local level that creates a uncomforatable atmosphere to work in. Employees aren't treated fairly and there is a fear of retailiation."
good,This company doesn't put care and consideration where it should go. The employees that actually interact with customers are treated like bottom of the totem poll. CRM is a terrible department.
good,People have been in their roles for many years without advancing or growing.  You have to be open to working at least one day every weekend.  You do not get paid bonuses for performance.
good,Enjoyable place to work. Company not promote well enough work/life balance.
good,"Easy job, little room for growth. Was able to work from home which was nice, and had no ""work outside of work"" which was great, but job got very monotonous and had no room to grow."
good,"Worked for the company for several months, the company management was very supportive and able to work with its employees on time off and sick days."
good,Claims environment is fast paced.  Micro managed and too high a case load to effectively manage cases.  Great staff - quarterly audits on case files from management team at different venues.  Long hours.
good,Good benefits and salary.  Work long hours and late in the day.Meet and greet customer before giving a damage appraisal.
good,I loved going to work everyone were friendly and I felt comfortable there only thing was that they weren't giving enough hours a week.
good,"Progressive was a great place to start my career, and I have gained valuable knowledge working there. I have been there 8 years, and just do not see much room for advancement beyond this point. "
good,It was a pleasure to be apart of Progressive Inc. I met new people with outstanding personalities. Everyday going to work was a joy.
good,Progressive was a nice job just needs better management. They rarely give raises due to their union. But the residents make the job a better plus to work
good,It has been a few years since I worked at Progressive.  When I did work in such an environment it challenged me to learn more as well as motivated me.
good,Overall the company is progressive in their vision and their thinking with a strong lack in shareholder management and communication.  direction is confusing as shareholder have alternative agendas without a universal goal for the day to day running of the business.
good,"You have to understand from the beginning that this is a call center job. You will be taking calls all day and they are usually very busy. I was told during the interview that sales consultants only have to take 10-15 calls a day which is not at all true. You are expected to ""maximize your availability"" which basically means being strapped to the phone as much as you can possibly handle. "
good,Heavy workload. High volume of claims. Lots of expectations and very little room for error. Management in MS is below average. Everything depends on your management and their styles.
good,I enjoyed the holistic and positive approach use with the at-risk youth enrolled in the agency. Management could benefit from using that same approach with it's staff.
good,"Great people, learning opportunities, and ping pong table! Typical day is reviewing recent happenings within the company, and speaking with clients, assessing needs and offering insurance products based on your conversation."
good,"typical day at work was just to yourself come in start your job take your breaks and go home "
good,"Management micromanages every aspect of the company. The other employees I worked with were amazing, however management was not. I would only recommend this job to someone who is just starting to work, but not wanting something long term."
good,"Great image the company gives off when you first start, but there is nothing pretty about the job. Once you start taking a full workload, its a sink or swim job. Kudo's to those few that have a knack for the job or prior experience, but this is not a good job for you if this is your first claims job, or cant handle the stress to meet both needy customer and tight corporate expectations. Beware if you do not advance or promote in your first 6 months, you have a higher chance to become stuck in the entry level role because it becomes harder to manage your workload and have time to focus on preparing yourself to move up in the company. Your workload usually increases and so does the complexity of the claims, but you are still held to the same level of work if not more which leads to time efficiency issues, and eventually the scales tip. Leadership intervention usually leads to tightening your own rope around your neck and overtime you either quit or... you get where I'm going..."
good,"everyday is a new process based on a manager plan "
good,"Fast paced work environment, stressful day to day. Constantly changing processes, not a lot of autonomy. Since I left I have found that they are One of the lowest paying companies at least in claims.  Below industry average"
good,"The training is VERY fast paced. Be prepared to work for the salaried offered."
good,"Very caring company , job can be demanding and you must be a great communicator and able to verbally de escalate situations to bring about an amicable resolution"
good,I worked at progressive after leaving another call center.  At the time it was different than the regular customer service job I had with T-mobile.  Overall it wasnt too bad with call volume and customers calling for insurance quotes.
good,The company culture is motivational but the pay is exceptionally low as far as licensed insurance agents are concerned. There is no commission or overtime.
good,"The role of claims adjuster allows an  individual to gain exposure to business principles and industry drivers that few other occupations provide such insight. Not only the ability to put an evaluation in economic terms on something that at times is intangible, but also being pragmatic in the consideration of the lowest ultimate cost."
good,"Too many claims.  Not enough adjusters. Equals bad customer experiences. Management seemed to care but did not DO anything about volume.  Too many people get this job and quit as it is very demanding.  Everyone seems miserable here.  This could be eliminated with the proper claims software, transparency of leadership and monitoring workloads."
good,The management was unpredictable and inconsistent.  You were constantly being moved to different areas and you never new where you stood with the company.
good,"As an Adjuster handling a medical claim from someone who was recently involved in an accident, I felt the policy holder was owed more attention than what you were able to give to them. Everything was based off numbers, not an individual basis.  At the end, it was very clear that I was just an ""employee"" and their commitment to me was nothing, while I was totally committed to my work."
good,Progressive is a good company to work for. They have decent benefits and their pay is comparable to other insurance companies. The work can be demanding at times & you have to have uncomfortable conversations with people and businesses. There is little opportunity for advancement in Utah or surrounding states.
good,"Good pay and benifits, but too much demand on work load, time away from family and too much mirco-management."
good,"company itself is great.  They were built on the correct codes for life. ie; moral / ethical.  However, be careful who you trust with your own growth in this company."
good,easy day not calls ever holding very well balance for scheduling which helps the call flow. calls usually hold but by 12 its complete availability. They have many flex options.
good,management needs to improve and be more employee oriented. Very sterile environment. Lots of employee turnover due to lack of management. Lots of red tape for any procedure to be completed. Everything goes through headquarters in Ohio wild position it's located in Fort Lauderdale
good,"There are no down days, everyday you have to move fast think fast and multitask. It is a stressful job. The pay is better than most Employers. It is a customer based job so not only are you on the phone all day with Insured members but you must process medical bills, review mail and faxes, call medical providers to request bills, and respond to emails. It is hard to have an unscheduled day off because when you get back the work has added up. Being able to manage your time and workload is necessary yet overtime is usually still necessary."
good,"I enjoyed Working here it def had its ups and downs. Such as being required to make offers of different products. If u did not meet goal every week which is dependent on people actually agreeing to get quotes(renters, homeowners). Nice bonuses at the end of the year."
good,"-Very busy and lots of hours but compensation makes up for it"
good,"Unfortunately, company continues to take small perks away, therefore, after a time you begin to loose interest in high achievement.  I have had the fortune to have great supervisors, but not everyone can say the same."
good,"The job can be a little overwhelming at times, but you have plenty of support. It's a great company to work for and the training is recognized and unmatched"
good,"Progressive as a whole does live up to their values and what they stand for as a company. I feel like they truly do want you to succeed and offers many benefits to their employees to ease the stress. However, in the claims department you MUST be good at time management, be quick, efficient and aggressive to resolve claims. You either sink or swim and the workload is intense especially during the summer. You will have stressful days where you feel like crying..leave work with anxiety.. while others aren’t so bad and most people just want help in a stressful situation nor have they ever been in an accident. A lot of explaining how the coverages work, many people don’t understand how Insurance works and don’t understand deductibles or when you’re investigating liability and coverage. You without a doubt will have upset customers that will call, email, and text you throughout the day along with body shops, other insurance carriers, etc.  Again, time management is everything in this job and 8 hours in a day is just not enough sometimes. Many weekends working, or trying to catch up to stay afloat. Management and your coworkers are always willing to jump in and help where they can but everyone is in the same boat trying to resolve as many claims as they can. You’ll learn to develop very thick skin. I have learned many job skills working in claims and Progessive is always offering training to help you succeed whether it’s in the department you’re in now or if looking elsewhere. I do love Progressive..I am not sure if working in claims you can do it for years to come before you get completely"
good,"my supervisor was with progressive for 15 years before getting promoted, which is fine but not much else potential to move around within even to gain more experience. the work is heavy, never a spare moment. I chose to work through my lunches and work extra hours to stay on top of my workload. customer service, auto claims, voicemails, inbound outbound calls all day, investigations, word processing, state regulation guidelines."
good,"Laid back, work/life balance, can wear shorts to work in some locations, a lot of room to advance, mnagers value your opinion, if you want to work here be prepared to adapt to change on a daily basis."
good,"Progressive was a very good company to work for, however I did not feel like they were very many opportunities for me to Advance within this company. If you enjoy fast pace, highly stressful work environment then this is the place for you!"
good,"Lacks growth opportunity in las cruces "
good,pays very well for the workload given. the company is great with their employees flexibility and personal lives. there is also endless opportunities for advancement.
good,it was a very artsy fun work enviornment. you are on the phones and computer all day. i learned how to multi task and take calls at a very high volume while working well under pressue. i did not care for micromanagement
good,"Progressive is a great company with strong "
good,"Working for Progressive taught me a lot, they are very focused on delivering the best customer service and providing the best service and product on the market and train their employees thoroughly in order to meet this goal."
good,Awesome job. Awesome people. Not too helpful with work/life balance tough. If you are looking for a laid back job this is definitely it. however if you have a family you will need support because schedules are not flexible.
good,"Just like every other insurance company. No reason given when you don't get a promotion you go for. Old tech, makes job more difficult, changing culture, possible consolidation of offices."
good,Enjoyed this job.  Mentored many very young people.  I built good friendships which I still maintain.  Good work challenges and Ok work life balance.  Overall a positive experience
good,"The company is too focused on numbers and 100% accuracy.  Documentation was demanded too much for small changes or items on estimate.  Company didn't care about stress levels or how long it took to the job.   "
good,"fun place to work, good overtime hours, good staff, good management, good coworkers, fair pay, good paid time off, not a fan of the way they do scheduling,"
good,Very good company to gain knowledge in the insurance industry.  Employee friendly place to work.  Company was family oriented and cared about any issues you as the employee may have.
good,"hard but a fun workplace. learned how to care about my safety aswell as others, manage to communicate well with other's. The job wasn't easy stacking orders into right place was difficult but i enjoyed learning how to do things and manage to pull through it."
good,"Organization skills a must"
good,"Workplace culture can be difficult at times when you are receiving either mixed messages or not receiving full instructions. The workers are the glue that keep the agency running. They wear multiple hats in order to accommodate the needs for the agency, families and the children. A great company indeed."
good,Full time litigation attorney covering a large jurisdiction.  There were many protocols to follow.  A typical day could include being in the office or being on the road for many hours.
good,"good place to work."
good,"Love the companies culture and values, some magers jsut dont embodie the values of the company unfortunately.  Thers is not any wiggle room when it comes to schedule and attendance either you have the time to cover time off. Vacation and sick time is all one."
good,Good place but very numbers based. I appreciated the coaching. No advancement opportunity through temp agency Innosource until a year after conversion.
good,"The atmosphere was fairly relaxed but quite busy.  All employees worked together well.  The staff and attorneys were polite and considerate of one another.  Overall, it was a professional and enjoyable place to work."
good,"Progressive is great to its customers, and to its employees.  I highly recommend working for this company.  Beware that the hiring process is slow at best (expect 2 months or longer before you can start)."
good,"Great environment with a ton of incredibly smart people. The benefits are great although I'd say the salary is slightly below average. "
good,They do seem to care about their employees though the compensation is a bit lagging. Also its the luck of the draw when it comes to getting a supervisor or manager that knows what they are doing.
good,"•	Served as liaison between customer and manager to resolve customer complaints"
good,"Slow start mondays and tuesdays. Very busy every other day of the week , very productive , good hours , good pay .great management, rise after hire with in the company , on the job training"
good,"Good place to work, very tenured staff. Management works well with all employees to accomodate time off, doctor appointments, etc. Co-workers great, all very tenured as previously mentioned,"
good,The job is enjoyable and challenging at times.  Most of the employees are a great asset to the company and a joy to work with.  The hardest part of the job is the travel.
good,Large call center setting. Primarily taking incoming calls to obtain the required information to set up insurance claims.
good,"great place to work, felt comfortable with job demands. managers were easy to speak with and someone was always willing to help."
good,"I gained many skills working at Progressive - became proficient in negotiation, heavy workload management, customer service, and I learned the insurance world. My co-workers were wonderful and made coming to work worth it."
good,"Great company to work for because the management is great and helpful. Managers are very supportive, informative, reliable, and helpful."
good,"The company does a lot of great things for their employees. They invest a lot of money and time into training their employees, good pay, and good benefits."
good,"I work with a wonderful group of people.  My manager is great.  Every day is a challenge.  I have learned to work with different groups of people.  Every adjuster has a different level of knowledge, property damage, bodily injury, litigation.  I have learned so much from my time at Progressive."
good,"Inspection and safety inspection "
good,Typical days are 8 am to 5pm but sometimes require extra hours. I have learned all about the auto insurance industry from the claims process to property damage resolution with auto body shops and resolving total loss claims. Co-Workers are great and easy to work with.
good,"This work experience challenged me to grow in many areas including multi-tasking, developing communication skills, and remaining accountable at all times.  Providing administrative support for 4 Legal Assistants and 8 Attorneys kept me very busy, however created some hardships because of some responsibilities at the office switching hands."
good,Good Company but looking for something new. Training was great. They take their time to teach you and get you prepared for the License test. They have great benefits and great staff.
good,"Great management team. There was a lot of variety in what i did each day, ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting"
good,"When I first started at Progressive, there was alot of opportunity to move throughout the company. Now it is very hard to move throughout the company."
good,"typical call center environment, I enjoyed the time that I was there. They  did have a cafe and gym and doctor office on the property which was helpful"
good,"Working within this company was amazing and the many faces and people we face from different ethnic groups is something i would do all over again i have a passion towards helping people and admire our everyday customers just amazing. "
good,Progressive is one large bulding and the make sure you are properly trained and ready for the world once  you hit the floor. great team
good,Progressive is a great company to work for.  The best part of the job always has been the people that work there.  The biggest challenge of working in Progressive is the insular mentality of each department.
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to learn something new everyday that helped me improve my customer service skills as well as problem solving skills
good,"A great first job to have had, Progressive pays very well and has very good benefits. Biggest downside is there is little to no work-life balance. Almost all employees, though salaried to work 40 hours a week, work at least 50 hours in office and take their work home during evenings and weekends. Employees constantly voiced their opinion on high workload, and this was continually ignored."
good,"The environment at Progressive is interesting and fun. There is a large on-site gym, dry cleaners, etc. Gainsharing is generous. A ton of modern artwork (though much of it ugly/unappealing) in every building"
good,Nice location and offices pay is not what it should be for all the work you do.
good,It has been a number of years since I was employed by this company.  I believe the company has restructured the office where I was working.
good,"Provide client with policy information, make changes on policies as require. Deal with client that were upset because of guide lines. Very low co-worker relationship. Management focus customer satisfaction answer phone call in timely managers and solution solving."
good,"Process applications for, changes to, reinstatement of, and cancellation of insurance policies. Duties include reviewing insurance applications to ensure that all questions have been answered, compiling data on insurance policy changes, changing policy records to conform to insured party's specifications, compiling data on lapsed insurance policies to determine automatic reinstatement according to company policies, canceling insurance policies as requested by agents, and verifying the accuracy of insurance company records."
good,"*Multitasking"
good,"Constant interaction with customer via email, phone, and face to face."
good,"I was able to learn a ton, build an excellent resume, while working with a talented group of individuals."
good,I have learned a lot from working at Progressive. I am licensed in all 50 states and have had support from my management the entire time I have been there. My co workers have been instrumental and well versed in what they do.
good,"I love my co-workers. There isn't a lot of movement in California right now, but that will change soon."
good,Assisted with training new hire personnel. Enjoyed working with new employees and the mentoring process.
good,"A typical day was about 10 - 12 hours long but the time flew by.  Success demanded high organizational skills and determined focus on detail.  I learned a lot about myself, my ethics and my professional goals. Management was strick and micro in nature however, they were willing to address concerns readily.  Co-workers were fun and exciting people and Progressive strives to improve the team dynamic with field trips to allow the members time and location to blow off steam and get to know each other better.  The hardest part of the job was the organizational task; the job was ever changing and didn't allow a person to develop a method of addressing the job that would work day after day.  The work was ever-changing and could bring new and challenging factors into play each day.  The most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers."
good,I was not micro-managed by management and the workers were very personable.
good,"Good compensation, great people. Not much room for growth."
good,This was a great job where I learned a lot of different things.
good,Inbound insurance sales representative job.
good,Took incoming calls from card members handled large volume of calls daily.
good,A typical day/week would include things like tactical delivery of projects to strategic planning for our quote and sales applications. I learned that if you give people enough autonomy to do their jobs well they will always surprise you in good ways. I enjoyed highly competent peers within IT and the business side. The hardest part of the job was absorbing an incredible amount of change over the last few years as we focused on common processes across IT in a world with shrinking budgets. Mobile development over the last 2 years has been incredibly exciting. New ways to reach people and increase our ability increase our market share.
good,"Call center work is not for me but this is a great company.  The culture, benefits and motivation are what I appreciate the most.  Call center work is too slow, I need to be not only mentally constructive but physically constructive also."
good,Good company to work for. Pay is awesome! The drive for me was long. But they have work from home option after 6months. Good culture but a bit stressful.
good,I enjoyed my time at Progressive Home. Like many employers today they advocate for work life balance but struggle to balance that.  I had great co-workers that knew what team work meant. The supervisors were always there to help as well but they were overwhelmed too. Unprecedented growth has presented opportunities that are often missed.
good,Working here is ok if you like complicated task and way more work load than the average customer service position. Training was not so helpful in the beginning so in this job you just have wing it.
good,I am assigned 45 claims a week. I have to do coverage investigations has needs. Management it depends on the manager for the experience. Being a claims adjuster is hard.
good,"Toffe collega's,aangenaam sfeer,spijtig geen project in piping meer"
good,I do not wish to complete this session.  I have no negative thoughts about progressive. I enjoyed my time there and once I moved to a new state I had to leave.
good,"Unreasonable and unrealistic daily expectations that will have a perfectionist/detail oriented person go crazy! Nice work environment if you have time to participate in the lunches, games, and meetings..."
good,"Fast paced environment, not flexible, management only cares about their numbers, management quick to place your on warning instead of providing additional training when needed."
good,"Good environment but my manager could have used improvement. Pay is pretty decent, not the highest, not the lowest. Allows you to work from home when necessary"
good,"I enjoy working full time in the Data Center and being a part of the growth the company is seeing. "
good,"Had to leave when mom was diagnosed with cancer. After extensive training and excellent reviews, company refused to even consider adjusting schedule to meet individual needs.  "
good,Been too far remove to critique the current work environment. When employed there workplace very busy. Management was accessible. Hours could be long.
good,"Progressive is a good place to work, nice benefits but unless you know the right people it is next to impossible to advance in the company. I applied for a supervisor role and it was between myself and one other person.  On paper my results and feedback were far superior and I was told I interviewed very well.  I had also mastered 3 different roles whereas the other person had only done one.  They hired him and surprise, he went to school with the hiring manager several years ago.  The demands are inconsistent and if they feel like focusing on your for whatever reason, they can find a way to justify singling you out."
good,Progressive is a fairly decent place to work. They have many different perks for their employees. My experience is not the norm however my experience with management was lackluster.  my first year their my manager had a completely different shift then I did therefore I went a whole year without any coachings and no compensation increase. my 2nd manager aggressively micromanaged every second of every person on the team.
good,"Progressive is a great company to work for as long as you don't hire in as sales. Once you are there it's difficult to leave. They bog you down with multiple metrics that you have to not only meet but exceed in, and if you don't score high on each one, you are basically stuck in sales."
good,Normally you'd clock in and take phone calls literally all day long. Sometimes the call will be repetitive in their problems. Progressive is very forgiving with their break times and is willing to allow you to break them up around your schedule. In the beginning the training is quite informative and thorough. Then you get a weekly coach to help with the details. The hardest part of the job is mediating the micromanagement of your personal metrics. The best part of the job was the work was generally easy and the environment was overall friendly and beautiful.
good,Overall Progressive is a great place to work as a massage therapist. One of the few companies that offer MT's full benefits. They pay well but expectations are high and the work load is difficult to keep up with long term.
good,Great Training environment. Perfect for entry level insurance adjuster positions. Extensive training and support throughout multiple lines of auto physical property damage adjusting.
good,Progressive is a like all other claims environments with a very heavy workload.  You receive support and continuous feedback to be better which is sometimes not always easy.  The culture at Progressive is amazing but is also site specific.  They always strive to hire the best people.
good,Typical day was 10 to 12 hours. Learned to multi task and perform many functions at the same time. Management was hands on with employees. The workplace culture was upbeat and innovative.
good,Progressive is a cool place to work at. As a claims administrator the day may vary from day to day. It depends on the amount of claims that have are assigned.
good,"The workload is immense, however if  you establish your priorities, you will be able to able to manage your day efficiently with good diary management."
good,"I learned a great deal from Progressive including how to be a leader and about my management style.  I learned that everything here is earned and YOU have to make what you want happen.  As with  many employers, my co-workers are the best part of my job.  They keep it friendly, and interesting."
good,"I worked as a insurance consultant, or customer service rep. I was there for a little over a year. Progressive's culture is for the most part pretty good. They believe in a work home life balance and that I liked. "
good,"Typical day at work 8am - 5pm shift. Case reviews on auto accidents, driver and passenger interviews, auto damage assessment. Made liability determinations and negotiated price points with auto-body companies."
good,I enjoy the flexible scheduling. I enjoy the assistance that they provide to help you to get where you need to be. The tenured reps welcome you and help you to enjoy working there.
good,"Long summer days delivering fresh water.  The job itself was a workout, which is a plus.  You get paid to go to the gym.  Great group of guys to work with."
good,"I have been there for 25+ years and have seen a lot of negative changes, not so much with the upper management of the company but more so with the middle management.  in my immediate work group there is a lot of promoting based on who your friends with rather than what your skills and ability are."
good,"a typical day included, interviewing all parties, answering queue calls, accident investigation, liability decision, estimating damages, issuing settlement checks. I learned how to become good at multi-tasking. Management was available if you needed help. Co-workers was the best thing! The hardest part was managing workload, the most enjoyable was the flexibility, achieving goals and helping customers."
good,The best part of working at Progressive was working close to your co-workers. Easy to make friends and they have a very accepting culture. The pay is a little above average depending on what you are doing. At times the work to pay ratio is not very good and you end up doing twice as much work as your pay shows. Management was not very good from my experience. It really depends on who you have though. Overall a good company and fun working there while it lasted and pretty easy to move around within the ranks.
good,"Progressive provides an excellent work environment and good training. However the call flow is over bloated with too many either unrelated metrics or conflicting goals. Unfortunately for the company and each of its employees these lofty and unrelated programs interfere with what should be the focus - selling insurance. For an entry level professional or someone wanting to learn insurance they are a good choice, for experienced professionals or dedicated sales persons (that want to sell and perform a direct function) seek elsewhere."
good,"Job work/life balance depends on your organizational skills because this is an issue with a great majority of the staff. Most associates feel over worked, under payed and under valued. I give it solid marks because as an estimator there is no pressure, just meeting with customer's to tend to their claims needs. I don't have claims lingering for days or the same person calling six times per day which makes what I do a lot less stressful than the file owners. Everything else is about average w/ Progressive. What a majority of the associates will do is get the training and would go to a competitor who pays more with less claims and stress."
good,"I learned alot working with this job, I learned more about how to work in a high volume and stressful environment, I also learned my passion for customer service and being able to help those in need."
good,"Home visits. Foster home visits. Court proceeding. Treatment planning. School visits. Medical visits. Hospital Visits. Case management. Family-siblings court ordered visits. "
good,"I enjoy what I do for Progressive. Having complete autonomy, my manager treats me as a professional thus having a good work relationship and work environment."
good,"fantastic job, great place to learn insurance claims handling. very lean company, not a place where you will be micro-managed. be prepared to work extra hours. customers can be very difficult, and company expects excellence in return for average compensation."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"Very great job to work at, has taught me alot and gave me alot more experience in what i currently do now, fun people and fun work place."
good,You need to be able to work in a micromanaged area. No matter how correct you do the job they find something wrong. You are connected to a headset if you work in the call center and everything is timed to the second. The co-workers are nice.
good,Progressive is a very strong and viable company from which you can expect solid job security. Corporate culture is a little different than local Utah culture and sometimes the two clash. Corporate headquarters being in Cleveland limits management growth unless you are living there.
good,The call center has many amenities to offer.
good,Sell auto & home insurance with different carriers.
good,It was ok just very tedious and I didn't like computer controlling my every move
good,"very fast paced, fun place to work. Didn't pay the best and had high turnover of employees. Biggest downfall was the nepotism and the advancement of the ""bar friends"" over more deserving people."
good,overall good management good learning good day at work great inclusion hardest part is the scheduling at times. enjoyable part is working from home. t
good,Call center was great but claims was not. I learned a lot of great skills that are transferable to other careers. I am thankful for the time and effort that Progressive gives in training it's employees.
good,Progressive is on of the best places i have ever had the pleasure to work. I was not pleased with the staggered implementation of some of the needed familial benefits as they were not in place in time for use during an emergency situation.
good,"Progressive is a great place if you do not want to advance,  you can make lateral moves but they find ways to keep you in the same position.  After trying multiple times to move up with not success I have been stuck in CSR role for 4 years.   Upselling has been added to our job description and metrix have been raised.  If you upsale but the customer doesnt buy it negatively impacts your annual review.  Pretty unfare.  But I just work here... I dont make the rules"
good,"Good company to work for. Good benefits and competitive pay. "
good,"Overall, Progressive is a good place to work. They have the usual cubicle call center environment, and also a great lunch cafe on site. The last couple of years there I saw huge changes in management from the CEO down to team supervisors. This created a lot of instability, uncertainty and general chaos at the site. Lack of job security was also an issue as new staff put their changes in place. Hopefully, this has been resolved in the 2 years since I  worked there, and Progressive has become a great place to work once again."
good,"As a CSR Rep take inbound calls get to talk and help customers with polices all around US"
good,Demands were reasonable.  Environment was not taxing. Management was up front and direct.  They worked with yiu.  This company I feel treats their employees fair.  Seems more make  oriented though.
good,"Great place to work for benefits. They are affordable and the only reason I lasted as long as I did. If you get a job that requires phone work, ie..customer service or sales you will never get off the phones. You can move to different departments but its a call center and you are on the phone."
good,"Daily tasks involved phone communication with customers and checking on status of claims. "
good,"Lots of benefits, paid time off the phones, minimal pressure to convert. If you buy into the company line, you will excel. Lots of training, outstanding year-end bonus."
good,"Hours are long as you are at a desk and on the phone.  Nice, because all calls are incoming.   Set Hours.  Can take a brake whenever you want to but have to equal a total time amount which includes your lunch."
good,"Progressive was great company to work for and exhibits great values, with a relaxed management style that was all inclusive. However the career advancement path was disappointing and included hurdles of which one had no control over. Their ""Guidelines"" Intranet research system was fundamentally difficult to navigate and use. This is very important as this is the main system used to provide information to policy holders. I feel as this systems navigation can be well improved upon"
good,"During my time with the company the office had a friendly environment, very diverse and inclusive. Employees received a lot of training and resources."
good,"Other companies pay more for the same work, its for this reason that I can't give them a better rating.  If they were to increase my pay it would be more competitive and attract better people."
good,"Progressive has a high turn over due to the amount of stress the position provides. When I was working as a customer service Rep. my day consist of more than 60-100 calls a day with well over 50-100 calls waiting and no time to gather your thoughts."
good,"Progressive focuses on its employees and cares about diversity and employees wellness.  There is an onsite gym and cafeteria in the Riverview,  FL office, as well as onsite doctor's office.  The compensation falls short, however.  Annual increases do not seem to fall within the average for the insurance industry."
good,"Progressive is a good place to work for the most part. The manager you have plays a big role in work environment. When there is enough staff, there is some flexibility in schedule."
good,"decent pay, good environment, great management. The cafeteria is very nice, they offer a gym as well. Coworkers are usually great, and how they handle breaks is good too."
good,"I enjoyed learning to do HVAC work, it was a new life changing experience. Sometimes things could get tough but staying focused on the right path to succeed"
good,"relocated to co to work for them and was with them over a year. enjoyed the facility and perks. didn't feel as if I was being compensated enough for the amount of work that is required, especially when other companies that require similar metrics pay more."
good,"Great place to work. Job security, has its on sight doctors clinic and has very low physician costs for employees. Also, on sight restaurants and amenities."
good,"I have worked for progressive for about 3 years. You don't have to deal with harassment here, it's just not tolerated. People are pleasant and helpful. The job is hard, non stop calls. It can get tiring and lonesome because everyone is on the phone, and its difficult to feel connected.  Pay is ok, for the level you are expected to perform at, it should be higher.  Benefits are good but all the healthcare plans have a deductible. I would still recommend the company to a friend, its better than most of the places I have worked at."
good,"In the beginning you going to feel lost "
good,"I started my career at the Progressive Home Office in Ohio. This was a great experience. "
good,"The work was challenging and frustrating at times as you always dealt with people in his/her worst moments, bit the experience was invaluable and leadership was strong."
good,if like a call center environment them this is the place for you. graet pay and benefits. must be able to work what ever schedule given to you. must like sitting on phones
good,I enjoy the organization and the branch where I work. I appreciate the role in which I work; it is rewarding to assist customers and I enjoy the coverage investigations.  I wish there was more opportunity for advancement. I have been here for six years and feel like the pay does not adequately reflect my success here at the company.
good,If you a new person read to relocate you will be able to advance within this company very fast. If you are not and cant move your family around then you are looked down upon as not wanting to advance to the next level.
good,"Solid company with great people to work with.  Limited advancement opportunities in Colorado Springs due to headquarters located in Cleveland, OH.  The company is positioned to continue gaining ground on its competitors and will more than likely surpass Nationwide Insurance as the number 3 insurance provider in the U.S."
good,"The CORE Values of the company are what really makes it stand out. The way they structure their expectations of their employees truly ensures they have the best people on their team! If you enjoy group activities, this place really knows how to break up the monotony of the average ""work day"". "
good,The work can be rewarding but overwhelming at times with the high workload and stress.  There is not much work/life balance with being a claims adjuster.
good,"Good Company to work for, but they sort of forced me to switch to sales after learning and really liking the Claims Contact Dept."
good,"Working at progressive proved to be one of the most challenging careers I've ever had. The benefits are fantastic, and the company is amazing. The amount of training you receive is like none other, however the work is emotionally exhausting."
good,Love going to work and leaving like I was able to put a smile on someone's face for an hour even when they aren't feeling the best. You are always meeting new people of all age ranges and feeling like you helped them.
good,"I would always refer anyone to Progressive it is just time for me to use my knowledge and do more for myself. There were good benefits, onsite gym and cafeteria.  I just feel like I'm ready for more of a challenge."
good,Progressive had a great environment. Everyone was friendly and the training staff seemed to really enjoy their job. Frankly the pay is not worth it in my opinion. It is very tedious work and requires a P&C license. For the pay I would rather do something that isn't quite so mentally taxing. The incentives are iffy at best in my opinion. You don't make commission working in direct sales and the incentives normally consist of being entered into a chance to win some underwhelming prize like 100 bucks for 5 people out of hundreds.
good,They have  excellent  training programs . The only drawback  was the weekly  driving  miles. I was the person  in that office for many  years. I covered  nearly all  of central  South  Dakota .
good,"Good training program, tech savvy company that tries to stay ahead of the curve. Pay is average but work/life balance is not the greatest. Limited opportunities for advancement."
good,"Progressive was a good company to work for.  They look out for their employees and provide flexibility to accommodate work/life balance.  I found it difficult to advance.  There were plenty of opportunities for lateral movements, but not many for advancement."
good,"If you are new to insurance the training program is amazing, great environment for a call center. However, there are too many people for reasonable advancement beyonbd the entry level, many persons waiting for the better part of a decade or longer to receive any advancement or raises."
good,"Like any other job it had its pros and cons. Pro's are that it pays well and is pretty laid back and easy to learn the work. On the other hand, the con's are that it is a very politics based company to work, so just because your a better worker or work more throughout the day than another, doesn't mean you'll get hired (from being a contractor) or keep your job for that matter. They make it clear that there focus there is not on getting people hired in, but rather the employees progress and happiness is most important. I can understand this to an extent, but sometimes being a contractor, which is like a temp., means you get the short end of the stick in the end."
good,I started as an auto physical damage adjuster and they moved into the training department.  I created and delivered training materials to new adjusters.
good,I have worked for Progressive for 9 years.  I have worked in the call center and in claims.  Progressive as a company offers a lot of wonderful and competitive benefits.
good,"I have been with Progressive for almost 11 years and let me say that they have a wonderful corporate culture.  The people who work there are absolutely fantastic.  "
good,At progressive you can anticipate an active and full day.  As a Supervisor you set your own schedule with the expectation of availability to your direct reports (typically 20 employees) during their regular schedule.  You can plan on working 40+ hours a week.  In addition to employee supervision you will also be involved in Lean Six Sigma project work.
good,Team oriented/knowledge basted/skilled supervisors/up to date technology/on sight training/support staffing /outside source benefits/acknowledgement for job well done
good,The people I worked with were amazing.  The work was very daunting (dealing with upset/frustrated people all the time).  Not a job for me.  Some people enjoyed it others like myself didn't enjoy the work.
good,Requires more in way of work than other insurance company's but the work environment is great. The pay compared to other companies is a work in progress as well.
good,"I loved my time at Progressive. I loved the fast-paced energy while working at Progressive. Everyone I worked with at Progressive was great! The only negative was working with body shops in obtaining agreed prices for repairs. To be fair, body shops will always want more money, insurance companies will always want to pay less. if you can negotiate, then you will enjoy your time!  New college graduates will do well at Progressive as college new gradate usually want to ""stamp"" their name on their job and prove they are valuable by working hard. Do your time at Progressive as they have the best training available, then move on to other insurance companies for more money!"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of claimants
good,"Progressive does most things right as far as how it expects employees to interface with customers. Call handling is not a time metric used for your performance, Progressive expects you to solve the customer's problem completely without them having to call back, so that is the largest metric used. "
good,"A typical day at work involves coverage and liability decision on auto claims. I have learned a number of different ways to cover auto claims and how to make the claims experience as easy as possible for all involved. Management was effective, but did not always have the best interest of their employees. Management makes it feel as if there is a class system in place, frequently separating themselves from their teams. The most difficult part in this job is management of volume as a lot is placed on each individual adjuster within the office. The most enjoyable part of the job is the day flies by and there is never any boredom in place. It is a fast paced environment where there is a lot to be learned."
good,Great company to work for. The company has great expectations for its employees and provides great training and development.
good,"A typical day- Claim comes in you have two hours to contact all parties involved to get facts of case. You are responsible for complete file ownership. You may also have to go to body shops to right estimates, or send customers to service center for vehicle repairs."
good,"Overall, this has been a great place to work over the years. It's a wonderful company to work for if you move around quite a bit as there are offices all over the country. Recently there has been some restructuring and there are less and less opportunities for advancement. This usually comes and goes along with the industry and if you stick around long enough, it will likely move in the other direction."
good,"The people you work with, including management, are the best part of the company.  The compensation and ability to advance, especially to different departments, is not great.  We once had a presentation about how our compensation is structured where they admitted our region, SF bay area, was under paid.  Probably something that you should remedy, especially if you are going to tell you employees about it."
good,"Cool place to work"
good,"Good company to work for, but has started to centralize a lot of work into lower level, lower paying jobs."
good,"A typical day at work involves taking call after call all day with little variety.  The benefits provided are excellent.  Management is usually laid-back and supportive.  Most opportunities for advancement are lateral movements with the same pay but different responsibilities.  It is very difficult to break out of the same pay grade, at least in Colorado.  "
good,"Work load is not manageable. Needed to hire more employees."
good,Friendly and informative managers. Excellent training and and diverse work envirnmont. Your individuality is emphasised but growth at the company is currenly limited as all the managers are fairly young.
good,"answering phones and service policies via inbound calls. fast paced environment and ever changing. friendly atmosphere and comfortable, casual dress code."
good,Culture is treat others the way you would want to be treated. Golden Rule
good,"In my time at progressive I felt the company only cared about the customers . Progressive had alot of opportunities for advancement as well. The incentive program "
good,"The culture within progressive is very positive. Everyone treats you with respect and you're allowed, even encouraged, to be you, have fun, and contribute. "
good,Progressive is a good company just not for me and the desires I have for my life. I prefer working with kids but working for kids did not pay so I came to Progressive.
good,"Excellent training classes, they do prepare to succeed in your role.  I was lucky enough to work under great managers who although expected a lot, provided the tools and assistance to help you along the way.  Whether you are in Sales or in Service, you will have stressful days. There is a nice walking trail just outside the building, where you can decompress from the hard work.  There is also a gym with showers, for you to go and burn some of that steam if needed.  "
good,"A typical day includes taking phone calls "
good,"Wonderful company to work, wish I was permanent I would have stayed. Pleasant laid back work environment with room for growth. Co workers are super friendly"
good,Flexible schedule - diverse culture - opportunity for advancement - can be long hours but still flexible work schedule and great benefits. Training is provided.
good,"A typical day of work is answering 100 inbound phone calls and assisting customers with billing issues, answering insurance questions, and adding or removing vehicles. I learned a lot about the ins and outs of insurance.  The workplace culture was the best that I've ever worked at. It was always fun and we always had time off phones for team activities. THe most enjoyable part of the job is the gainshare bonus you get at the end of the year!"
good,"Environment is very inclusive. The salary could be better for the level of stress and work we do. Overall,it's really not a bad place to work for. They are very inclusive."
good,"Good place to work"
good,Very busy place to work but their training program is excellent and they do a great job developing their people.  I would recommend working there if you get the opportunity.
good,A typical day of work consist of dialing out to customers who inquired about insurance. I would find out the needs of the customer then provide solutions for those needs with the needed insurance plan. I learned to listen to what the customer is asking for instead of trying to sell them on plans they are eligible for. Management is relatively fair and helpful when assistance is needed. The workplace culture is friendly and competitive. The hardest part of my job is waiting until I get a customer on my phone line since there are a lot of voicemails and not very many leads on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people that been seeking out health coverage.
good,"- Challenging work"
good,"This is an excellent company to work for; the benefits are great, pay is fair/good, and the culture is progressive (pardon the play on words) and enthusiastic. Mostly everyone is happy to be there. "
good,"I was working 70 - 80 hours per week, and not getting anywhere.  And I am not a slacker.  The Claims were assigned at a pace that is impossible to keep up."
good,Company provided opportunity to enter the insurance business to someone who had never been involved.  Appreciated their willingness to train and assist in obtaining necessary licenses.
good,"What you would expect of a call center environment. Sales were expected at a percentage, but there os no commission based bonus, it only affects promotions and scheduling ranks."
good,"great place to work.  i like pineapples, they are deleciuous. when im hungry i like to open a can of them and enjoy. sometimes i fwhile eating them and its quite unplesant but i guess that what"
good,"You have to be driven and directed, but it is an excellent place to work. I had one terrible manager who treated me unfairly, but he was replaced and otherwise, I was supported by 4 other managers of exceptional caliber. I was very happy in my time there and would be very happy to return to work for Progressive."
good,"Great company to work at. Good atmosphere and friendly people. They offer a gym on site and also a Doctors office on site. Training could have been better, not very structured."
good,"Good: Good training, good benefits, gainshare (x-mas and january bonuses based on company performance). $15+ an hour, more if you're bilingual. CEO doesn't believe in Marijuana testing."
good,"Great benefits with a yearly bonus. "
good,"Great people to work for.  Team environment, diversity, a company that follows the Golden Rule.  Treat others the way you would like to be treated.   Feedback provided on regular basis."
good,"An extremely high volume call center. New systems and guidelines are being implemented at a rapid pace with minimal training and ramp up time. The best part of the job are the wonderful co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the lack of downtime. Once you are clocked in your time on the phone is monitored to excess, up to the minute you clock out for the day!"
good,As a multi product agent you have a lot of responsibilities and get a lot of exposure to many other facets of progressives business.  It is a very competitive work environment and meeting goals is highly praised.
good,"It's a great company to work for it you love the call center environment, 10 hour shifts available. They have a gym, medical clinic and cafe on site!!"
good,"Definitely a fast-paced job. Worked in an area with high retention and tenure. While great for the company, it makes it difficult to advance. "
good,Progressive cares about its employees. They really take the time to ensure you are trained to handle the work that comes your way. As a claims adjuster the workload can be large and many feel the strain however it all comes down to time management
good,A good place to work. Strongly held culture. 
good,It was a typical call center environment. You have people burnout. You have reps that won't get a raise due to attendance issues that are over a year old. You have impersonal dealings as you are just a number. There were so many people that were not getting yearly reviews and raises.
good,Great place to work has good benefits and lots of room for advancement. They have really good training and you never have to feel like you don't know what you are doing because the managers and coaches are very helpful. You always get feedback on how your work performance is. Overall Progressive is a nice place to work.
good,"Sit at a desk and answer incoming calls constantly all day.  Answer questions about coverage, billing, process endorsements, handle complaints as best as you can, but it not, transfer to escalation team.  Has assist line that you can call for help with a policy if you can't find an answer in the info database.  You have to bid on your schedule every year, so you never work the same hours from year to year, which sucks for a person who likes to work the same schedule, but can be good if you're a student or have kids.  The hardest part of the job is getting hit in the face with call after call after call all day long with barely enough time to take a breath in between, and having stats to meet for every single second of your day.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the health insurance benefits and the pay."
good,Basic Call center life. Diversity and Inclusion are big in the culture at Progressive. Benefits & Bonuses are Promised Annually. Most enjoyable part of the job are the team meetings; gives you time to communicate with someone other than customers. Work from home is available.
good,Working in the insurance industry was really interesting. Being there for people when they need assistance to put their lives back together was very rewarding.
good,"I love the staff, they are very helpful and supportive. Customers aren't usually to rude unless its just before or after the holidays. You do a LOOOOOT of work and bonuses are rather hard to get."
good,"My day was spent with a head set on and making changes to policies. It requires dual monitors for the ability to view multiple screens. They have guidelines to follow. Its basically a script that you must follow. Its a bit monotonous, robotic and sometimes tedious."
good,Progressive is a great company to work for.  Though you are extremely busy there is a great support system there to help you.  The hours can be long but when you need time off to de-stress it is given you to.
good,"Love it here. Progressive has a great culture and ethics"
good,"Sales positions now require scripting. It's very repetitive. Managers are great, training is great. Benefits are great. The offices are nice and there are work from home options for some positions. IT jobs pay well and offer frequent options to move up."
good,If you can read and follow directions this is honestly a walk in the park job. You sit down all day and answer phones and service insurance policies for agents and customers.
good,"Call Center environment, fast-paced. Very diverse work place with many personality types. Progressive embraces all cultures, races, religions and lifestyles."
good,"Very difficult hiring process, took about three months to get all of the interviews completed. Enjoy the incentives the company offers. Great staff of employees.  Very strict on requirements to move on to another department.  The company does have a mandatory yearly shift bid that I was not aware of when hired.  Even if the schedule I was given from the beginning was great for me, I would have to bid for it during the mandatory bid one time per year in hopes that another employee didn't out rank me in my performance numbers."
good,"They have an inclusive culture. Not a fan of the new leave policy, but they do things for a reason. It is a fun place to work, and the management is helpful."
good,Worklife balance is nonexistent. The pay is decent and there is so much turnover that the opportunity for advancement is very good for anyone.
good,it was not too bay did not pay very well lots of overtime good insurance vacation was ok . they would work with you if you had any kind of family
good,Progressive is a good job. Supervisors leave you alone and let you do your job. Pay is not very good and benefits are horrible for what you have to pay.
good,CONFIDENTIAL - Is completely anonymous and will not be shown with your review. There is no comment at this time.  Thank you.
good,My typical work day consisted of answering inbound calls to assist customers with there policies. Which consisted of making changes to coverage's educating customers so they had a clear understanding of what there policy covered. My job required me to navigate multiple screens as sometime I may have been required to research a customers question. Working for this company showed me how to empathize with the customer to help resolve there problem while being there advocate. Progressive gave me the confidence I needed to be able to work minimal management. I enjoyed working for this company for the last six years I have met some incredible people. I have learned to value diversity and what others can bring to the table.
good,"-great place to work, life-work balance,great coworkers"
good,A typical workday involves good time management and great customer service skills.  You have to be very flexible with the ability to handle the workload that is assigned to you.
good,This company really did treat their employees well but you also worked very hard for them too. There were plenty of times that we would have to work late and the company would provide food or other accommodations to help you.
good,"Working for Progressive, like any job, has it ups and downs. There are days when 5'o clock roles around and the thought of leaving is nothing but a wish upon a star. There are other times when you are bored out of your mind because you are done with your work before 2. Which type of experience you have can depend largely on a few things; the kind of person in charge of your state, the weather, the number of employees for that state and what state you work in. "
good,"Progressive treats their employees well. The pay and the options to move up within are awesome. However i feel management could be selected better,"
good,"•	Take inbound customer calls ( policyholders, dealers, agents),in order to handle inquiries and transactions for a single line of business."
good,Progressive is a great company to work for with plenty of opportunity for growth and development.  The training is the best in the business in that it is ongoing/continuous.
good,"Compensation was a little behind other companies ion the area, promotional opportunities sometimes seemed pre-determined"
good,"Progressive is a good company to work for.  They have many great perks like tuition reimbursement, flexible work schedules, its easy to request time off or leave for an emergency.  They also strive to create a fun work environment and yes there really is a ping pong table in the conference room and a wii.  Do not apply if you cannot handle strict job expectations and a heavy workload.  Do not apply if you cannot handle people yelling at you because they think they are entitled to something.  Do not apply if a micromanaging style does not work for you.  There are controls for controls and everything is monitored.  Progressive is almost manic about perfection and quality so be prepared to meet high expectations.  This is not a company for slackers."
good,"A typical day at Progressive for me would be checking call center for issues that could be resolved before anyone arrived at the building. It was very important that call center activities should not be interupted. So I would get there at 6:30 AM and do a walk through and deal with the critical problems such as; fire, safety, electrical, lights and HVAC problems. "
good,"Progressive had a very efficient initial training process and continuing education program including very knowledgeable local trainers. "
good,"Progressive overall is a nice place to work once you get through the interview process.  In 10+ years the work environment has changed greatly though and went from a great place to work to just a decent place to work.  Progressive does have a great benefits package; however, part of that package does lower your base pay so be ready to feel low balled.  The Core Values at Progressive are top notch and are held in very high regard by everyone at the company.  I really have enjoyed the people at Progressive; however, some levels of management just don't seem to see the big picture."
good,Loved working directly with the graduating students to help them gain positions at Progressive Insurance.
good,I loved the team meetings and group activities. The company was focused on building good team work.
good,"Very nurturing cultural based company. Great place to work and build good working relationships. Management has a lead by example approach, very hands on."
good,Great place to begin your claims career. However pay is a little lower when compared to other major companies but in the same ballpark as Geico. Excellent training to get you started on the right path. Management team is great. Advancement is a little tough because there are a ton of people waiting in line for that management position to open up.
good,"Fun place to work with great people, many schedule options.  Easy quoting process to use, very user friendly.  Great time off options available .  Fast paced."
good,Typical day in claims is fast-paced with a high volume of work that will require multi-tasking taking statements on phone calls and updating several systems on the computer
good,"Make the most of it. "
good,"Progressive is definitely a place where they are willing to help you advance and train you to be in the position that you applied for. The health benefits are great and other benefits as well. Overall, if you’re okay with dealing with customers from time to time but have a great environment around you, you’ll like it"
good,"If you are seeking a job, and can handle a phone job, then this will work well for you. Especially if you are seeking a remote position.  Many days, I rolled out of bed, and was working 30 mins later from my home.  Overall, the paychecks kept me afloat, but everyone wants off the phones, so a career is possible, but not without speaking to about 50 thousand angry policyholders first. Can you handle that? Do the math. 50K is an accurate number.  Basically that's working the phones for at least 2 years. "
good,"Pros:"
good,Culturally diversified work environment. Workers appreciations greatly honored.Great team work from various projects. Workers concerns always listened and handled according to manner necessary
good,"Company offers benefits to include company match 401k, health, life dental insurance and paid leave time. Progressive is a good company to work for and does allow for advancement."
good,"A typical day of work depends on if you work in the office or field. I worked in both the office and field - the day started early and ended late. I had many call's to return/make, while covering my territory for property damage assessments and investigations. At times it felt difficult to keep up with the ""office"" work while on the road, and the file work while in the office. This is what I would consider the challenge of the position. I enjoyed working with others, having the flexibility of being out of the office, getting work done from home as a field rep."
good,Onsite full gym with showers. Onsite doctor's office. Onsite cafeteria. Life at Progressive was okay. Lots of convenience but some managers need to take inclusion .classes
good,"Nice place to work, lots of sitting and working on telephone.  Mostly computer entry of phone interviews with people involved in claims. Progressive has plenty of training to help you do well at the job."
good,"Work hours are from 8am-5pm daily. The opportunity for working from home is up to 3 days a week. Work environment is positive because of the work from home availability. Great yearly bonus based on company performance, not individual performance."
good,"A typical customer service day with Progressive would be answering incoming calls from policyholders requesting to make changs to their existing policy. Examples of available changes would be to add/delete vehicles or drivers request explanation of coverage and offer options the customer is not currently taking advantage of. You will also speak with Police Officers, City Officials, and Roadside assistance agents confirming coverage and driver information. The calls or back to back primarily during tax season everyone had money and are making new vehicle purchases. The scheduled are very flexible is actually hard to get fired from Progressive for attendance. "
good,good place to work with opportunities for growth. great place to learn about insurance industry for free and develop skills for the insurance industry
good,Great place to work for anyone who is single with no children during the 1st year of employment. Challenging for those with a family due to the scheduling structure.
good,A company that believes in morals and the value of humanity. Worked with the company but a short time but they did make you feel included and valued as an employee.
good,"Progressive has a wonderful work environment. I love the duties of my job, i love the people there. Its easy if you just do what you need to do. I service auto policies eith Progressive. The pay is not enough to live here in the springs, as rent for just a studio apartment is anywhere from 1100/month-1300; which would be almost 50% of my monthly income. The only thing i really would complain about would be that i make a small salary. When i heard what managers make, i was devastated.  I dont know how all the people in my building can afford to live, eat, and pay for bills. The attendance policy is a little stressful. Otherwise its all great!"
good,"-Fun Work Place and Big shop for Insurance Domain"
good,You have to know the system in how to proactively do ur job. Any mess ups could get you fired. Staying on your ps and qs for filling out ypur timetracker and your schedule
good,"A fast paced environment, lots of training and good pay/benefits. The majority of the leaders will treat you with respect, claims is definitely where the money is at, but you'll earn every nickel."
good,Great place to work snd you could learn a lot-it’s a friendly environment and it is very fast paced call center/CSR. Learned myriad of things. Benefits
good,There are incredible opportunities for building your sales experience through a supportive environment. There are many employees whose entire career is at Progressive. The #2 cause for turnover last year was retirement. Lots of training and wide ranges in salary based on performance. Great place to be employed. Not for me as the positions I seek are in Cleveland and I cannot convince my wife to relocate there. Tough hiring process but worth while.
good,"Progressive's biggest draw is the way it treats its people. The wage is fair, and supplemented by many benefits, and this translates to many of its employees - they are, in general, happier working for this company than they would be anywhere else. It is a place of respect, a place that wants everyone (not just the business) to be happy."
good,"My personal manager was very combative with her team and made the day very stressful. While the company has an open door policy, myself and other members of my team bringing this issue to HR and upper management fell upon deaf ears."
good,"- Come in and check email/voicemails "
good,I would not use this information as a basis for any decisions.  My experience with this company is over 11 years old.  From what I read in trade publications the current CEO has changed many of the challenges of the past.
good,"I absolutely loved my time with the staff at Progressive.  Learning a new business line was interesting.  "
good,"Feedback is part of the culture and always warranted to improve across the board. Vital to keep up with emails, things change quite frequently in insurance. Most enjoyable part was showing my superior customer service skills when assisting customers. Worst part some of the customer demeanor were vile but you've got to learn to roll with it."
good,Progressive is dedicated to their employees and creating a great work environment. They understand that claims is a very stressful job and they are always looking for ways to lower the stress and help manage it for employees.
good,"The best way to describe working in subrogation at Progressive is, fun. At least my job was fun. A typical day at work consisted of sending out orders to an investigative company and waiting for return reports; then posting them in the system. Also filling out release forms for paid up claims, then learing new jobs and training others to eventually perform them. "
good,"I enjoyed working for Progressive. I was able to learn and add to my skills. Work environment was great, well cultured. I enjoyed seeing how I could help others and found it gratifying."
good,"Good company however, due to family obligations I need to find something that will accomodate my life change and working on the phones unfortunately, is not assisting my families needs."
good,The company as a whole is a great company.  Georgia is very different compared to the rest of the country.  Most people who come from other states leave the company.  Most people who leave Georgia for other states are promoted quickly because Georgia is very hard on the employees.
good,I worked in the customer service department. It is your typical call center however I feel like the call volume was higher than most. Constant changes are made to team.
good,"Positive work environment where people feel valued and appreciated.Great people at all levels of the company - joining makepositive is like joining a family and everyone is supportive of each other and has a great time together"
good,Fun work environment while in intial training. Advanced training environment depended on your immediate  supervisor.  Depending on who you got depended on how well you progressive.  They each followe their own traiing methid
good,typical day at work taking calls all day. A lot to learn but once you get the hang of it its not that bad. One of the best jobs ive had so far. Would recommend this job
good,"Progressive is a great company to work for. They foster a very positive workplace culture by employing individuals from ALL backgrounds (from fast food to former CEO's). The managers are approachable and feedback, whether it's manager to employee, employee to employee or employee to manager is not only welcomed but often times rewarded. It is A LOT of information to learn but there is also a lot of support and ongoing training to help you. The gain share bonus, dress code (extremely relaxed) as well as the unique scheduling they offer, were the best perks to me. Although, the flexible scheduling is not usually available until about a year after starting. "
good,"Taught me a lot and made me more valuable.Culture was good, work days could be long but enjoyable. Pay was decent and the training was very good. No real complaints."
good,"Great company, terrible customers. Only recommended for people who can let getting yelled at go as soon as it happens. Company does their best to mitigate this and support employees."
good,The job was ok at first but then it started to get really stressful.  The only thing that really matters is your stats and you have poor hours and not a whole lot of time off for holidays.
good,Knew what they were doing they were willing to teach and great a job overall always had work kind and friendly staff provide a great experience learned alot at this job
good,"I love everything about the company but the job just isn't for me The company offered a lot of really great benefits, and some of the customers and managers just make you feel like the best person in the world but call center jobs are never easy"
good,Job is a call center. But good culture to work for and dress in call centers is casual. Fitness center and a food court at larger centers. Lots of training
good,It is a great place to work. A little stressful in the first year IF you have a chronic illness that keeps you in the hospital. You are not eligible for FMLA until you've worked for the company at least 12 months.
good,"The culture is great.  Work can be stressful.  Typical day begins with a review of your workload, prioritizing and creating an action plan to complete all assigned tasks."
good,Progressive is a an ok place to work ; constantly working . Some weeks will be full & elaborate with work .Others withhold a days pay & apologies . You can't work there if you don't comply with others. At any time there could be times when you guys have to work together to accomplish a goal .
good,"I liked working at Progressive but I thought the atmosphere of the building could be changed to build morale. After becoming a supervisor, I was working with a lot of entry level employees. The majority of my team wanted to advance within the company but I felt like the company could use a few more perks (in the building) to motivate people. Maybe providing a free lunch every week or having sport leagues within the company. The hardest part of my last job at Progressive was motivating certain members of my team to build a career within the company. I do realize not everyone wants a career in insurance and working in claims can be very difficult. On the contrary, seeing members of my team enjoy their job and eventually being promoted was very satisfying. I also enjoyed meetings with higher management, discussing how we can improve our claims process. My typical day at work involved coaching my team, listening to calls to make sure they were following our correct procedures and providing exceptional customer service, all while doing this in a timely manner."
good,"Extremely fast-paced and stressful position. Investigating accidents, determining liability, closing claims per goals as set by management and a strong ability to multi-task are some of the tasks involved in performing this job."
good,Good culture with strong management that were always willing to listen to ideas that would help the company move forward. they really cared about each person and their feedback.
good,"Business casual dress code, great work environment.  Most employees stay with company as there are many growth opportunities.  Beautiful campuses, great amenities."
good,"Well run company that treats their employees well.  Great training and pay is per the industry standard. "
good,"There systems appear to be out of date, however the training staff and management are great.  Pay needs to be more competitive especially because the medical benefits aren't that good.  $19.50 an hour doesn't cut it now-a-days.  Shifts are great and the option to work from home after one year is really good. They need to provide employees with a better employee discount on Auto insurance than $50 dollars a month added to a paycheck.  That's hardly a drop in the bucket."
good,"You will be overworked, but you will be fairly paid. Gainshare bonus is guaranteed and rewards low performers the same as it does high performers. This disincentives high performers."
good,"Progressive is a great company to work for, they do special events frequently to help ease the job itself. The job itself is is very difficult and is for a special type of person, often people would not come back without warning."
good,"The claims world is never easy. The people you work with at Progressive make it a fun environment if there aren't any toxic employees. There is a political game but I suppose that's everywhere you go. ""They say"" tenure doesn't matter, but that's contrary to what I've seen.  Usually, you'll work more than the allotted 8 hours and that really affects work/life balance. If you can't manage the work within those 8 hours and ask for help from managers, you're placed on an action plan which counts against your performance evaluation which in turn affects your salary. So, if you're like me, you'll work more than 40+ hours a week. Upsides are being able to help customers everyday and be a positive light when they've just experienced a terrible accident. It makes you feel good doing the work for good people. The negatives are dealing with terrible people and getting surveyed by them, which in turn, affects your raise at the end of the year."
good,"Great benefits package, very flexible work schedule available, excellent training and support for employees, good advancement options"
good,A typical day for me  was knowing every day I would basically be doing the same thing.   I learned how not to treat people. Co-workers were nice enough. The hardest part of the job was not being challenged enough.  The  most enjoyable part of the job is knowing when to leave.
good,High call volume daily. Provides excellent training and licenses where needed. Many opportunities for bonus throughout the year through contests. End of year bonus NICE!
good,Progressive is a great company to work for. They foster an environment that allows you to advance your personal career along with your personal life. I also like that you can come from any previous career and Progressive will give you an opportunity.
good,I love working at progressive very well trained and understand the world of insurance very flexible with working around days you might need off supervisor are very knowledgeable and helps in anyway they can
good,Working at Progressive was awesome! It's truly a great company to work for. The manager are always there to help you with whatever you need and their very understanding when it comes to family.
good,"good work environment"
good,"A typical day includes planning for inside and outside activities. Co-workers are great people and fun to work with, Hardest part of the job is negotiating claims but the enjoyable part is the reward of resoluton."
good,Wish they could provide a better culture that actually fits to the Austin Site. It's very old outdated and just not fun to be there.
good,"Typical day includes taking in coming calls from customers about their insurance policies.  Responsible for taking payments, issuing policies and explaining billing issues."
good,Great company to work for and the people are great. Company in good hands with current upper management. Call volume in call center overwhelming at times but working with great people made it easier.
good,I enjoyed working for Progressive. They had an inviting environment and awesome benefits. Dental insurance included braces and they paid a nice percentage of tuition.
good,"Nice place to work ,good company with a lot of room for  advancement. Pay and benefits  could be  better , but over all a good place to work ."
good,Good place to work with Progressive Insurance and working life is Excellent and coordination among colleague. Atmosphere is awesome.
good,"A typical day would be getting to work 15 minutes before your shift starts to bring up applicable programs. Some days you take calls immediately upon log-in depending on call volume. You can take your breaks as you need to, with the only requirement you have to take lunch in a 45 minute block. Everyday is pretty much the same with the occasional escalation to handle."
good,"Good place to work good people good benefits no commission. Pay for P&C license,not to demanding. Pretty good job for just starting out or if you need a job asap"
good,"Progressive is a great company, overall, with a very forward-thinking culture.  There are great people who are fun, customer-focused, and genuinely caring.  I was lucky enough to work daily with new phone reps for both sales and service, under a manager who was dedicated to continued excellence; which was apparent in the representatives in our department.  My co-workers and I complimented each other's strengths and helped to improve on each of our weaknesses.  The most difficult part of training and managing in a call center environment is the employee motivation due to the innate monotony of the job tasks.  However, this leads to the most enjoyable part of the job, which is looking for ways to motivate and challenge oneself and the employees!  Progressive taught me great ways to do this while maintaining professionalism and customer focus."
good,"First off, they do not drug test ever. This made no difference to me, but I know a lot of people can't find a decent paying job that doesn't do this. Don't show up messed up though, that'll be the last time you do. You get 10min after clocking in to prep yourself for the day, then you get a 45min lunch and two 15min breaks. You also get bathroom time and other such things, but they watch those and encourage you to take care of that on breaks. Management was really nice actually. My boss was super friendly and we would laugh and tell stories. You don't get much time to talk with co-workers and your supervisors though. 90% of your time is on phones. You do get to decide when your breaks and lunches are though. Hardest part for me was the escalated calls. Not many people call their insurance company happy. The most enjoyable was how they knew you were stressed and would do their best to make it a good environment for you. The pay was nice too."
good,Coached / Supervised a team of reps to exceed their metrics.
good,"Great co-workers and managers. Everyone was friendly, and the trainers were very helpful."
good,"typical day at work was answering inquiries about auto insurance policies. Making payments, calling independent agents and providing them support on customer inquiries."
good,It was enjoyable to go to work everyday. Employees were empowered to make business decisions.
good,"great company to work for no work life balance."
good,"The typical day at work for me is primarily focused on customer service, were I take inbound phone calls regarding our insured's policies. The general questions are concerning billing, or adding vehicles and numerous other policy changes. This involves using many search databanks, and guidelines are written separately for each state, so this requires fast reading, extensive knowledge of computer use and savvy customer service abilities. "
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work. I did policy changes and answered billing questions. Some managers were great and others were ok, it was very clique-ish though. That part was one of the hardest parts, it felt like no matter if you did a great job or not, if you weren't someone's buddy outside of work there was no moving up. I got my degree and was told that it really didn't matter. I did like talking to different customers and being able to help in ways."
good,"Is a great place to work, management is very professional."
good,"Progressive casualty insurance agent with a history of surpassing customer and employer expectations. Leverage consultative-sales strengths to identify opportunities, nurture relationships and close deals."
good,"fantastic learning environment, fair pay, bonus in the form of profit sharing yearly.  IT group sees high turnover due to poaching, they on average pay less than national average or even area average salary.  Management is caring, but upper management has made a mess of the division lately."
good,"Good company with lots of advantages for its employees.  8 to 10 hour days. Room for advancement.  Awesome co-workers."
good,"If you get assigned 100 claims, you will work 100 claims, no matter what. "
good,Working at At&t allows you to work with great people while providing services that customers need and want!
good,"My day starts off logging into my computer and phone and is consistent phone calls, emails, snail mail and instant messages throughout the day solving customer issues and investigating claims.  "
good,Progressive truly cares about its employees and customers
good,The workload is a constant opportunity for the company. Objectives are high set. Compared to other companies you are not compensated nearly as well. The benefits are TERRIBLE. Progressive does a great job at hiring great people. The people are what makes this a place that people want to come to work everyday. I have worked under 5 managers and all but 1 were amazing. They do whatever they can to help with your work/life balance.
good,"What is a typical day in the life of a Sales Representative? Long sitting hours, wearing a headset and constantly answering incoming calls in a call center environment. Adaptability is key. State guidelines are changing on a daily basis and you are required to read and stay up to date with the latest developments for each of the states you are licensed in. The work is very repetitive. Your calls are being recorded and monitored by your manager, sales lead and quality department. At least once a week or more (whether you think you need it or not), you will be “coached” side by side, remotely or in a small meeting room. A couple of your calls will be randomly selected for review. You and your manager or coach will have the opportunity to listen to the call and look for areas of strength and opportunity, this process can be tedious."
good,"Great company to grow and have long term career, they are really focused on the employee making sure you are happy."
good,"I started with Progressive at an early age and learned a lot in regards to insurance and management. I enjoyed my career with Progressive and was offerred opportunities to grow and advance. If given the opportunity, I would return to Progressive with new ideals and challenges that would benefit myself and the company."
good,I was very fortunate to have the manager that I had at the end of my time at Progressive. She was very open to us and was fair when it came to dealing to problems at home or at work. She is vert forward and doesn't beat around the bush when it comes to your job and what she expects from you. I was very luck to consider her my friend and to have her consider me a friend at the end of my time at Progressive.
good,"Progressive is very employee oriented. The facility in Rancho Cordova has everything that a person needs to be successful, with plenty of opportunity for advancement."
good,Depending on your supervisor you will either move up in the company or remain stagnant. Metrics are micro managed. Incentives and environment has been the best work Ive ever experienced yet! I meet and was able to network with co workers. Attendance policy is reasonable. Pay is good for entry position.
good,I enjoyed working for this company! I was able to experience new things. I was also able to efficiently achieve goals set outside my work place by learning things from this company.
good,"It was an easy job to learn, and they were very lenient on call times.  Individual managers thrived, but overall the management was lacking cohesiveness."
good,The pay is good at progressive but the hours are not very favorable feels long but job is easy to. It is a nice job to have and it gives you a lot of first hand experience with customers
good,It's been fine. I'm just looking for other opportunities to finish out my career. I had a great manager. They're fair. Working from home is a great perk. Compensation is good and opportunities are plentiful to gain experience and be promoted.
good,I love the work life flexibility of our work environment allowing us to have some flexibility to move or give away our hours and I love our Annual Gainshare it’s a great bonus!!!
good,A good place to work and lots of good people to work with. They really care about their employees.  It can be a lot of fun and also difficult at times.
good,Great hours and great food in the cafe. The management is pretty good. Make sure you save your time off if you want a vacation and DO NOT over use green alert!
good,I enjoyed my time at Progressive. I had good work/life balance and I had great co-workers that knew what team work meant. The supervisors were always there to help as well.
good,"A typical day consists of handling up to 10 auto claims."
good,Very customer friendly company.  Always putting the customers first.  Company has great training and support for continued learning and growth.  The company has great core values and really embraces Diversity and Inclusion.
good,I love my job Progressive is a great company to work for they have work life balance Upper management wants to see you succeed and move up in the company
good,"I worked for a Progressive insurance call center for about 3 and a half years. Management was ALWAYS willing to work with me and were always willing to speak to me about concerns or issues or just answer questions. The attendance policy was holistic (I think that's what it's called) meaning depending on the situation, your patterns, performance, and other factors, you would not be fired for missing work. The compensation was great for the position as well."
good,not at this time- they did all they could to help me but the infection from the neck surgury kept me me out to long -was very thankful for their concern and I tried going back but I believe they felt it had been tolong
good,"Got paid for orientation, learned for about 6 weeks on how to handle what i'd be doing in the office."
good,It was my first job and I liked it a lot. Co-workers were very nice and my manager was the best manager I have ever had. He was encouraging and a great leader.
good,They value training and getting their employees the best they can be. Progressive promotes your career path through training. From medical to damage review to customer service you get what you need and its taught the right way.
good,"Progressive is a great employer. I feel that I have been able to grow both personally and professionally with the company. After having been with the company for over a decade, I feel like I could benefit from seeing how other organizations operate to expand my skills and competencies."
good,"My time at Progressive was a good one. Management were supportive. They were critical, but not demeaning. They guided constructively and always let you know what they sought from your performance."
good,A very busy place to work. Great training and most the management are great to work with. I enjoyed working for them. working as a team member and helping each other was best experience.
good,"Progressive offers flexible work opportunities to its employees.  It is also a diverse work environment allowing employees the opportunity to work from home.  Employees are expected to meet certain metrics on a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis."
good,"Working at progressive was fun and easy, the staff was nice and friendly. I learned alot from working at this company. It wasnt a hard job. The best part about the job was the flexibility"
good,Good place work.A typical day at work was very quit. You have only a couple of people working with you during same time. They assign you to different locations and they assign you a certain part of that location to clean
good,Quality and Assurance that all homes under Progressive Life were current in their Certifications and Compliance.  I was the Supervisor for Foster Homes.
good,"I loved getting this job,felt some Supervisors were fair, learning and teaching was not so good. I loved getting the job and talking to the Customers."
good,"This was a great job for a new professional right out of college. It got you right into the job force. The benefits and pay were decent. Never required to work more than 40 hours. Very flexible with vacation days. Job itself was fairly boring and monotonous. When it was busy it was super busy, when it was slow there was nothing to do."
good,I really enjoyed working there. The environment is tough and you can't have attendance issues but the work is satisfying. You work rather independently but get to collaborate when you need help.
good,"Although I wasn't at Progressive for very long, the wont environment was amazing. The leadership was extremely supportive and openly communicative. A typical day in my role involved talking to customers about their insurance policy, and making any adjustments they requested."
good,"it was a high pace jobm but they paid you for the work you did.  a lot was expected but the compensation was good.  upper management was a pain in the butt, but middle management and employees were very friendly."
good,"Very Laid Back and friendly environment, Great Benefits and good people.  The wages are not that great for living but it is a nice and comfortable place to work"
good,"Progressive is a great company to work for. Many benefits and perks. The position I had was cool and there is much room for growth and advancement. Management and staff were great and compassionate. It felt like a family.  I had to relocate due to family issues and was able to work from home for awhile but there were fewer positions in my new state that would require me to go back to my old state for training and work. Hate that I had to leave but if given the opportunity, I would definitely go back!"
good,Must be willing to adapt to the constant change in expectations of the job.  Focus is more on the companies bottom line than on the work environment of the employee.
good,"Emails, meetings with Providers, reviewing of Stipend Summaries and timesheets for payments, reviewing of Contact Sheets associated with Monthly Expense payments. Meetings with the Accounting Department, Managerial Staff and Department of Youth Facilities."
good,Great place to work with good benefits. Long hours but great team mentality. Company culture is very strong with lots of good training. Working in a cubicle was not for me as I prefer being in a sales position with more time spent out of the office.
good,This was a great place to work for. I retired in good standing. Offered yearly incentives from what the company made for the year. Made sure when I retired things went Smoove.
good,"Didn't see the advancement that I would have liked, but overall a great place to work. Very competitive sales department. Company seemed to be going through a small transition for telephone work force while I was there, so I am sure it is cleared up by now."
good,"There were definitely pros and cons. I thought the culture of the company was something I could stand behind. I had a lot of support from my supervisor and I was thrilled to work for them. Other teams would disagree and advise the supervisors operate on favoritism. "
good,"I enjoyed having great coworkers. The pace was very fast and you had to stay very organized and stick too the direct points of a claim due to time management. I was given a lot of authority and freedom to do my job as long as my reviews of my files were strong. Overall I loved my job and it was hard to make the decision to quit to stay home with my children. However I decided I could always go back to work but, you can only raise your kids once."
good,"Because of my role, my day is spent mostly in the company vehicle making follow up and initial calls to customers, updating claim files,"
good,"This job can be rewarding since you get too assist so many people through a very difficult time in their lives. Our job as an adjuster is to educate, guide and assist the damaged parties. Each situation is something new, a little tweak on a similar situation. Great communications skills and customer service will be a must in this position.Overall I enjoyed my time at Progressive."
good,Good Company to start your career with.  Good training program.  Potential to move up the proverbial ladder if you are not zip code challenged. Very structured system.
good,"Good workplace.  I liked how Progressive treated us employees, and I felt like it was truly a good company.  I simply didn't like getting work piled on with no end in site."
good,Work days are always different because you're speaking to so many different people on the phone. Liked that we could wear what we wanted and the cafeteria was amazing.
good,Has a lot of potential to grow (adding new equipment to meet customer future growth and market demand price points) and expand to meet a special market niche in the industry.
good,"I enjoyed working at Progressive, however had to resign, my mother was ill at the time and I had to be closer to her. The drive 1 way to work was about 1 and 1/2 hours."
good,The job was great and structured but the licensing was challenging for me. We did receive training and the other co-workers and managers were great to work with.
good,"Very high volume work and high demand for quick turn-around time and no overtime offered, unless the company department is falling apart; very stressful environment and deadline driven, which is not a good balance between workflow and hours in a day to complete a list of daily deadlines."
good,Would work for them again. Good place to work gives good balance. Fun place to work give good benefits and schedules are reasonable. 6 month bonuses based on performance.
good,"The pay was ok, not great. Not really enough compared to the cost of living in the Austin area. The culture was amazing though and benefits were really good."
good,I enjoyed working at Progressive!! The workplace culture was easy going and comfortable. Employees are easy to work with and the management staff is supportive.
good,I know its called progressive but they changed the whole sales process by 180 degrees.  They change the attendance policy often.  For hourly they pay ok.  You can't get a raise unless you are in the top half of sales and if you dont they eventually fire you.  Problem is the grading scale is based against people who cheat and get fired.  So we are expected to match the sales of cheaters without cheating.  Also we take hits on numbers for internal issues.
good,Handling claims on a daily basis. These include new claims and claims that you are currently in the process of finalizing. Claims don't go away until YOU get them closed. This can create a very demanding workload before you know it.
good,"As and underwriter I was able to work with clients from all over the country by assisting   them with their policies in ways such as changes, claims, adding or removing benefits asn well s family members to the policy,  Even though the duties were similar, every day was different."
good,"Nice working atmosphere with friendly atmosphere and the managers are also very helpful and cool. We can learn lot of things there."
good,"Fun place to work at. The hardest part of the job is when people yell at you because you did not give them what they want. People do not understand how insurance works, what is covered and what is not, and when you tell them what their policy states, they yell at you, like the want you to go ahead and give you a brand new car."
good,"Days are long and can be somewhat stressful dealing with claims. Leadership opportunities and advancement are great. Management can be a tad overbearing, but the culture and diversity is excellent,"
good,"Progessive is a fun and fast paced company to work for, each day presents something new and exciting. They help with going back to school and many other benefits"
good,"Pay is good, hours and days are not a good fit for work life balance. The culture is amazing, this is a place where you can be yourself. It is a call center so there are days where you will not get off on time."
good,great company. excellent benefits 100% 401k company match (up to 6%).easy work.can be boring because each day was the same. lots of room for growth. friendly place to work
good,Working at Progressive Insurance allowed me to improve my telephone customer service skills to the level that gave me the confidence to purchase the Cruise Planners Franchise.
good,Progressive has a great culture and very open to everyone. There are lots of groups and activities around the main offices that you can become part of to show your support.
good,"I liked working there. Great people. Business growth through customers acquisition using brand advocacy methods."
good,"Decent pay, horrible hours/schedule, overall it was a good atmosphere  and the people were nice, but I just cannot deal with a schedule where you do not get 2 consecutive days off for at least a year."
good,This is a call center and very much a team effort. Lots of support from management and supervisors. Always looking at the best in everyone as the phone calls could be stressful.
good,the work was fine the stress came from the never ending line of calls and sometimes not having the support you need to figure out an issue.............
good,"I developed great relationships with customers and peers at Progressive.  Progressive helped me sharpen my sales skills, negotiation abilities, learn different technologies to get my product messages to my customers.  Relationship building is key to working with Progressive."
good,Working in the claims call center can be difficult.  You would need to speak to people during a stressful time in their lives.  It would be your responsibility to help them through it and help them start to become whole again.
good,"Progressive was a great place to work. This was a friendly, fast paced environment with awesome benefits and opportunities for advancement. I really enjoyed working with progressive Insurance"
good,"Great people to work with! Strong with health and safety. Dedicated management, attention to detail, thrives on 100% customer satisfaction.  "
good,PCC is an okay place to work. I have been here for 3 years and know others that have been here for up to 30 years. I would recommend this job to others.
good,"There are some good and bad things to working at Progressive. The good news is, that once you put in enough time, you get ample vacation time and desired work hours. The bad thing is that it takes a long time to get the desired work hours you want and the way you have to request days off in the current system is dumb. Also, the cafeteria only stays open until 2pm, which is no help if you work until 9pm. "
good,"Job required for you to gather information for adjuster and or new clients to be required for receiving insurance and or claims against an insured . Learned knowledge of aspects of writing reports, gathering information for claims, and filing paperwork. Management makes sure you understand the proper way to achieve your job responsibilities. Team work is required and makes the job less stressful which everyday is challenging daily."
good,"Fast paced environment. After 3-4 months you either sink or swim. Solid training, great team and great co workers. Enjoy the culture I just did not care for the constant work load. No feeling of accomplishment as the task just keep pouring in on an hourly basis. Would be better off as a team claims environment."
good,Great company to work for but taking phone calls can become a pain. It's a boring job and very sedentary. You have to meet weekly and monthly goals for sales even though they say you aren't selling. It's a good job overall of the phones are something you're ok with and don't mind having to persuade ppl to get heowners or renters insurance policies
good,"It has been a pleasure working at Progressive over the past 17 years.  They give you coaching opportunity and allow you to bid on flex schedules. They offer 401K plans, dental and medical plans including vacation time and sick leave."
good,"I enjoyed working at Progressive, but had to relocate to California."
good,Very good company with excellent Mid-level managers who care and are very interested in getting their employees to the next level in their careers.  Great benefits also.
good,"Other employers offer more time off and cheaper benefits, but also a higher stress environment, so Progressive has a good balance.Overall good company and good benefits. Would recommend to others."
good,Progressive is definitely a career and not just a job. The environment is fair and encourages growth. They set you up for success and help you stay on the path for success.
good,This is a GREAT Company to work for!!!. The Leadership Team is completely in touch with the business. This is by far the most employee friendly company that I have worked.
good,Nice place to work for the short time that I worked. I enjoyed working with Christine Moore. I really don't have much more I can tell.  Nice quite place with no stress.
good,Great place to work. Relaxed atmosphere and decent pay. Dress down most days and nice benefits and services offered to employees. Would rec to others as an option.
good,"I enjoyed working for them and they felt that I did a tremendous job for them.  The benefits were good, the compensation was good, and management style was good"
good,"The administration here is very good with the motive of ""true north culture"" . These few lines explains a short introduction of my company .This place is really nice and good to work.I really enjoy to work here."
good,"Great, fast-pace work environment. Welcoming co-workers that really make all fit right in. Opportunities to advance or change department. Great benefits."
good,Great place to work if you can deal with typical office politics and don't mind doing a soul sucking job for decent pay and great benefits. They generally treat the employees pretty well but you are stuck if you get a bad manager. You need their approval to transfer teams or get a new position.
good,progressive is a good place to work for. they have a very good work/life balance and benefits package. I love the progressive culture and how they celebrate different ethnicities.
good,"Job skills learned on the job and within classroom atmosphere with progressive leading the way in the industry"
good,"They endeavor to be innovators (Progressive). While I won't pretend they always succeed, it happens more than it does not. Their work/life balance, casual work environment and people oriented business all work in their favor. They are a large organization and advancement can be challenging. But many feel good about staying with them for upwards of 10 years."
good,steady call volume. I have learned more how to make customers maximize all there savings. family oriented. You can move up in the company after 6 months. The hardest things is getting time off. The most enjoyable thing is the customers in my opinion.
good,High volume structured call center. Work is difficult for anyone who doesn't want to be stuck in one physical position 8 hours a day.
good,it was nice place to work with a gym and quiet room. but i worked from home. only went in on special occasions. the hardest part was when I did have to go in. the enjoyable part was that i worked from home
good,They cared about me as a person along with my carrier and helped me to advance and broaden my skills needed to complete my job. Gave back thru Gain Share payment at the end of every profitable year.
good,Enjoyable place to work if you can deal with a lot of negativity from customers and from co-workers. Training was sparse when I started and ended up being a factor in my leaving but company was proactively working to fix this. Management is a bit rigid but over all is a good place to work. Just have to be able to deal with very aggressive customers who won't admit or tell the truth in many situations and with some co-workers who do not pull their weight and expect you to cover their mistakes. Management is older and fairly out of touch but company is working to rectify this.
good,"Answered inbound calls (heavy call volume) to assist customers with their personal lines account (auto, motorcycle, boat, umbrella, homeowners, etc.) i.e.- adding or deleting vehicles, taking payments, changing coverage's on their policy, underwriting, as well as gathering info from the Department Of Motor Vehicles of that "
good,"Progressive has an extremely flexible work environment and the benefits here are exceptional, everyone is just so nice here."
good,"A great place to work decent compensation hours are long but over all a great place."
good,Fairly high pressure call center with performance goals which were at times arbitrary. Overall a good work atmosphere with good management. Flexible work  schedule.
good,"I like this company, I was able to stay at home with my boys during the day and work at the call center at night. They are great at working around your schedule. The pay was good as well."
good,"I worked as a customer service associate for Progressive for almost 2 years. The people and the company are great, but the metrics are always increasing to where they are hard to reach. Being on the phones all the time is not for everyone."
good,This is an awesome place to work and the compensation is competitive.  There is a lot of room to advance if you are competitive and take pride in your work.  The atmosphere is relaxed and just about everyone is willing to mentor you and support your long term goals.
good,Taking calls from angry customers is totally not worth 15 dollars an hour. everything else was pretty nice. left due to moving out of state.
good,"Overall progresive is a solid company to work for, with flexibility and a laid back environment.  Growth however is limited as there are few lead level opportunities due to a mature workforce so when those openings do occur competition is fierce."
good,"Learned a lot about insurance background.  Company very family oriented.  Great bonus check, great raises. Co-Workers very friendly, great gym facility on site, outstanding cafeteria."
good,"Progressive is overall a great place to work. The standards are high, but not impossible. Most importantly they seem to attract great people so it makes for a great work environment. Management is very approachable and available."
good,good company the most enjoyable part of the job I like is helping others. I learned a lot of different sales techniques and skills
good,I have nothing bad to say about Progressive Insurance as an employer.  If you work hard you will be rewarded.  Unfortunately in the market that I live in there is little advancement opportunity locally.
good,Great company to work for. Good benefits and pay. Supervisors always there to help. vERY HIGH CALL VOLUME. Overall good company
good,very fast pace with a lot of hours always on the move must be very careful a lot truck and equipment traffic co workers are ok managment ok i guess 1/2 hr for lunch
good,"Progressive is a great company to work for although advancement can be slow and limited."
good,good place to work that gives you time to spend with your family
good,"A supportive work environment, that trains you well and fosters its employee's skill set."
good,"High energy work place. There is much to do throughout the day and always and opportunity to learn more. "
good,"Friendly co-workers, great supervisors, awesome incentives and room for growth. Progressive really cares for their employees. Since the job requires you to sit most of your shift, they offer plenty of options to get you on your feet and moving during breaks, before work, or after work. Options include, rec center games, a gym and trails around the building."
good,"Direct management was great.  The hardest part was dealing with corporate guidelines that did not allow for very much independent thinking and problem solving.  However, being able to help people and complete investigations was very rewarding."
good,"My work day consisted of helping customers at the window with signing their paperwork correctly.  I took care of the faxes, data entry, and the mail.  I also copied litigation files and did filing."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"As long as you are willing to move around, this is a great place to start your career. Hard work and results are rewarded. Leadership skills are slowly developed. Great benefits."
good,"Progressive was a good place to work.  Management was great and I enjoyed all of my co-workers.  "
good,"Auto Field Appraiser servicing mostly central Indiana."
good,"Its a good company to work for, that is why I have been there for 14 years.  I work in an all male company except one other female who comes in once or twice a week, which is fine, but being a people person I find that I want more of a mixed group to work for.  I don't feel I am using my working skills and knowledge to its a full use and therefore would like a more challenging job.  I am in daily contact with purchase ledger queries, and general telephone calls and have a good telephone manner and like to give the personal touch to regular contacts."
good,"Loved working for this company- the people are fun, the atmosphere is great and they really are about all their employees. OT is always available and the pay is fair. Year end bonuses were exceptional."
good,"They have come a long way in allowing their employees to have the flexability with their schedules.  Allowing them to work from home, shift when they start their start time."
good,"As with any company your immediate supervisor will dictate your attitude towards the company along with the training you receive. I however did not receive adequate amounts of either. Therefore my day- to- day routine is the best, but the company overall is a good company."
good,Took initial claim reports from the various involved parties and entering pertinent information using Lotus Notes database.  Assisted customers with existing claims and routes customers to correct departments based on their needs.  Educated and persuaded our customers to use Progressive Service Centers or networks shops for the repairs to their vehicles for the benefit of both the company and the customer.  Assisted customers with scheduling appointments for their vehicle repairs.  Maintained records and filing systems.
good,"take incoming calls from insurance customers. answer billing questions reinstating canceled policies, educating customers of insurance coverage for boat motorhome, auto etc"
good,its a terrific feeling helping others to achieve their personal and life goals!
good,"Standard type of insurance company. I was promoted within a year, but the option to advance is completely up to you and the availability of the company."
good,-ever day was new challeges
good,"Great training, flexible, and a good launching pad within the industry. Highly recommended for new members of the industry."
good,"A typical day for me is to leave from my residence at about 7:00 a.m. to travel to my first inspection. I usually travel about 45 minutes to 1 hour from my house to my first inspection. I am responsible for territory east to south-east of Des Moines, however, I travel wherever I am needed. I have worked for Progressive for over 12 years, and I have been a dedicated employee, serving several positions to include Managed Repair Representative, Injury Specialist, and Team Leader. I was just recognized for my rating of ""Excellent"" in customer service, and I feel my rapport with our customers is one of my most important assets. I have learned that respect and courtesy are paramount in customer relations. I get along well with my fellow employees and I have made many good friends within the company. The hardest part of the job can be driving in treacherous conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people through a difficult ordeal, and leaving them with a high satisfaction from the experience. Having been in management myself, I know how challenging it can be to balance the needs of the company against the wants and personalities of the employees. I have learned, again, that respect in dealing with people, along with getting a ""buy in"" on the goals of the company are key in producing positive results."
good,My typical day is review my daily task load and organize it so I can complete everything as efficiently as possible. I drive to the task location whether it is a body shop or a parking lot and complete an estimate for the damages on the vehicle. I then have to make my required status calls for all vehicles in the repair process at various shops in my assigned territory.
good,"it's difficult spending an 8 hour, sometimes more, day on the phone dealing with mostly irate customers. management is very helpful and supportive."
good,"I really enjoy working for Progressive, my co-workers are like family to me."
good,"My typical days with Progressive were seldom predictable. I enjoyed the wonderful people I worked with, learned much from my managers, open door policy with management if something was needed. It can be truly very trying bound to a headset over 11 hours a day. Customer service can indeed be brutal, it is not for everyone. Progressive was very good at acknowledging your hard work. Our office was very modern and beautiful with many windows. The most satisfaction I received in this position was learning laws and rules of insurance in other states around the US. It was fascinating and challenging. The thing I liked the least was the ""occurence point"" system used for all employees despite family deaths, illness, etc."
good,"Very great place to work at if you like a high pace call center. You have the opportunity to upgrade your call center soft skills, customer satisfaction awareness through seminars and trainings- you will gain a wealth of knowledge that will help you through your customer service career."
good,This place has great benefits and an excellent staff of managers. I wish I would not have left for more money.
good,"On a typical day, you log in to your system and phone and start taking calls. You can always count on a new challenge during the course of your shift. It's great to be able to assist customers knowing that you represent one of the best insurance companies. All of the co-workers are kind and willing to share their knowledge and tips. The hardest part of the job is learning to navigate the guidelines to find the correct information in order to answer the customers' questions or resolve a problem. The guideliness are extensive since they must cover insurance laws and rules that often differ from state to state. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you know you have helped a customer save money or get better coverage."
good,"At the start it was wonderful, I could literally work hard and earn opportunity. The work environment was very cohesive and team support was rampant. Prior to my leaving the company had restructured making it more difficult to advance, and was working on slashing raises and benefits."
good,"Being an adjuster can be overwhelming at times, but I enjoyed working in the Harvey, LA office. My co-workers and management made the workday a lot easier. Everyone was friendly."
good,"Progressive is the best company I have worked for to date. The best thing about this company is the people. Management truly listens to you and is supportive. Met the most amazing people while working here, which make the monotonous position bearable. Its hard to get your foot in the door here, the interview process is difficult so that only the best reps are selected. Once your in though you wont want to leave!"
good,"I liked working at progressive.  Good place for long career if you stay focused and meet all your metrics.  Fair treatment and good management.  Pay is good, plus you get an end of year bonus!  I only left because I was looking to switch careers."
good,I worked in the office for about 2 years and then I had an opportunity to work from home.  I think the flexibility Progressive allows it's employees is exceptional.
good,Did not like working Saturdays.  Everyone is willing to help you.  Has a mixed culture.  Didn't like the fact I was timed.  Accounted for every minute of your day.  To many computer programs to log into; can be a bit confusing.
good,"Nice place to work overall,  some of the managers are more laid back than others they seem to change them around alot which is unfair. Paid vacation is accrued time but is a small amount every 2 weeks so it adds up very slowly. They should possibly give employees a week up front and then have them accrue time, as many companies do.  Heath insurance needs improvement high deductible plan. Hours are excellent very flexible. Nice cafeteria and gym. Overall a nice place to work."
good,"Flexible PTO, yearly bonuses, great benefits. They make sure you have all the training and knowledge to do the job well. The environment itself is laid back and comfortable. They gave me the option to work from home after being hired so that was a plus. Only thing I’d say is that there wasn’t enough time in between calls to breathe."
good,Inclusive and friendly culture. Everyone is so helpful. It takes only a minute to see that everyone loves what they do. People are so quick to guide you and show you the way
good,"The sales floor is laid back but also competitive. Management is always willing to help you grow, but it is hard to change department once you are hired into that area."
good,"supportive job culture. lots of room for growth. One of the major benefits was the gain share at the end of the year. Obviously, it could be stressful at times and it would have been nice to have fewer claims."
good,"Enjoyed the team work experience. "
good,"Claims can be challenging, the work load can be really heavy some days but it all depends on your perspective. I learned that I am a hard worker, improved my work ethic, learned to be more accountable."
good,They are customer service oriented. Expectations to succeed is very high. You were rewarded at the end of year with bonus. The coworkers are fun and great to work with.
good,"Great place to work, fun environment, they give perks often."
good,"Had much support and training to find success, continued education was a plus and the opportunity to travel and train in other states allowed for time away from the office and the chance to see other locations best practices..."
good,dealing with customers who sometimes were just in accidents could sometime be stressful. sometimes getting through the information process could be mundane.
good,"-start at 6:45am, taking calls from customer who are impacted by a catastrophe event.  Those calls can be nonstop until an hour before you leave. "
good,"Great environment, upbeat, management focusses on positive reinforcement most of the time. Very numbers driven, can feel overwhelming. If you are a quick learner and can budget your time well then the work life balance is great. Many people work their shift then leave and don't have to take anything home. However, there are several who work 10-12 hours a day just to stay caught up"
good,great place to work. Good management and good environment to work. Lots of work from home opportunities. The job can be fast paced at times but lots of resources to pull from.
good,The workplace offers a lot of incentives for staying active and healthy. They have a clinic and a gym on site. The food in the cafeteria is good with specials and specialties every day.
good,"It was fair decent. Good hours. Good schedule. Plenty of opportunity for overtime. The benefits were beneficial. Had a cafeteria, workout room, and health center."
good,"Even though I work for an Insurance company, it feels more like an IT organization.  The company really tries to have a work/life balance.  The management staff has been great and they are there to help the employees succeed."
good,Great working place great managers and processes in place. No  micro managing and a good team to work flexible timing and allow work remotely a good place to learn
good,It was a great place to work.
good,"A typical day for me is coming in at 8AM, logging in, taking my 15 min read time to catch up on emails/updates and then jumping straight to phone calls. The call volume is usually all over the place and unpredictable. Sometimes you go in and there is only 100 calls in queue or you go in and you see 001 (which is 1,001 calls in queue) and those days are rough..You can except a larger range of angrier customers on those days especially since they are on hold for a lot longer. Like any other call center, you get your wonderful clients and then you get some real jerks. All in all, it's a decent job with decent pay, it just gets extremely repetetive saying the same thing just different versions of it back to back.. A main plus for me is the schedule. It is super flexible and there are a lot of options. Most staff members are wonderful as well. I've met a lot of great friends working here."
good,I enjoyed working for Progressive. Expect a fast paced work environment. This job is great for people easily take and apply feedback. I enjoyed the fact that the environment remained relaxed. You can easily bump shoulders with the CEO in the Cafeteria and she will engage with you!
good,Great place to work- The people and culture and core values made it a great place to work. I enjoyed helping customers and protecting our insureds policies in my tole
good,"Steep learning curve at the beginning, especially if you don't have a background in insurance/ call center environment. Over time though it slows and there is little new training if any towards new skills or advancement. Managers tend to only notify you of new roles/positions if they have already evaluated your performance and think you would be a good candidate for it, but overall they are very reasonable and really try to work with you, and try to make the job work for you as best a possible. The scheduling department however does make decisions on their own and your direct manager can influence their decisions, but not always so you may or may not get the schedule you need. Day to day work is not super stressful, but it is hard to keep work and life separate. Occasionally there are stressful calls but they are few and far between for most representatives that I have spoken with. Co-workers are great and love to help each other out. 4/5 Overall rating, a good place to work but not a career choice in my opinion."
good,"Progressive as a company is wonderful. Benefits were great, lots of paid time off. The downside is being a sales associate, customers often are not receptive to the sales approach Progressive forces its associates to use. Instead of being able to make a simple, quick phone call, you must ""discover their reason for calling"" meaning someone that calls in simply asking for a quote is barraged with questions like ""What's your reason for calling today?"" or ""What has you shopping around for insurance?"" Well, they have to have it. It's pretty simple. They need insurance so they can drive, most people don't want to spend 30 minutes on the phone for an insurance quote. This causes tension most of the time and makes the experience difficult for both the customer and the sales associate."
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere at Progressive.  People from all walks of life.  Company activities, family oriented company.  Pay was very competitive at best."
good,Fair company to work for. My fellow employees were a joy to work with. The work at times could be very stressful as I was dealing with medical claims stemming from auto accidents.
good,each day was exciting. Nothing was ever the same. The fast paced environment and culture created a sense of excitement and urgency that made each and every day special.
good,I have had several senior managers that have been fantastic.  I am just stuck with no near resolution to move to a new role due to lack of head count remaining the same for the next 18 months.
good,"As a former Sales consultant at Progressive, the job is not your typical call center job. It is not a stressful, heavily metric based role. Progressive's core values revolves around servicing customers but as well as employees. They make absolutely sure to take care of anyone working there."
good,"Its a good place to work they have great benefits, like any other place of employment there are good days and bad days but overall good place. Worklife balance seems is there"
good,"This is a call center.  Know that going in.  You will answer call after call after call.  If you're not in queue, there better be a reason why you aren't.  You're micromanaged by your phone stats heavily.  The place does have good amenities such as a gym on site, cafeteria with a chef to cook up whatever you'd like.  Overall its a good place to work."
good,Progressive invests a lot in it's employees with excellent training and incredible work culture. The job itself is difficult and can often affect the way you feel about your career. The customer's you work with have high standards but no knowledge to have realistic expectation which is cause for a lot of upset customers.
good,"They have a great extensive training program. Easy to move around, not as easy to move up. Its a faced paced job that you work with as much detail as possible. the management is not helpful and rarely even available. The hardest part is the never ending stream of incoming calls. The best part of the job is all of the amenities and groups."
good,We had lunches catered and had paid R&R but it was always based on business need.  As an SLA driven work environment we had to balance R&R activities to work demands.
good,"From the interview process, to training, to academy, to team participation. It is a very open and self sustaining environment, everyone is friendly and willing to go the extra mile to help each other and make the customers want a business relationship for a lifetime"
good,"As a contractor, they required a lot of feedback. They wanted to be sure that I would be happy. My managers checked in on me and made sure that I was on track in terms of what I expected from my position. Any new opportunities were presented to me."
good,very positive and team oriented environment; best part are the different kinds of people you meet and the experiences you share(personal and professional)
good,"Great company to work with, many hours available. You can also choose hours and days you can work.work is not hard if you love the healthcare and helping others."
good,"A typical work day consists of helping customer through difficult times. "
good,"Times change and so does Progressive.  When the 2008-2009 crunch hit, adjustments needed to be made.  However for the 9 years I was there, I enjoyed the environment, my supervisors skills, and was glad to go to work, every day.  I would go back there in a moments noitice"
good,"Fun environment with very high call volume. Their new sales process doesn't necessarily work with every customer, but they hold you to high standards. The most fun is talking with new people on a daily basis. The hardest part is the raising the standards you're required to meet and lack of coaching to help achieve them depending on who your supervisor is. Overall the 2 years I was there were very enjoyable."
good,* Quality is the most important aspect. Team oriented customer focused development is the key. Friendly and helpful team members make the environment happier each day.
good,"Progressive is a great company. The only reason I left is because when I started  they were very lenient with schedule adjustments, you could submit to make your own schedule and they'd approve or disapprove but they'd at least make an attempt to work with you; after about a year and a few months in they arranged scheduling by production and it completely through off my work life balance, forcing me to leave. As far as dealing with the work flow, it was the average office's workflow. Lots of busy days but the managers are extremely supportive and I feel honored to have met some of the people I met while employed with the company. The company has great values."
good,"I loved the contact with people I worked with, as well as customer contact. I am a people person and enjoyed educating customers, sharing my knowledge, helping them to make educated decisions and grow and retain the business"
good,"Progressive has a lot going for them.  Our facility had a gym, cafeteria and family medical clinic on site.  Many associates are long term so changing to a family friendly or traditional schedule isn't easy and opportunities to advance without changing business units are rare.  The job is repetitive like many call centers, but the customers are generally interesting."
good,Excellent company to work for..The people were Great to work with
good,"While I Progressive, I took back to back phone calls assisting customers with every day insurance needs. I learned how to effectively use my time to accomplish the most. And I loved how flexible the schedule was."
good,Diverse and plenty of opportunities once you get in the door.  Management was great in my department.
good,"Typical work day was very busy because of strict deadlines and office policies and procedures sometimes of unrealistic expectations."
good,Lots of incentives and contests to keep an individual motivated
good,"I mostly did policy changes and reviews for customers. The work was mentally stimulating and I learned more than I ever thought there was about insurance and how it works. Management was well trained and helpful with a few exceptions. My co-workers were great and the company goes out of it's way to build a team mentality. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the angry and irate customers, but there was an escalation team in case things got out of hand. The best part of the job was the sense of camaraderie and the benefits/incentives."
good,Progressive is an employee-focused company that is well managed and results driven.  Customer retention is the primary goal thru excellent customer experience and connection.  Management does a great job of keep morale up behind the scenes with rewards and recognition.  I have been there 15 years and really have no complaints.
good,I enjoyed my time at Progressive until management and I were unable to come to an agreement due to some family/personal issues.
good,I enjoy doing security. It is one of the jobs that i can truly say that i enjoy.It has its concerns but at the end of the day you can see yourself doing for the long haul.
good,"Great company to work for."
good,"A typical work day would involve me assisting customers with animal claims. Management is always busy as soon as they come in the workplace. The hardest part of my job is learning and listening to each insured to get there issues resolved. I learned that my job will be a different journey each day and I should approach it with a open mind. My co-workers play a big part of my enjoyment at work, we are also laughing and helping each other out through the tough day."
good,"A typical day required of incoming calls from clients requesting auto quotes.  If they were given a good price, sell the policy over the phone.  Great work environment, many perks and great people."
good,Great company to work for good pay and plenty of advancement opps.
good,great work life balance. Love working with the customers and co workers. management was always trying to helpful.
good,Was taking 70-80 calls per day. Responsible for making changes to current policies from existing customers. Payments over the phone.
good,Progressive is a great company to work for. The company cares about their employees. Great values!
good,errific people to work with - smart and hardworking.
good,I like the laid back enviroment. Managers and people are verry nice persons. If you are a person that dont mind been on the phone all day you will love this job.
good,This was the best company I've worked for since the military.
good,Fun to work in office with work at home is an option. They pay well for the size and the amount of training you get really helps. I have been able to advance quickly  since I started.
good,If you want to get your foot in the door this is the place! Yes the work is a lot (claims) but it’s over all a good place to be... Progressive is really growing
good,"Just like any job in insurance claims it is high paste and it is stressful. At my role as an MRR I reviewed and looked at cars and handled the physical damage side of things. I negotiated with shops and wrote estimates in the field"
good,"I was always busy! You must be EXTREMELY good at multitasking, negotiating, and managing your time. "
good,"I loved my time at Progressive and was sad to leave. Great organization and great people. While there are also challenges, overall it's a fair place to be."
good,"I enjoyed my work at Progressive. I was able to work part-time and balance family and work quite well. "
good,"-receive new claims"
good,"High-stress level positions. Call volume (depending on department) is typically pretty high. Most all time is spent answering calls. "
good,The environment was very relaxed yet organized. The supervisors made sure coaching sessions were always available to the reps that needed it most. There were Lways incentives for sales and HHV stats.
good,"Working at Progressive taught me a lot. It taught me a lot about insurance, and they even pay for all of the licenses you have to have when working with insurance. The worse part is the call center environment. There are just rows and rows of cubicles, with TV screens showing how long a person's been on hold.... When you're first hired there's endless critiquing of what you say to the customer. Everyday for about 2 weeks then once a month for about 4-6 weeks and then about once a month for a review. If you follow the guidelines it's pretty easy to advance, the downside you advance to just a slightly better pay but doing the same job just a different version of it. It's very hard to get out of the call center once there. It's like they set you up for failure, you end up hating the job because you just can't get out of it. The pay is amazing, it's easy to request days off and you start off with 7 PTO days when you first start. Work-Life-Balance sucks, there are no breathers between calls and you have timed potty breaks. The bonuses are amazing!"
good,"must love office based setting, there are goals, but for goal oriented people.. you will find no satisfaction at an inbound call center. If you like completing projects, you may struggle, but if being constantly productive helps time pass for you and you like to sit all day, you found paradise. Amazing culture. Amazing buildings. Amazing support. World class company, but the job you get hired into will take a toll on you. Advancement possible at 1 year, more likely after 3 if you focus on that from the start. Most managers have been there 5-10 years. If 40 hours at a desk with florescent lighting is your thing, you hit a gold mine. Must have tolerance for customer retention, rather than customer service"
good,"The position I had at the call center was always busy. Barely had any down time. Some people enjoy that and some people don't. It was a little far from my home but I enjoyed the people I worked with. Cafe, gym and doctor on site is a huge plus too."
good,"As a claims rep, life is stressful and the work keeps piling on but that means there are no slow or dull days. The culture is what keeps this company going. The work environment is best I've ever had and flex schedules are really nice (with tenure)."
good,"At times I wondered if I should have stayed with Progressive. The management there was helpful and they seem to be very caring towards their employees. I loved the feed back from them, and to me that was the best part about being there."
good,"great place to work ,  a lot of growth opportunitys in a short period of time.  great management team, the hardest part of the job meeting dead lines due to claim volume."
good,This was a great work environment that required a high level of multi-tasking and flexibility.  I only left the company to pursue parenthood.  My team was excellent and I enjoyed the complexity of the position and my coworkers.
good,You can advance quickly but are encouraged to take certain jobs which sometimes do not benefit in pay. You do the same work as someone else who gets payed more. The environment and people in the company were great advancement just wasn't there when it came to pay increase.
good,"I don't want to have any review done. I don't want to say or write anything about Progressive. Progressive is a great company to work for if you like to adapt to the constant changes in the company, or if you like to change your schedule every year and is based on your performance."
good,Was OTR driver and switched to local which I very much enjoyed but the 39 miles to and from work every day with the whole route under construction took 90 min each way.
good,"On a typical day you receive up to 75 calls a day related to insurance questions, policy issues or billing problems. Throughout my career there I've learned how to deal with difficult customers, how to overcome problems, as well as how to educate customers and coworkers about insurance. The hardest part of job is letting the customers know that there's nothing you can do to lower their bills or when you're unable to resolve an issue for the customer right away. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help the customer and making their day."
good,"Great company, good people, learned to work in a diverse environment and the importance of customer service. The most enjoyable part of working here is making friends and being valued!!!!"
good,"Let me start by saying I was previously employed with Progressive in another state approximately 10 years ago.  The process both times I've interviewed 10 years ago and recently has been strigent but impressive.   Although, I was not selected after applying in the state I currently live in my experience with the interview process for Claims Adjuster Trainee at Progressive Insurance was pretty good.  The recruiting team provided very thorough instructions throughout each step of the process and the career section on the Progressive website gave an up close and personal view of the work culture within Progressive. My only suggestion would be in regards to the video interview process. I feel that it takes away from the experience. I understand that this is often an efficient and necessary process in many interviews, like for instance an international interview but for local interviews it is a little off putting.   One of the appeals of Progressive is the diversity and work culture.  Video interviews decrease the chances of a that personal connection. Not to mention, it gives people over a certain age  a disadvantage.  Let's be realistic here, not everyone is comfortable in front of a camera or on video.  That factored in with the person conducting the interview not being the manager for the branch you are interviewing for changes the dynamic. Watching a video of a person interviewing and actually interviewing that person face to face can be drastically different and ultimately cause the candidate the opportunity of working for an amazing company as well as that company missing"
good,"The company is growing, there is a lot of room to move, especially if you are able to relocated."
good,great place to work for. great company and coworker. management is ok. alot of micro managing. management is very helpful.
good,"Though I don't work at progressive any longer it was only because taking phone call after phone call of complaining customers was not for me. If that doesn't bother you or affect your mood then this company can be great to work for. They generally put off the atmosphere that they care about their employees and will work with you to make you comfortable. Even though I had to miss quite a bit of work, at one point. their holistic approach to absences and tardies allowed me to keep my position. Also, it pays better than other call centers I knew of and was easy to get several raises within just the first year. They have a lot of employee appreciation events, they try to keep it fun despite that fact you have to take lots of negative calls, and the training is second to none. Everyone who works there is generally pretty open to help you out. Hardest part of the job is handling call after call with only a 3 second break between calls. Enjoyable part was definitely the company and employees....oh yeah..I will miss gainshare!!"
good,"Progressive offers an extensive benefits package. The work environment and flexibility is amazing. The people who work there make the company. The only downside is that the Louisville, Kentucky office is small. There is room to move but it takes time."
good,"Determine wage loss expenses and wage exposures on medical insurance claims. Receive and report statements from multiple customers sometimes simultaneously. Research medical records to classify nature and extent of reported injuries. Investigate coverage via multiple programs such as Lexus Nexus and ISO. As well as, locating background information on multiple people at a time. Analyze medical claims for possible fraudulent items, loss control and recovery as required by insurance policy contracts, medical bill coding regulations and state laws. Review claims independently as well as in a group environment, at the same time as multi tasking throughout various amounts of programs concurrently. All while meeting strict timeframes and keeping an up to date database on each individual claim"
good,"Highly recommended company for a career in Insurance."
good,"a lot of talk about life work balance, not a lot of action.  management style varies widely. casual culture and attire.  very results driven"
good,"At Progressive I was part of an inbound call taking team called ""Blended Glass"".  I was scheduled to take accident claim calls and glass claim calls.  "
good,"Great company, great people. "
good,People always willing to help you and make you feel part of the team as soon as you start working. Was a great place to work wish the contract was longer and managers were onsite instead of being in Cleveland OH.
good,"A typical work day starts with reviewing or daily tasks, Progressive is always changing and new policies are always going into effect so you have to be able to adapt to change. I communicate with customers on a daily basis about their insurance polices as well as sell new insurance polices to potential clients. Progressive has a great training program that prepares you to hit the floor running. Overall I would recomend anyone to work their that enjoys customer service and can work in a very fast paced environment."
good,"Progressive is a great company to work for. They treat their employees very well by having recognition programs and events. Pay is good but the advancement opportunities lack. Moving up through the Customer Service Call Center is very hard to do. Other than that, its awesome."
good,Progressive is an awesome company to work for. Such a positive work environment with a great staff and management.
good,Working at Progressive has been a great experience with plenty of opportunities for personal and professional growth. The company offers excellent benefits. Co-Workers are easy to work with and a great wealth of experience and knowledge. The best part of the company is their recent changes to offering flexible work schedules and work from home opportunities.
good,"I worked for Progressive for 7 years. I came from an entirely different industry and Progressive gave me a chance to create a new career. Working claims is a horrible job in many aspects and certainly not for everyone. The work is never ending, and numbers/metrics are expected by every company. The whole thing is just idiotic- for example: work in a hospital emergency room never ends either, but at the end of a shift, doctors and nurses GO HOME and, to my knowledge, are not chastised for not having certain timing per patient, or completing tasks on a certain number of patients. That said, if you do choose a life in claims, and are lucky enough to be at Progressive, please do not make the mistake I did and think the grass is greener! It is not. I greatly regret leaving Progressive, and the only positive thing I learned by leaving is to appreciate what I had. There is more work/life balance than elsewhere, and adjusters are treated more like people instead of robots than at other insurance companies. However, if you still decide to give up your job, and you are in the Richardson office, I am happy to take your seat. I would never leave again!"
good,--Fast paced environment.
good,Phone sales and service in the insurance industry. Very knowledgeable and supportive management. Great benefits and co-workers.
good,Overall I can say the major part I love about Progressive is they care about your well being and health also worklife balance. They are there when you need them any emergency situations and care at all times
good,Great training and virtual work environment. Great benefits. It did get hard getting yelled at by confrontational customers. Assisted auto customers who already had policies. Had to upsell for bundling or additional policies.
good,Progressive Insurance is a great company for a corporate minded individual. The high expectations and strict rules are worth the compensation and long-term opportunities offered to a dedicated employee.
good,Progressive's work culture is an interesting one that helps breed productivity. Managers and supervisors are understanding and helpful and are open to helping you grow as an employee and as an individual.
good,"a typical day at Progressive is working with customers to make their experience as positive as possible."
good,This job was great and I only worked there for 1 year. Unfortunatly I got sick and missed a lot of time. Because of that I was let go. Will still recommend to anyone looking for a good call center to work at.
good,Progressive is a awesome family oriented place to work. The culture around the numerous campuses is always inviting and inclusive. Everything is black and white no underlying policies you're not aware of from the day you enter the doors.
good,"Every day is a different day and you feel like you are always learning something new. Everyone I work with is helpful and knowledgeable. All or most managers started out at the beginning/entry level, so they understand their employees and always provide great feedback. The hardest part of the job is staying on top of all your work. You're going to get new claims, many calls, work old claims, and very few slow/light days. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to come to a resolution for our customers."
good,I believe it has grown to be a better company over the last few years. When I was apart of the company being a single mother there was no balance. I would have different shifts and was having to switch care providers.
good,Progressive is a great company to work for. However the call center and insurance industry is definitely not for everyone. People generally don't like to have to pay for it BUT when they need you then they are glad they have you. I personally look at it as a great job overall
good,"Great company, great pay, poor work life balance. Claims were 10-12hr days. Can't catch up, they need to hire more reps to balance volume. Otherwise, great pay and benefits."
good,"This sort of call center work is incredibly stressful, but the supervisors try to make the environment as fun as possible. But you deal with constant abuse from customers especially if you are in the reporting unit, because you can't actually do anything to help them and have to just tell them to wait to talk to an actual licenced adjuster."
good,"The people are great that you work with. The training is good, management is good. I would recommend the company to friends and family.  Benefits are great, lots of time off as well."
good,"Investigated, evaluated and negotiated all types of auto claims including injury claims.  Negotiated with attorneys for the claimant's injuries.  Subrogated and arbitrated applicable claims.  Wrote property damage estimates and met with injured folks."
good,"Progressive is an excellent place to work in terms of the community and culture. Respect, honesty, and integrity are part of their core values, and are emphasized in everything we do."
good,"You can take your breaks whevever you want and spaced out however. There was ping pong in the lunchroom, gym, a room for napping, and a annual gainshare which helps out a lot."
good,"Started as a claims trainee, but was thrown into an adjusters position within the first week. Quickly learned to become a PIP adjuster. Great pay & benefits. Excellent company culture. Everyday was something new."
good,"I honestly enjoyed working at Progressive more than just about any other job I've ever had. "
good,Work hard and don't mess around. Jobs get done at timely matter. Very good employees to work with and easy to get along with. Long days make for a good work place.
good,Progressive is a great place to work.  Extensive training is provided to ensure you are adequately prepared for any position that you are hired for.  Management cares about their employees and the benefits are great. Diversity in both background and experience is welcomed and celebrated.
good,Good company to work for. Good people. Great co-workers. Management is very helpful and understanding. As long as you put forth the effort you will be rewarded.
good,"Great company to work for, not a fan of the job itself. call center customer service is definitely not for me. sitting at a desk all day drives me insane. 10 hour work days and 3 days off is nice though, training is very thorough."
good,"Great benefits"
good,Nothing to add great company to work for great benefits.  Need to enjoy talking to people even when they are upset.  Need to enjoy just sitting behind a computer all day and talking on the phone.
good,"If there was one regret, it was leaving Progressive.  Here was my take on working for this company. "
good,"Progressive is an overall excellent company, however it greatly depends on your position and manager how quickly advancement in the company goes. You can progress quickly or it can take years."
good,Paid Training.  Employees have the opportunity to change work schedules to meet family needs.  Work from Home opportunities are available. Company hires from within and opportunities to shadow other departments of interest are plentiful.
good,"The nature of claims handling is fast-paced and stressful. While working here I further developed my time management skills and also had an opportunity to harness my customer service and training skills. The culture is very friendly and everyone from the CEO to your peers is willing to chip in and help out, this leads to a very collaborative work environment."
good,Gainshare is great profit sharing program. This makes up around 20% of your actual income in Progressive. The benefits are great with free MSDN subscription for developers.
good,I really enjoyed working with my team and management.  The training was outstanding and they foster an environment of success.
good,Compensation for job is competitive and the employees are great to be around. Very supportive staff and good holiday and vacation benefits.
good,"Competent and highly trained managers. "
good,"I couldn't be happier working for Progressive. I worked for months to gain employment with this company and due to my relocation to Northern Colorado, I'm in the unfortunate position of attempting to find other employment. Not only did Progressive provide the training and development of becoming a licensed insurance agent, but they provide the support and encouragement you need along the way. The enviornment of the Colorado Springs location is a call center, but you are surrounded by fellow employees (many of whom have been with the company for years) who are always helpful and happy to be at work. Your managers are always around for assistance if needed and let you know if there's room for improvement, but better yet, will simply let you know when you're doing a fantastic job. The hardest part of the job is filling the down time inbetween phone calls, but the most enjoyable is working for a company that you knows values your hard work and ideas."
good,"No complaints, very good work life balance and benefits. Very easy to change your schedule if you need to. They are very understanding and a lot of great people work there"
good,Sales are just not for me. It was a nice break from medical field but not something i wanted to do for a long period of time. Progressive did have many perks and always found ways to make the job exciting and fun.
good,Customer service is a main ingredient in many businesses. It is very enjoyable to assist customers on so many levels.

good,Great place to work! Loved the staff and pay! Really hight call volume. Nothing negative to say about Progressive! They truly care about their employees.
good,"Growth opportunities"
good,Interviewed 3 times and got the job. The process took about 4 weeks. I was pretty much hired on the second interview and my recruiter helped with the entire process
good,"A great job. Loved the enviroment and management. Would definitely recommend as a place to work. They care about you as a person, not just a job to be filled."
good,Progressive is a great company to work for. I felt like it was a huge family. The issues i had at progressive were personal and it was time for us to part ways but if i had to rate progressive as a whole it is an amazing place to work with much opportunity.
good,"I would recommend anyone to apply and try to get with progressive, the benefits are amazing along with a fun but professional work . Don't miss your chance !"
good,"Progressive really focuses on providing its employees opportunities to grow as a professional while maintaining a healthy life-work balance. In less than a year and a half, I have gone from being a New Hire to a Sales Associate, to someone who assists New Hires both in-office on occasion and more often in a virtual environment. The company likes to recognize its employees for all of their hard work, no matter how small the task may seem at the time. I've never been with a company that inspires such teamwork within its offices and also within its communities."
good,Progressive is a great company to work for.  They offer a great benefits package and the room for advancement within the company is outstanding.  I would recommend working there.

good,"great company, great management and benefits, great training and support, opportunities for growth. locations available across the USA, including florida,"
good,The pool I worked had 4 pools and guards who rotate every 15 minutes on and off deck guards are working to keep everyone happy and safe. The pool offers swim lessons and even swim test to swim in certain pools!
good,You will learn the business from the ground up in a structured environment.  The employees are the companies greatest asset but when your value has been maxed you cease to progress in your career
good,The job is mostly self serve with room to control your career. The information is also inconsistent between training and actual on the job performance.
good,"Progressive Life Center is an awesome place to work.... I have enjoyed the learning opportunities that have presented itself, also I am excited about the opportunity the youth have to make a difference in their lives and someone else's!!"

good,I started in a clerical capacity and ended as a licensed agent and claims representative.  I enjoyed the ability to advance with the company.  I left only to stay home with my twins and other children.
good,"Answering in-bound calls for auto insurance rates and sales. I learned to up-sale other products provided such as home insurance, motorcycle insurance, boat insurance & motorhome insurance."

good,"Great place to work , good overtime hours and everybody is really friendly . There is always a helping hand when you need one . there was never a time I needed help and couldn't get it"
good,In my experience Progressive is a great company to work for. They have high expectations of their employees; however they also provide a great compensation package and reward good work!
good,I worked 7 years in the accounting department and that was totally my dream job. When the department was moved to Florida I was transferred to Customer Service department and I worked there for 7 years. Management was very awesome. There was great communication between the management team and our customer service team. The hardest part of my job was the transformation from the accounting department into the customer service unit. The most enjoyable part of my job was the daily fellowship with my co workers. They were like family to me.
good,Awesome Place To Work / Relaxed Atmosphere/ Great Co Workers Great opportunity for advancement / Great Management Team / Excellent Working Conditions / Good Training Program
good,The majority of my employment was at Progressive.  Every aspect of my positions from Data Entry Clerk to Claims Rep to Quality Assurance Analyst/Tester gave me the challenges and confidence I needed to realize my self-worth.  Really enjoyed being employed at Progressive.

good,Enjoyed my time at this company very much.  Great management.  Family life balance with work encouraged.  Free lunches several times in the year.  recognition rewards.
good,its great. lots of fun. awesome times. great place to work lots of benefits.
good,"every day is fast paced. you thrive on handling claims superbly, and in providing each customer with the assistance they deserve. The best part of the job is the customers and my co-workers. The hardest part is the complexity of the claims resolution."
good,"My work in auto insurance has provided me with inside knowledge of the unique business needs and culture of the insurance industry.  Working as a claims representative in auto, I received valuable industry specific knowledge and experience within personal lines insurance.  I have the ability to balance quality and efficiency while multi-tasking and working in a fast paced environment."
good,"A typical day consist of dealing with interal and external customers explaining billing questions, adding drivers, vehicles, and covearges to policies."
good,"Great insurance company that surpasses the rest for good reason. People don't understand the levels we keep for ourselves. After working with other insurance companies and working claims to assist customers is great place for smart, intelligent individuals."
good,Laid back call center where the supervisors allow you to get your work down.
good,Great company with many oppurtunities for advancement. Great place to work and meet a lot of passionate people.
good,"Business development"
good,I learned a great deal while at Progressive. They value their employees which shows in their R&R program as well as compensation. You can work on additional skills just by letting your manager know. There is always a project waiting for you!
good,"Managable workload levels"
good,Progressive is a wonderful place to work at. The day to day setting is laid back and easy going. 
good,"Amazing support staff, They really care about customers and employees"
good,"I loved how the company would provide free lunch, parties,gift to keep up the team morale. The managers are all very helpful and the resources need to assist customers were available. A typical ""busy"" day with call volume and the company would provide lunch for everyone or give away prizes to show appreciation for the productivity of the team/dept.They have gym anf clinic on site for employees and family."
good,"I started out as dictating medical letters, reviewing and comparing medical bills. I moved into being a Medical Claims Representative where I managed and maintained approximately 140 individual claims. I verified medical bills and administered recorded statements from our insureds'."
good,"A typical work day included handling multiple new claims. Prioritizing, task management, and multi-tasking where greatly strengthened. Management was fair, understanding and flexible. My co-workers were really great to work with. The hardest part of my position was logistic planning, as I worked in a highly condensed, metropolitan area. The most enjoyable part was working with great people and no two days were the same."
good,"A typical day at work includes discussing policies with insureds, invoicing, and selling insurance."
good,"There were at least 3 different postions I moved into in a matter of 5 years, which proves there is much room for advancement and growth."
good,"The field of social services has been rewarding. Progressive Life Center has afforded me the opportunity to retain my administrative experience and also expand upon my field experience. This company takes pride in providing extensive training to its employees, to ensure that we remain up to date on changes and updates in the field."
good,"This was a intern position. I learned a lot from Progressive Life Center, I love working with families and interacting with children and see how they are being taken care of. I worked with really good people who treated me as a co-worker and not just a student."
good,"They don't hire enough claims reps, turn over is high. You will recieve around 14 claims per day during peak season.  Many of the managers are new in Austin, leadership is good only because of the Progressive culture but many can be on a power trip. There's no need to micromanage in claims. My manager was reprimanded so the issue can be solved. Love the open door policy."
good,Busy office with super people to work with. Very understanding and communicative management. This is a claims office that handles all sorts of claims from auto to major fire and theft.
good,I liked it. I was in commercial lines which is a bit more relaxed on stats but more on accuracy. Ask every question to Get the most accurate rating and you'll do well.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers.  The typical day can be very busy or very slow depending on the time of year it is. The hardest part of the job can be getting licensed for P&C.
good,A great company to work for with amazing opportunities for you to grow your career. Insurance isn't going any where and Progressive is is sure to be a leader  in the industry years to come.
good,everyone was like a family and loved doing things together outside of work environment.  The office enjoyed keeping the day fun. Management was always fair and honest with their employees.
good,I only worked for this company a few months but for the short time I was there it was a nice place to work the people were nice the job was easy and I could have saw myself working there for a while but another opportunity came up.
good,I learned a lot about the claims process. Management was cordial. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people nationwide during one of the most difficult times in their lives. Just knowing I helped make a difference made my heart fill with joy.
good,"I really love what I do, but, we have been heading in a different direction as a company recently. The 'processes' that seem to change monthly, are getting in the way of the adjusters taking care of the customers. In turn management is forced to take time out of their days to micro manage these new changes, causing the process to bog down even worse. This is not only hurting moral, but causing the turnover of those who really WANT to be there, helping out our customers."
good,Collecting the trash.running to pick up and checking plastic container.but most of all I loved the job and was eager to do my job.i got sick and I was hospitalized for that so then I couldn’t perform my duties
good,Most claims jobs are very demanding and would say this company is above the norm in the insurance industry. There is very little room for advancement. I would recommend the company.
good,Great place to work.  Can't say anything bad about my time there.  I left because full time employment was a priority for me and my family.  ...........
good,Great place to work. Really enjoyed the environment. I would recommend anyone to work here. This job experience was very informative and life changing .
good,The day started with receiving your assignments and contacting your customers. Inspecting the vehicles and writing fair and complete estimate. The worst thing about working there at the time was the micro managing. The hardest part of the job was all the changes in there claims system and documenting even the most meaningless items. The most enjoyable thing were the people you met and worked with.
good,A decent job. They have good managers. The pay is ok. theycould do a better job at promoting people. overall good job. Would like a better position. You can make a career here.
good,"Days are usually very busy with a positive work environment. "
good,Good place to work.  I have been there 13 years.  There is room to advance if you are willing to relocate.  Very progressive company that values employees.
good,"this is a family friendly company to work for. If you have a goal of getting into management, this is not the company for you.The pay is okay, could be better."
good,This place was all about training and making you feel prepared for your career.  Training was a six week course that actually netted you a certificate from a local college at the end.  Work flow varied and there was a lot of opportunity to learn new things and give feedback.  Loved it here.
good,Provided accurate response in regard to coverage and options that insured has with their policy
good,"Progressive is extremely flexible, vacation time starts accruing right away, 401k after a month, everyone is very friendly, opportunities for advancement."
good,Progressive is a great company to work for however they underpay their employees for the amount of work they perform and the mental anguish you endure
good,"Worked inside and outside adjusting claims. The training is second to none for all levels and areas of adjusting. Upper management was very good but some of the supervisors were a little out of their element. Most all employees got a long and still have friends from when I worked their over 10 years ago. The job is stressful and the higher your certifications were, the more work you received but not done equally throughout the office. The relationships with other reps and friendships that were built."
good,"I don't want to leave a review. I liked the job, had to leave for personal reasons. My health was poor and the job was too stressful for my health according to my doctor."
good,"Awesome owner, guaranteed 40 hours per week, option to work weekends, i enjoyed taking pictures of the automobiles/motorcycles,homes,boats we would insure, commission a huge plus"
good,"It is a great company to work for and you'll many employees working for Progressive for over 30 years. Growth in career is slow and promotions don't happen easily. But if you are a motivated worker, you'll succeed with ease and be a shining star in no time. "
good,"I love working here. My coworkers are supportive and I enjoy what I do. Everyone here wants to see the business succeed, so coming to work everyday is a blast."
good,"Progressive Insurance is a very fast paced work environment. First line management is not dependable & not trained enough to adequately handle needs of their assigned employees. Progressive is prone to eliminate positions without any notice, once the profitability level becomes strained for the company. Gainsharing bonuses were always a plus. Work load was never balanced with employees life balance."
good,Working at progressive is an enjoyable experience. It's a company that promotes advancement. A typical day is coming in and answering calls to sell policies.
good,I learned even the lowest person on the team can still make a huge difference to the team.  Giving 110% is the only way to work for a ccompany.
good,"I enjoyed customer contact. I was very happy there. We had a good team, although I didn't make friends there. I was older than everyone else."
good,Employees were treated with respect and professionalism at all times.
good,"Great company that offers challenging work in a fast-paced environment. Great workforce, but difficult to balance home with work life."
good,I currently manage a team of 20 that take both customer service and sales calls.  My favorite part of the job are the people and culture that the company portrays.
good,Progressive is a great company to work for! They make sure work/life balance is favorable to each and every employee. I would recommend Progressive to all of my friends.
good,"Progressive is a wonderful company to work for. I have been contracting for over 8 months. The workplace is a good environment they keep the employees engaged, company events are always fun."
good,I enjoyed working there. I is a very good company. There is a lot of advancement opportunity as long as you are doing your best. The work is challenging and never boring.
good,Progressive is a fantastic company great benefits great people however my particular manager lacked a lot of skills therefore my manager made the job they're less than desirable.
good,For me this company has been a fast paced learning environment that values integrity and doing the right thing for its customers.  The work environment brought is one I haven't found anywhere else.
good,I would highly recommend Progressive as a great place to work.  I would still be working there if the commute were not too far for me.  Fair compensation for the job.
good,"Progressive is a great company to work for! The benefits, culture and management are amazing! The workload is very heavy and the business hours are late."
good,A typical work day consisted of about 80 calls. The calls ranged from billing questions to coverages. I learned how to stay patient and show empathy with angry customers. I also learned how to cross sell effectively. The best bestof the job was the connection employees shared. The hardest was making sure you pushed your self as hard as you could to make your quotas.
good,"I loved it, I just couldn't get past sitting all day, and the training could've been longer.  Moreover, I wish that it paid a little more and offered more extensive training."
good,When I first began it was an amazing experience. After time the standards for pushing sales calls was increased. Had to leave due to family issues. Recommend this job to anyone who does not have issues sitting for a 10 hour work day.
good,"Overall, I found that Progressive had a treat your employees well and they will work well for you mentality. However career advancement can be difficult unless you are willing to relocate to different states."
good,"Typical day included managing a caseload of up to 250 claims. "
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working for Progressive as a Claims Adjuster but the workload can sometimes be overwhelming. I work on average 10-11 hours a day and still feel like I do not have enough time in a day to complete everything I would like to. The company is a fantastic company and most importantly I love the open door policy to be able to openly speak with anyone in the company no matter the role. Everyone works as a team and it is not competitive in a sense where someone is better than you. Everyone has been through the hard times and knows how it gets and is willing to help in any way they can. The job work/personal life balance to me is rough because I know most adjusters go into work early and/or stay late every single day to stay on top of their work. I myself go in around 7:45-8 every morning and leave between 6-8 every night. I love the work itself. It is just like every job. It has its ups, it has its downs, it has its good times, and it has its bad times."
good,"Hard work, but rewarding."
good,I believe this job is a great entry level position. Everyone is so happy to be at work. Very helpful. I only wish that they paid more for being such a competitive job.
good,Good company to work for.  Good benefits.  Good job culture.  Management was not of the leadership type.  Did enjoy the work and the people I worked with.
good,"Progressive- great company, easy to work with, clients love the company, cheap on auto. Fast service and take care of claims like no one can. Customer service, customer service, great customer service."
good,Progressive Life Center is a non profit human service agency. They change lives and have the evidence to prove it. It's a great agency and all staff are team players.
good,Great place to work that provides many great opportunities to grow and enhance within the company. A good place to come and enjoy great staff and the leaders support their staff as needed.
good,"The only opportunity for advancement are if you meet a certain criteria. 1 Have to be female, 2 Have to be from a certain country south of the border and 3, you would have to be of a certain orientation. This is not coming from a sour employee, rather from a disappointed one who has been with the company for years and has seen the culture change drastically in the past few years. This used to be a great company to work for. Used to be. Now they want to be  number 1 industry and are willing to sacrifice the Core values and belief system that they were based on. Customer Service means nothing to the management. Sales is all that matters."
good,"Progressive is great company that has good core values. They really are very flexible with scheduling for people who have to balance work and outside activities. I think it's a good stepping stone for people looking to gain new skills, but I'm not sure long term though. I have had great rapport with management and established many friendships with staff. The job can be redundant at times but it's a pretty good job. The only area that could use improvement is the opportunity for advancements and more competitive pay when promoted. Outside of that I've had a pleasant experience with progressive and think highly of them as a reputable organization."
good,the life of a claims adjuster is really busy.the more claims you close the more you will receive.overall theough its a solid job
good,The company has excellent packages and compensation.  The most difficult part of the job is the constant influx of new claims and the pressure to close existing claims.
good,"Come in and get login to phone, to start the day.  Cannot be late by more then 12 minutes.   Then start taking calls.  The calls would be either from the policy side or Claims side. Policy side would usually be an issue with software or they computers would not be working.  The work from home agents would have network issues.  I would document the issues and then resolve their issue or escalate ticket to the team that supported that platform.  For claims rep it would 9 times out 10 be a computer issue.  Would do a safeboot on their system and if that did not correct issue would have to send them a new laptop.  Sometimes the issue was their air cards  were not connecting to the providers network and they could not access Progessive software.  Would walk reps through the steps to reconnect or do a reboot and then reconnect.  If could not resolve they would have to call back when in a Progressive Claims office and we would reinstall the software."
good,"-8 hours on the phone "
good,"overall great place to work. cant really complain about much. I have a good relationship with my supervisor and leadership is generally pretty involved in development. You do get little perks like gift cards and rewards and recognition programs are available. Everyone who works here is actually pretty nice. Potlucks all the time and there are always little work events. They really do try to make it a fun enjoyable place to work. The job itself is a lot at first but everything becomes second nature. As with any call center... its their way or the highway. However compared to stories I have heard about other corporate call centers, Progressive is actually very reasonable. They do want quality and efficiency but you do get time to assist with callers and not to rush the off the phone. You are micromanaged, but not to the point of madness. I suppose people have been fired for not developing or meeting their targets etc... but you do get a good amount of time to change your ways. Leadership tries to develop you to get you past your challenge rather than just letting you go."
good,I enjoy my job due to the fact that I work with a large variety of people in the insurance and automotive industry. My knowledge about automobiles and the insurance industry is vast. My manager and co-workers are great to get along with and I enjoy working with them and seeking their advice. The most enjoyable part of my job is the flexibility in my daily schedule. I work and travel to different sites and can choose where and when to see and give estimates to each vehicle.
good,"Productive and experienced place good in technologies."
good,"Enjoyed the ability to work for a and employee caring company with continuous training and great benefits. Assisted customers and agents with business needs, processing payments and changes to policies. Love working and helping to resolve issues, help to maintain customer relationship with company by providing professional assistance."
good,It is a great learning experience and the company really cares about employee advancement.It has an astounding career development department and gives a lot of leniency with metrics and attendance however you have to do your job.I enjoy the environment and the progress I've achieved there.
good,"Lots of potential to move into new roles but the interview process is tough.  Challenging and busy. Not boring. Almost everyone starts on phones, but potential to move is up there"
good,Supervisors were amazing to work with. They always kept us motivated. I enjoyed the quarterly events with upper management. There was always incentives for doing overtime.
good,"Great environment with amazing co-workers. Training is top notch and the Gain share bonus is an amazing incentive. Management is the key, it can help you develop or they can work towards getting you out the door."
good,"Extremely busy, fun, can be rewarding but if you do not perform at a high level, you're very rarely recognized. The work life balance is difficult but the culture is great! There are a few things I didn't agree with but overall it is an Excellent place to work and begin a career"
good,"Progress insures employees are satisfied in all aspects of the business.  The job is challenging,  but they make sure that you are trained, mentored, and coached for the job."
good,The leadership is great and the coworkers are awesome. The pay and benefits are both pretty good but the time commitment to the job can be overwhelming. Some people work 50-55 hours a week in the office or they are taking their work home and working on their own time.
good,Good place to work for and office is clean and work supplies are readily available to everyone. Good working relations with co workers. Time off is almost always approved.
good,Overall it is a great place to work. They give you the opportunity to move to different  levels and departments within the company. It can be stressful at times dealing with the customers.
good,"Call center is one of the hardest jobs. "
good,"This was a company of Home Health care I know it has the same name of other company of insurance. However, they have the same name in common but type of work is very different. therefore, Progressive Home Health Care job was the type of job that emphasis in a plan of care. If you follow all the instructions given by the nurse everything is gonna be fine."
good,"Great place to work"
good,A great place to work at with a winning culture. I left for reasons that had nothing to do with the way that the business was ran. If I could go back now i would.
good,"The coworkers here are all amazing.  Progressive's culture and work environment is wonderful. They promote from within and usually around a year into the job, if you doing well.  Management really makes an effort to advance you into any department you want to try out."
good,"Call volume is high but as far as call centers go, Progressive is pretty great. In the commercial auto department attendance expectations and/or disciplinary action is largely holistic and based on patterns of behavior rather than set in stone. This can be a good or bad thing depending on how you approach it. Breaks times are left to your own discretion which is great. Also, additional time (within the range of an extra fifteen minutes or so) is given for coffee/bathroom breaks needed outside of your standard break times. Meals/snacks are provided frequently. Training is ongoing. Help is almost always available when needed. Morale is very good for a call center. "
good,"Competitive, but fun. Advancement could be limited based on interviewing capabilities. High turn over in customer service due to stressful environment."
good,They were very relaxed but undergoing a lot of changes with schedules in a call center makes life difficult when you are trying to go back to school. Good managers that cared about you for the most part.
good,"Overall, Progressive is a great company to work for. The culture is great and the guidance and training is outstanding. If you can keep up with the fast-paced environment of handing claims then its a great job. Hard to advance if not in the right place at the right time."
good,Need to attend daily Stand up meeting and Learned a lot of things from Progressive. management is very good. Workplace culture is Very nice for any developer
good,"The greatest appeal of working at Progressive is the strong commitment to work/life balance.  Change occurs very slowly, and the environment is quite relaxed."
good,It was a great place to work. I was a passenger in a car accident which caused health problems. I did not qualify for FMLA. Inbound sales was not that hard due to the training was excellent.
good,One of the best companies I have worked for.  Excellent infrastructure and management team is incredible.  All the processes are streamlined so very little time is wasted.
good,"Great training, benefits, flex-time, etc."
good,great company great benefits fun job functions good people to work with good hours and locations job can get stressful at times  high call volume and nice people to work with family envionment

good,"I was only there for a year, but it was fun and rewarding, I enjoyed the team and all the folks I worked with. It was fun and truly good energy in the department I worked in."
good,"This is a great company to work for.  The environment is the leading factor.  The pay compared to other companies is below average; however, there is talk they may move to salary.  There are several lateral moves that must be made before advancing. The leadership is very very good!"
good,"Licensed agent for Progressive Insurance. Austin TX. call center. Calls are rapid and one must stay focused, cheerful, informative and friendly while answering questions. Ability to ""close"" the sale and complete the new customer introductions to their policies."
good,"Progressive is a great place to work and grow. The available training, workplace incentives, culture and diversity are all excellent. The work/life balance would be difficult to match."
good,"Answered incoming calls. Processed payments and endorsements for our customers. Received my 2-20 while working here. Became team leader, so I took all the difficult calls from customers. Got along well with co-workers and supervisor. Pay and good benefits were good. Hardest part was having a baby in day care. So became a stay at home mom for a while."
good,It a good job but is boring is no calls are receive our costumers coming in there is nothing to do. and sometime u have to be alone in the office other then tham i liked it they moved fr from home and i couldn't go.
good,There are many there that have been with the company for a long time. this shows that they earn and keep there employee loyalty. this is a great place to grow at.
good,Work Life Balance is not great. Needs improvement in that department. Auto Insurance is a tough job however Progressive as an hold is a great company.
good,"I love books and have many years experience as a bookseller.  My time with Borders exposed me to other areas, product lines other then books.  I worked as Cafe and HR manager, working up scheduling, interviewing, hiring, and working various areas in the music department.  I particularly enjoyed merchandising, where my creative side was unleached with the seasonal window displays I created."
good,"inbound call center, great morale boosters, intensive training, good salary."

good,loved talking to different customers each day
good,Great place to move up through the ranks. If you work hard you can be very successful.
good,"Progressive Claims was a good place to work. They were very flexible with my schedule when I had to take classes at my university during the work day. They paid very well and if you work full time then you also receive gainshare - which is their yearly bonus. During a typical work day I would process paperwork, order office supplies, and handle customer interactions and questions."
good,Loved working for Progressive just missed direct contact with people. I wasn’t a fit for a call center but Progressive does EVERYTHING to set you up for success! End of year bonus is INCREDIBLE as well!
good,Great company to work for over last 5 years. Very impressed. High level fast pace and rewarding. Excellent training program. Being a field specialist with autonomy to complete job.
good,Must follow strict guidelines on each call and meet certain “sales” goals for home and renters insurance referrals which is not really clarified during interview process. Overall Great company.
good,Progressive is a great company. I have never been apart of such a driven and successful team. The compensation packages they offer are fair and the culture that is cultivated is empowering.
good,Fast paced work environment. Constant training and coaching to ensure we are able to handle all calls and resolve them on the first call. Work life balance is fair.
good,"Great workplace culture, flexible attendance policy. Great Benefits, annual gain-share offered around Christmas time.  High call volume but they do have a great R&R Program to keep you motivated."
good,"Great place to work. a lot of great benefits, I would tell anyone to work at progressive. no discount on car insurance. A lot of room to grow in the company"
good,"nice place to work nice people and great things to do and great discounts, Nice commute great mangers and fun there is nice people around and everyone has a lot of fun"
good,"Very busy from start to finish checking voice mails and returning calls in a timely fashion. Working newly assigned claims and following up on previous claim to resolve in a timely fashion. Assisting my supervisor with escalated calls. "
good,"The drive to progressive was difficult. Traffic was horrible each day. Yet, the job it self was great. The environment was clean and the people was very nice. I learned so much about car insurance , and how to adapt to a companies policy changing often. There was always someone there to help when needed. The only thing I wish was more opportunities of job growth within the company."
good,It was a great place to work. offered yearly gain share.  On a typical day you would receive sales calls if you called out is do to you promising a call out no cold  calls. Was able to get 50 state licenses numerous training's. Progressive is big on diversity and culture. Most enjoyable part of the day was the friends I was made.
good,"For those people new to insurance, or veterans from other professions ,Progressive has options for you. I would recommend Progressive to anyone, good company to work for."
good,"If you are the type that likes to work hard - Progressive is the place for you!  If not, don't bother applying.  The culture is employee-driven, however it is a fast-paced employer.  Everyone works on over-drive."
good,"nice place to work.  Friendly staff.  lengthy training.  Lots of nice perks like on site gym, on site cafeteria with fresh made food and salad bar.  Gated parking lot and security guards actively around the property."
good,cares about you as a person. job can be stressful at times but if you work hard and follow the process you will be just fine. need to get all your days work in before you leave for the day.
good,"Call volume is high, but calls are relatively easy to handle and there is no metric for length of calls.  Great resources for finding answers to customer issues.  Flexible breaks and lunches controlled by employee. Relaxed work environment."
good,Progressive was a great place to work. The team was supportive. It was a fantastic place to learn a trade and skill that I was able to propel myself to another position.
good,Progressive is a great place to work. It’s extremely competitive to get in so if you do make sure you stay. The management is very kind and willing no help.
good,"The position had did have a lot of work, but management was always there for support. The environment is also very fun, laid back, but you are still expected to do your work."
good,"I learned all about auto insurance policies, I have to say the training was pretty thorough. "
good,"Culture is great.   Great benefits. Management is great, they seem to really care about their employees. Work load is high & can be stressful depending on what position you are working in."
good,It's a great place to work I am just not able to move up at this time and likely will not be able to for another year. I am not at a point in life where I can afford to remain in this position for that much longer.
good,I enjoyed the job I was doing when I retired.  I enjoyed the people that I worked with and the Company is always growing which is a great benefit for future opportunties.
good,I left progressive because there was little room for advancement in the department I was in. I went to another insurance company and within a few weeks realized that I made a huge mistake. If you are lucky enough to get a job there don't think the grass is greener at another company it isn't. They really treat you very well.
good,"Progressive was the best Call Center Job I've ever had, the company cares about the about there employees and there success in such a way going to work never was a hassle or stressful i always wanted to be at work, i learned the insurance game in terms of different laws in different states, learned that people can be passionate about there insurance coverages and also put the upmost trust in us as a an employee to make sure they are handled with the most care, management is tight but fair and always are available for communication in ways to make the work environment better any chance they get, workplace culture was very humbling and relaxing, other employees were always were warm and welcoming to making the work experience as less stressful and productive as they possibly could while staying on task."
good,"The company offered a great yearly bonus, came right before Christmas. The company also rewarded top performers through out the entire year. You could earn extra pay based on your performance."
good,"Progressive has a very fun, friendly and unique environment for their employees to be in a healthy, fun and relaxed setting while producing the best results on behalf of the client in providing A-1 sales and service strategies. Best price, best service and awesome benefits for both the employees and the clients they serve."
good,"Progressive is one of the best companies you can work for. They are family oriented, customer service based and provide quality customer care."
good,"Very holistic balanced work/life culture."
good,My bosses were excellent to work for. Felt more like a family than a job. On a daily basis we handled customer's files and ideas to produce the desired print materials to their specifications.
good,I enjoyed my co-workers.  Company is hard to get into but much room for advancement once you're in.  Some positions have little work/life balance though.
good,I was a work from home Agent and it was Awesome up until I got a new manager and pregnant. I had a high risk pregnancy and my new male manager had no consideration of my condition didn't even accept my FMLA saying it was to late I was already fired. Awesome place benefits culture but management not all bad apples just a few rotten eggs
good,"No qualms with Progressive whatsoever.  Solid company culture with good management.  Work/life balance was just okay, but that's the nature of the beast when you're talking about an insurance claims organization."
good,Progressive does a great job taking care of their employees with competitive salary and opportunities to advance. Progressive truly cares  for their employees.
good,"The management works with you to find the best solutions to issues. Overtime is available, but you are also allowed to leave early, at times. "
good,employees encouraged to have a life outside of the work place and were provided with tons of amenities and perks that brought you back each day. Corporate seems to have the best of intentions.
good,"Progressive is an excellent company to work for, so long as the supervisor or managing person is ""properly"" trained to handle the volume of it's employees under that person's supervision and coaching, etc. The training and furtherance of education is readily available and free, so the problem is hiring and training the persons in charge, so that the employees can work to their full potential!"
good,This is a great company to work for that tries hard to make sure its employees are welcomed and have a nice work life balance.  Pay is good for the market.
good,I enjoyed working at Progressive however i did not enjoy the selling aspect of my job. I much prefer the customer service side of things. They provide excellent training and benefits.
good,"Progressive has a wonderful culture"
good,Progressive is a great place to work for they always place their clients ahead of everything. They always believe that the customer should always walk away happy.
good,"So far AWESOME JOB!!! I LOVE WORKING FOR PROGRESSIVE!!! Training comes with a lot of information to take in, but so helpful to learn so much about Insurance...Progressive really cares about their employees and customers.. You don't see that a lot with most jobs..meeting other new employees is awesome, especially if you're new to the area! Overall great job"
good,"Working at Progressive is fabulous if you can get in. The only department I don't care for is the recruiting department. They could care less about you. I resigned due to health problems. Since then it's impossible to get rehired. I have even got state licensed to increase my chances. The recruiters need to go, they do not care about applicants like you or me because they have a job and they take Progressive for granted. Anyone that works at Progressive and hates it is stupid. I am all about providing virtually perfect customer service what Progressive is known for. I love this company with my whole heart and want to retire there if I can get back in. Progressive is the best!!!"
good,Progressive Insurance is a fast paced environment. The management is great. You have an extremely large workload and you have to be on top of your game to keep up.
good,"Fun job culture at Progressive Insurance. Typical day as a claims representative can be hectic. 8 hours on a headset M-F. Every minute counts at your desk. Workload is manageable if you retain the knowledge and training during your three month probation period. Management is extremely helpful when in need of a new perspective. Co-workers are diverse and friendly. Hardest part of the job is managing your workload in the claims department. Very demanding, but also very rewarding. Most enjoyable part of the job is the employees you will interact with."
good,"Overall a great company with a strong commitment to the satisfaction of their employees. Unfortunately the work load is unmanageable for most of the employees which causes a high turn over rate. When employees quit it creates more work for their already overworked ex- coworkers. "
good,"Progressive is a great company to work for. They have good benefits, and a positive work environment. I was not able to grow with them in the time I wanted to, but they do have a number of different opportunities to choose from. They have a onsite cafeteria during the week,a gym,and a health clinic. They do a great job with promoting wellness there."
good,"A very good company to work for at the time.  I enjoyed the position and the people I worked with and interacted with both within my department and the whole branch office.  Had a good rapport with plaintiff and defense attorneys.  "
good,"Progressive is a great place to work with great benefits and pay. However I worked in the Call Center, the hours weren't good, there was cross-management and the environment wasn't for me. Any other department would have probably been a better fit."
good,Dedicated workers.  Management team willing to provide advancement.  It was a great work environment with a family-like atmosphere dealing with a challenging client population.
good,The clients are great!!! There is plenty of opportunities for advancement!!!! You can build up sick + vacation time!!!! Plenty of overtime available!!!!
good,"I would have stayed here forever, but the company closed the individual branches and went to satellite office. Great compensation packet."
good,"Taking inbound calls I learned how to have excellent customer service skills and how to build rapport with my customers. My co workers were team players, and the hardest part of the job was when we had high call volume and attempt to take every call as well as being productive with our calls. The most enjoyable part of the job was the end of the year bonus, when all the work you had done paid you back."
good,Thoroughly enjoyed the Progressive family atmosphere as well as the management style.  I learned that insurance investigations are much more intricate  than criminal investigations.  A typical day might include completing an Examination Under Oath or two.  A canvass of neighborhood for a stolen vehicle.  Perusing data bases for information on our insured which will substantiate possible misrepresentation or  fraud.
good,Progressive has a ton of opportunities for advancement as well as a wonderful work environment. I love the people I work with.
good,Extensive training and on-boarding for the first few months. Then out to  the floor to sale.
good,"Great work environment with a relaxed and positive feeling.  Exceptional benefits including on-site healthcare and a full gym.  The company went above and beyond to create fun and unusual activities for the employees including carnivals, hot dog lunches provided by the managers and fun and games.  Overall, a GREAT place to work!"
good,"I loved everything about this company. The managers were very hands on and helpful. The compensation is amazing for the type of work I did as a contact center specialist. The training is outstanding. And you get off early enough to still spend time with your family. I really wish I could work there again. I am in school now, so it wold be difficult to balance both. But it's definitely a great company to work for."
good,"22 years experience in insurance sales, claims, management, training"
good,"Very Busy, Not an 8-5 job, must be ready to put in the hours to get the job done. Very rewarding."
good,"A typical day I would be assigned multiple body shops or locations to  assess damages to automobiles, negotiate with body shop personnel  and claimants, and assist Claim Representatives in resolving liability decisions on claims. This position required strong self accountability and motivation as the position was in the field with limited supervision. You must rely upon strong communication skills, quickly adapting to new situations and learning new information to be effective."
good,"I worked with Progressive for over 11 years as a senior operations analyst. I was responsible for 10 offices located in the central Florida area. Each days work was determined by a combination of office needs, ongoing projects and work demands."
good,Progressive is a great place to work.
good,"My day is determined on how efficient and thorough one can be. I have learned to become meticulous in all things that I do while combining facts from all sides of an incident in order to make a unbiased decision. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fulfillment of assisting others. Though no customer is the same, I take pride in giving great customer service, multitasking, and investigating an accident to make the best sound choice within good faith."
good,-Answer between 80-100 calls a day
good,"Great place to work for, but when I was hired, there was a rumor that most people get weeded out after 5 years, and yes, this is true..be careful not to transfer to a department that is new!"
good,I enjoyed working at Progressive very much....it was challenging.
good,"Loved my years at Progressive Ins. Company. I was part of the new era for Progressive, made great friends and find it to be a very stressful place to work, but I've never been afraid of hard work. I hear things have only changed for the better, and I am very happy to hear that. Still keep communications with my co workers. It was not my choice to leave Progressive, lets just say it was a less than desirable manager I had."
good,"While working for Progressive i really did enjoy my time there. this was a cmpany that was willing to show and explain the work, not just through in something you are unfamilar with. also i was able to take the knowledge of what i have learned at other jobs and bring my flair to add to."
good,"I loved working for Progressive. Unfortunately, my spouse was transferred to Florida and I had to leave my position."
good,"Est ce que il y a des avantages  sociaux, on se sens respecter à l'agence."
good,"The best company I have worked for so far.  The company really takes care of their employees, my current job is not the best, you have to deal with a lot of very rude people when handling inbound calls."
good,"Great place to work with many different opportunities (corporate, claims, sales,, etc) and great culture.  Data driven company that strives to be the best."
good,"Progressive was a wonderful place to work. The management was very supportive and reactive to any issues. The training program is spectacular and I felt very prepared to handle the job after going through the program. Expect to work long hours, but the compensation and opportunity for advancement make it worthwhile investment of your time."
good,This was an internship straight out of college. They were very flexible with me and in the end was a great stepping stone into another career. I felt like the people I worked with were competent.
good,Very good work/life balance. Great and supportive management team. relaxed environment with a positive and upbeat work environment. Room for growth and can move up quickly if you put the work in.
good,"Great company and benefits. It's claims, so a stressful work environment. good opportunity to move around in the company and also move up.  Stressful environment no matter in which role you go into."
good,"A typical day involved communicating with customers, claims partners (outside adjuster, body shop, rental car company) to make arrangements for car repairs and gather additional information regarding accident. Very good experience. Opportunity for professional development and growth, especially if willing to relocate."
good,"Progressive is a great company. The big downside is that it is a call center job and if you are on the sales team than it is also a sales job, so a combination of two commonly thought of as bad jobs. Sales side, the job gets super repetitive, service side you're going to be spending most of your time investigating what is going on with an account."
good,fantastic company. generally you take calls all day trying to sell insurance. if you go into the home side more will be asked of you but it makes the job a lot more enjoyable. lots of flex options for your work day and extremely easy to schedule time off.
good,"Progressive was a great place to work (as IT at least) I would have never left if i didn't move out of state. The people were great, the benefits and pay were above average and the end of year profit sharing was generous."
good,"As a liability claims adjuster it is definitely high volume and stressful. Your organization skills will be tested. If you don't like arguing with people 8 hours a day, getting yelled at by claimants and customers because they have to pay their deductibles, or because  they don't have rental coverage, then this job may be even more stressful. If you can separate work from your personal life and understand that it is just a job, then you will survive. Progressive has a great culture, they love to use numbers to help identify issues and provide coaching as necessary. In my experience the way they coach is definitely more friendly than other places. If you try hard it will be noticed, and if you put your time in there will always be room for advancement. Progressive is definitely on the higher end of pay for being an adjuster, plus they offer decent bonuses. Not a bad gig."
good,Great place to work and good way to build relationships with people. Learned a lot of ways to operate insurance and help others. The most enjoyable part of the job is to hear the customer's excitement once they revive their policy.
good,"Resigned for financial reasons to be able to cash out my 401k due to an illness but I would go back in a minute."
good,"I worked mostly with kinship care department - when a child is placed with a relative caregiver.  A living arrangement in which a relative of a child, who is not in the care, custody, and/or guardianship referrals to social services, providing support for the well-being of the child due to family hardship.I was responsible for providing in-home comprehensive assessments to provide safety, crisis intervention, counseling, skill building, financial assistance and provide referrals to additional resources as needed."
good,"Progressive has a great work environment with lots of diversity and great leaders. The most enjoyable part of the job is people that work there, I have learned a lot about managing my work load as well working with a team."
good,The one thing I will always say about Progressive is that they hire the best of the best! People in this industry are go-getters and high achievers. Usually super resourceful and high energy. I loved it!
good,The environment is great. You are encouraged to give your opinion and feelings on daily workflow and how the processes affect you which is good because it actually causes change in the company. They are big on community involvement and contributing to the same as well as the military. They do things within the departments that incite a family/community feel and getting to know your peers. The work depending on the department you are in can be a lot and sometimes stressful or overwhelming. Overall good but can take a lot of your time if you let it.
good,"So many departments, you could move around and grow and constantly learn new things.  Many amenities like a fitness room, gain share, great benefits, mentorship programs, education assistance, etc.  Casual culture with work from home options."
good,"It's a job.  there is room for advancement but only if you are perfect and it is grueling to stay ahead of thousands of other salespeople.  If you can't take the heat, do not go near this place.  If you can, you can really thrive there.  The pay is good and the benefits are adequate."
good,"A great place to work, but it can be very stressful.   The atmosphere is generally positive, with attorneys helping each other out.  The pay and benefits are generous."
good,My overall experience was great unfortunately with the mid year schedule change I had conflicting times with schooling. The culture at progressive was very welcoming and made you feel at home.
good,A typical day at work you come in and work the claims assigned to you . Very independent place to work unless you don't complete your work on time then you are monitored constantly.
good,It’s been an amazing learning experience for me. Insurance is a beast unto itself. Progressive is a great company and appreciated the job opportunity while I was deciding whether to return to the medical field.
good,"a typical day at Progressive was dealing with customer issues and taking payments, the management team was very supportive, I was able to learn in an enriching environment and friendly people. would recommend this company to everyone that has the opportunity to join them."
good,"The culture was fun, fast paced, a lot of training and ways to increase your pay at Progressive. Team environment. Great managers who cared about you as well!"
good,"Great company with excellent employee incentives."
good,"Laid back workplace, easy to talk to coworkers. Decent training but it was great that the licensing was paid for. They try their best to accommodate a work life balance in times if need."
good,"Its a call center environment which does provide a variety of ways of entertainment. It has a very positive outlook and environment, people are very friendly and willing to help when you ask them to. Most people just want you or anyone else to succeed."
good,"This company is one of the best places I've ever worked. The atmosphere and work place was busy, professional, fun, and the continually trained us to be the best sales reps in the insurance business."
good,Get into work and check email. Checking trouble ticket system and list all the things that need to be done that day. Check all incoming and out going equipment and make sure it is all logged in properly. Start delivering the PCs and any trouble shooting that needs to be done.
good,After training we answered calls in the Commercial Insurance Group either updating policy information or creating a new policy for a new customer. We worked with agents and directly with customers.  Learned a lot about the behind the scene of insurance customer service.
good,As a customer service representative you are required to handle a great deal of information. After six weeks of training and another six weeks of performing the job I have a great deal to learn. It can be incredibly stressful at times. What's great is there is so much support. I'm never alone and can ask for help. This company will work with you to get you where you need to be. If you don't like speaking on the phone this is definitely not the job for you.
good,I love working here. Its tedious but worth it. The benefits are great and the flexibility (for my position) is a plus. My coworkers are extremely nice. My managers are cooler then the other side of the pillow.
good,Great work/life balance although the customers that you have to speak to will treat you extremely rude with back to back call volume.
good,"- Great work-life balance"
good,"Great coworkers and team. The Company environment and culture is amazing. Always busy and supportive growth."
good,Progressive is a great company the driving distance is the only problem I have with the company. Co workers and management were great. very easy company to work for.
good,"My work day mostly consists of teaching an array of group fitness classes and personal training. I also get to interact with fitness center members throughout the day, talking to them to find out their goals and struggles so I might help them complete their workout. Additionally, I may simply engage them in conversation to build a rapport. My manager, coworker and I work together to create an inviting and non-threatening atmosphere. The most enjoyable part of this position is getting the chance to help people achieve their goals and realize their true potential. If I am able to help one person, I feel that I have done my job!"
good,"I have been at Progressive since I was medically retired from the Air Force. I recommend the company for those who have the need for work with literary no experience. I liked the company, but a phone representative job is not what I'm looking for as a career."
good,Great company to work for but I am driving over 2 hours to work.  Working for the company is very relaxed but professional and they take very good care of their employees
good,"Incoming calls, assisting potential customers with their insurance needs. Best part of my job educating the customers. My co-workers were amazing people to work with. Loved the facility. The hardest part of my job was being on the phones for 8 hrs."
good,"I really love the people I work with, the company is solid and the culture is encouraging...but working claims is more intense that you are probably envisioning. The work never ends, there is always too much to do with not enough time. You should expect to stay very late and even come in on weekends to maintain your sanity. Claims never really end or stop and they are usually simply distributed as # of claims by # of employees on staff that day. So, if there are 100 claims that roll in and 10 people available? 10 claims per person. Whatever doesn't get done today needs attention tomorrow, and whatever you don't get done tomorrow rolls into the next day. The snowball effect is bad and you can end up with a seemingly impossible workload very very easily. Intense is an understatement."
good,"Many Opportunities within the organization."
good,"8am to 5pm"
good,"-Room for advancement"
good,"Progressive was the most refreshing employer to work for; advancement came to those who earned it; excellent management - individual correction came in the form of ""opportunities."""
good,"A typical day at work was taking inbound telephone calls during my entire ten hour shift.  I learned about the casualty insurance in the auto industry.  Management was great.  They really appreciated the work that the team put out.  My co-workers for the most part were of great assistance to me.  If I had a general question, my co-workers would lead me in the right direction.  The hardest part of the job, was getting cursed out by angry policy owners that called in the call center.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a great group of individuals."
good,flexible work schedule
good,Good place to work. great work environment. Good training. Good work/life balance.
good,I love my Job and everone who i work with i just wish that i recived bennifits
good,"Take new auto claim assignments, take statement, review coverage, complete scene investigations, estimate property damage, gain agreed price to repair damages with the shop. Meet with injured parties, review medical bills, settle injury claims."
good,"The job itself was a fantastic job. Every day you got to come in and help people learn about their own policy, solve their problems, and sometimes just help them make a payment. The management team is amazing and is willing to work with you on just about anything. The co-workers are extremely friendly and a lot of the senior co-workers have been there for 15+ years, which says a lot about the company in a whole. The hardest part and the most enjoyable part of the job were one in the same. Most individuals worked four, ten hour shifts. Which was nice because you usually got to have three days off (usually two together and one separate), however, ten hours a day on phones can sometimes be cumbersome. Overall though, the job was an excellent job that I enjoyed a lot."
good,Progressive is HUGE on their family. They are a very diverse company to work for which is great. They are a really great company to work for and i am grateful for all they have given me.
good,Progressive's Austin site has a great group of diverse and talented people. Managers work with their reports one on one and support them in their efforts to improve and move about the site or company as a whole to other departments/locations if they desire.
good,"Progreessive was a fun, fast paced place to work. The culture was terrific. Progressive is a diverse place and really invests in their employees. The amount of training I recieved was outstanding and the quality of the training is very high. I continued to get substantial raises and OT was always available but never required. I got to schedule my own time off, I never had to explain why I was taking a day off to anyone. They are incredibly flexible in regard to scheduling. It's a unique opportunity and a perfect blend of Auto Insurance and call center but not too much of either."
good,"If you get hired try keeping this employer. Many different career paths. They have a flexible schedule. Great benefits, especially vision coverage. Favorite perk was the private trainers at the gym."
good,It took me a few tries but once I got in I never wanted to leave. Don’t give up. It has a great culture with loving management and they believe in paying you for every single minute that you work
good,Progressive is excellence! The golden rule is used.  Objectives are implemented in everything. Integrity is expected and practiced. The company is Profit centered for employees and share holders.
good,Was a very good company to work for and had good work experience. I've been able to acknowledge my work skill to the challenges and to motivate me to perform my job duty even better.
good,"Worked here for several years and loved it! Great management, room for advancement, wonderful ethics and culture, gym, nap room, game room, license paid for."
good,This is my first insurance job and I plan to make it my career after being here for 3 months. You really feel valued at Progressive. For a company with almost 40k people they do a great job of making you feel like you matter. The work is interesting and the management is extremely helpful and encouraging. Very team focused with an emphasis on helping your peers succeed.
good,"Enjoyed the work, but very hectic.  Claim volume was heavy, and processes and procedures tended to be changed frequently without a lot of training on the new process.  Overall though, a great company!"
good,Progressive culture was focused on growing the company with talent from within. Management was understanding of life outside of work and promoted a healthy work life balance. Benefits were excellent with many on site privileges.
good,"Flexible, set schedule, good pay, many many opportunities to grow and move up. Don’t love the exact position I have because you are 100% glued to a computer nonstop but once you move up from that, the company is amazing"
good,"Progressive overall has been my best employer to date . I began as an entry level representative ; as a first notice of loss taking claims . I have since been promoted five times since . My annual salary has literally increased more than 3x than when I originally began . The have a bonus (gains share) that you get in December. How many employers even give bonuses anymore ?.. and this is a several thousand dollar bonus , variables is mainly your salary and position Health benefits , paid vacation/sick and holidays. My only complaint is I wished there were MORE opportunities to work from home. I’ve been part of the progressive family 5 years and have no intentions of finding another employee ."
good,"Progressive ensures a good worklife balance and plenty of career advancement, benefits seem to be above industry standards. Hands off management for the most part"
good,"Every once is welcoming"
good,I would say this is the best call center I have worked in.  Progressive has many ways to include their employees in events both in the office and virtually.  Management is always available.  If I was wanting to make my career in phone sales I would never leave.
good,"The best company I have worked for!"
good,I worked in the claims office in NE Texas and it was a great atmosphere and very interesting!  Everyday was something new and my coworkers made everyday so much fun!
good,"It's a great company with a good leadership model. They truly care about their employees and compensate us well."
good,Enjoyed working for Progressive.  Stable job.  Very good managers .  Open door policy was good.  Enjoyed having steady work.  Company was very flexible.
good,Progressive has a great culture and they are always willing to train. You do have to be comfortable with the cubicle type work. casual dress code. great place
good,"Greeted by several smiling representatives. Artwork throughout the building. Employee engagement in office and virtually. Support from team members, coaches, supervisors, and cross departments."
good,"good benefits good supervisors and co workers, nice money and bonuses, easy work with . room for growth. a lot of red tape to jump through if you have an illness. but otherwise a good employer"
good,"Would never leave"
good,"It's not for the faint-hearted. When it comes to coverage, coverage issues and liabilities, most customers are ignorant of what coverage's they actually have and what the policy actually covers. Not to mention, even fewer understand how insurance works as a whole. In turn, you have to give bad news a lot. A lot of customers get angry when you advise them on the policies and limits thereof. "
good,"Direct contact with clients, hospitals, 3rd party vendors, attorneys. Provided information regarding insurance benefits and amounts available for treatment coverage due to car accidents."
good,"They follow through on everything the say say will do. Great training. Good work/life balance. Good vibe. On site amenities, gym, lockers, etc). Effective and fair managers."
good,Progressive encourages advancement at the employees' pace. They provide learning opportunities and pen promotions for which you apply as opposed to waiting for someone to notice you.
good,"If you get hired with Progressive, you'll quickly realize how good the place is. Training is not only top-notch, they make it fun. You start blending with your teammates day one."
good,Cant say anything bad about Progressive I just didnt like working in claims.  Company is very fair in terms of compensation and work/life balance.  Good opportunities available at all levels.
good,"Nice place to work, I enjoyed my coworkers and job duties. The time off was nice and the bonuses were nice, I enjoyed the respect I got from management"
good,Great Company to Work for with Advancement Opportunity. If you work hard and have great attendance and good performance. Your bonuses and raise will be very rewarding.
good,Great position at a great company. Worth applying for. Great benefits. Well managed. Good work environment. Nice coworkers. Great 401k plan. Never boring. Apply today.
good,"This job can be rewarding since you get too assist so many people through a very difficult time in their lives. Most customers you deal with are going to be understanding and look for guidance while the other portion of your job is handling those people that are irrational, rude, and demanding. "
good,"I could not say enough about Progressive. They have wonderful supervisors and coaches who truly love giving you the tools to help you succeed. The only downfall were the hours! I worked 11am-10pm, while I was heavily pregnant and then again after I gave birth. Just need a regular 9-5 back!"
good,Progressive is a good company to work for. The benefits and compensation are solid.  There is good management locally. The job can be stressful because of the customer service requirements and the competing pressures of trying to satisfy your customer and the company while also negotiating with other interested parties (ie lawyers or body shops). The work is fast paced and you have a satisfied feeling when you help a customer.
good,"Progressive is not your typical call center job! Very relaxed, flexible hours and scheduling, they truly believe in a work-life balance. Everyone treats everyone like family here, I look forward to coming to work everyday. This is the only job I've been at consistently and I'm going on 3 years."
good,"Before Progressive, I would have never recommended any other company to work for. I was truly happy with my job from day one. Not only did the company make sure we had everything we needed to do our assignments. They really had so many accommodations to insure we were able to fully enjoy our leisure time."
good,"Excellent office with a very diverse workforce. Typical day is spent investigating upwards of 7 claims on a very busy day i.e. snow storms. One conducts interviews of insureds and claimants for liability, coverage and handling repairs. The job is stressful keeping on top of all of your tasks and holding the hand of customers that don't understand how insurance claims work, don't understand the coverage they have and will demand rentals etc when they never signed up for one. "
good,"Everyone was very considerate of anything going on in life, coaching was done regularly to help you in your position.  Overall a great place to work with great people."
good,"Excellent company to work for. Was treated very well. Was  wll educated about legal documents and Insurance claims. Management were experts in their fields. Leared,alot about how insurance claim are settled via attorney represented or direct settlement to a claimant."
good,"Excellent work/life balance. Great environment. Awesome people. Diverse and accepting of all. Would still be there if comp was a tad higher, or option to make commissions on sales. Highly recommend."
good,Working at Progressive has been a great experience. People are very helpful and collaborative. My contract completed and I had to move because of my personal requirements. Otherwise I would have loved to continue at this position. I have learnt a lot over the period that I worked at Progressive. Vijaya has been a great help for me.
good,Great place to work and always room for advancement.  If you enjoy working in a fast paced environment and learning new things Progressive is the company for you.
good,"I began a career with Progressive in their customer service division in 2008. I remember feeling overwhelmed because the campus is quite huge. However, the environment was very relaxed and welcoming. The training rooms are located to the back of the building and the main rooms, where training is held, are pretty huge! Once you are out of the floor, you have your tradition cubicles with mid walls to branch off you and your co-workers. A typical day at work would be arriving at your station (which your desk is pretty permanent and rarely move) you would be expected to login and jump into queue. Majority of the days the demand was high and often led to back to back phone calls. Most of the time you would get caller who were nice and sweet, however, you would have some that wasn't that happy to call. This is typical of a call center environment. One of the good things about Progressive's culture is that the break system was very unconventional to say the least. This is a good thing! If you wanted, you could combined your two 15 minute breaks in with your lunch hour. The only catch was that you couldn't do this within the first of last hour of your shift, which still isn't bad! Management is friendly and I had not ran across a rude individual yet at Progressive. The managers are were assigned were nice, laid back and very understanding. The best part of the job for me is being able to participate in customer service appreciation week. Everyday was different in terms of what the company would do. For example, they would provide breakfast one day and the next day there was a gaming"
good,"great place to work.flexable. great pay. management could use more training and learn what direct reports actually do, though. nice gainshare check at end of year"
good,Great company to work for but very difficult to expand my knowledge and obtain new career opportunities. I want to be able to use my masters degree to the best of my ability and move up in a company.
good,"Progressive knows how to take care of their employees. As my first real job outside of college, it is a great way to build experience and make a decent amount of money. I feel as though I am experienced enough to take on other roles however, most of the time you will start at their basic roles so that you understand how insurance works and the insurance process with regards to accidents. Most of the days during the week are pretty busy so you can take anywhere from 35 to 60 calls in a day (avg about 4-8 calls an hour). There days where the call load is much less and you may only take 25 calls in the day. In the central claims unit, you will more than likely deal with many rude customers but keep in mind their frustration and sensitivity of their situation. Management is awesome. They work on helping you become successful and they have that mindset of helping you move up within the company. Many people might feel micromanaged but supervisors are only doing their job and give you the necessary tools to go to that next level. The culture is very open and it's basically an open door policy when it comes to the managers. If you have a problem or some concern, you can talk to most supervisors and they will hep you. Hardest part of the job is just dealing with the rude customers however, understand you are there to help them at times in need so you basically know what you signed up for. Leave the job, at work. Do not bring it home with you. That's as simple as I can put it. I enjoy how quick time goes by, the work environment and how helpful the supervisors are."
good,Great place to work where they notice and reward you for your accomplishments. Not your typical call center environment.  Very relaxed and stress free.  Progressive does not have a high turn over rate...most employees are there for 5+ years.  Job consists of taking inbound calls from agents and customers inquiring about their auto insurance.  It can be anything from putting together a quote to taking a payment.  Great training so you feel well prepared to take calls.  Lots of support.
good,"I really loved Progressive, but I came into Progressive through a contact company and that is where the tough part come in. Progressive is great though, relaxed atmosphere, good people and you basically are able to do as you want as long as your job gets done."
good,I learned a lot in regards to what is expected to revive your lifestyle through self benefit. I believe the opportunity and knowledge I have learned has given me an overall leg up in all aspects of life.
good,"Progressive Insurance was a great company to work for, excellent benefits, managers were all very easy to work with, great work-life balance, and gain share at the end of the year was always nice."
good,"The management team  at Progressive is amazing. "
good,I wish they had better schedules.  It's a stressful job but when you feel that your company cares you push through.  I thought Progressive did a great job in showing it's employees that it cared.
good,Flexible work schedules with very fair pay and benefits. Management is supportive and company culture values integrity and fairness. Often very busy for jobs on the phones.
good,"Progressive has been one the best companies I have worked for by far. They definitely offer a diverse culture and appreciate their employees. Definitely not your average call center, they rock the industry!!"
good,"My schedule was 5:00 A.M. to 1:30 P.M. Monday - Friday."
good,Progressive as a company Was excellent!!!!! I would go back there in a heartbeat. I did not have a great Management Team. I wish i could have a do over.
good,Expectations are high and you are compensated to be a brand ambassador. Fast paced work in which you are rightfully expected to treat your internal and external customers as you expect to be treated. Unlimited advancement if you truly want to move up within the organization
good,"If you enjoy claims processing and handling a large volume of auto accidents, you would enjoy this position.  You wear many hats in this role and it is a burn out position after awhile.  However, you gain valuable insight into auto accidents and the investigation and interviewing of people is interesting and rewarding."
good,"Your typical day is centered around keeping up with all of the happenings in a large computing environment.  These happenings can include problems, changes, disaster recovery, and so forth.  "
good,"I truly enjoyed my time at Progressive and made several life-long friends there. We were always busy, but the people I worked with over the years made even the toughest days pleasant. Even though the job of adjuster was challenging, there were always new experiences to learn from and share with others in the office. My time at Progressive helped me develop my customer service skills and improve my communication skills, especially when dealing with difficult situations."
good,"the company believes in treating customer with utmost respect.  They start with their employees.  as far as being a liability adjuster, they make fair assessments."
good,"This company provided excellent training and staff support for its employees. The benefit package was good as well as the competitive pay scale. They offered opportunities for advancement and various relocation offices. The company was a new start back in 1992 and was growing quickly but still maintain a professional atmosphere. The training offered in depth and detailed understanding of the workman's compensation law as well as the old laws. Provided step by step instruction on opening new claims and analyzing legitimacy in the claim and how to manage the open file. It"
good,"i probablly learned the most for the 17 years i was employeed at progessive. namely customer service skills and professionalism. you had to adapt to change because progressive is constantly changing.i learned a lot about office procedures and computers. i worked with many different nationalties, races and ethnic backgrounds so diversity is very important to adapt to. the most enjoyable part of my job is the people who are always willing to step in and help with any issues that might arise."
good,A typical day at work is being on the phone selling insurance policies and data entry. I've learned a lot of patience with this position.
good,It was a call center job. They expect you to answer the phone and to be available. They give you tons of tool to use to balance the work load and allow you to browse the web as long as you are not on a call. They use NICE to they can see what you are doing when on a call. They were a fair company to work for. They harder you work and better you get from them. You also get gainsharing. The better the company does the more money you get based on your salary. They go out of their way to treat the employees nicely. Their call volume can be really high at times. Co-workers are great. Management is fair.
good,"*Processed new insurance policies, modifications to existing policies, & claims forms. "
good,"Work 1-10"
good,"I enjoyed my time with Progressive. well rounded Company. Good employees."
good,Great place for a young person to begin a career.  Compensation is great and the work environment is healthy.  Problems such as work place harrassment of any kind is not tolerated.  Many job opportunities with multiple levels of advancement available.
good,Great place to gain work experience and potentially start a career. Very stable job but can be time consuming and difficult for those who are not efficient.
good,Handled property damage claims and assisted with customer service.  Great company to work for.  In our current office there is not a whole lot of room for moving up.
good,"Productive and fun company... They do try to offer a balanced work and personal life, however they have a strict attendance policy that can be difficult to adhere to as a single parent.  Great pay and great atmosphere!"
good,Frank Booth associate are a great company to work for. You can learn a great deal and be trained as you would assume you would be trained.
good,"Progressive has a lot of things going for it, and really is one of the better places I have worked. They have a lot of flexibility with scheduling that will almost mystify you if you have worked at a very strict business in the past. The work itself can be quite repetitive and at times very stressful considering the content of the discussions you are having with people. Despite that, I felt like I had enough tools and training to keep people relatively happy with what I was doing for them."
good,Great place. diverse. great benefits. Excellent people to work for
good,Great Benefits and Incentive Programs. Progressive cares about their employees. The most enjoyable part of my job was exceeding expectations and being rewarded for my hard work and committment.
good,"A typical day at Progressive was fast paced and highly productive.  I learned the art of multitasking while working for Progressive, as many tasks needed to be completed all at once.  My co-workers were a diverse group of helpful, detail oriented people.  When dealing with insurance underwriting there are specific guidelines and laws that have to be followed therefore, finding ways to think outside of the box in order to assist a customer was the hardest part of the job.   The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of accomplishment that was earned at the end of each work day."
good,Amazing place to work.  Awesome employyees. My favorite part is asisting the customers.
good,Assisting staff in the day to day needs. The office is very personable. I enjoy everyday when I am at work. The management staff is excellent. They are just a joy.

good,"flexible work arrangements, good work environment, sufficient lateral and upper movement, high workload, competitive pay, good 401k program, decent benefits"
good,Terrible because I messed it up  it’s a true career spot  not your typical call center very adult n professional. Flexible can schedule ur own ot  beautiful career spot
good,without a doubt best company I have ever worked for. the culture of the company is all about Family and employee treatment diversity is a must within progreessive and pay is top notch for what we do.
good,"Progressive was by far my favorite place of employment. Flexible schedules, great pay, awesome benefits, gym on site and a culture that will make it easy to get up and go to work"
good,"The company was amazing overall. Great management, schedules and you can work from home. Everyone there is energetic and makes the day go by fast. Training was the best"
good,Progressive has a fun and fast-paced work environment that let's you shine in building relationships with customers. The training was thorough and enjoyable.
good,They are very laid back and care about their employees as much as their customers. They provide many different programs relating to work and life. Advancing was not a difficult task.
good,Great place to work they give you more than enough time for training. You are definitely ready before you start taking calls. They are very helpful to you.
good,"Progressive is a fun place to work. Very fast paced and challenging but doable. "
good,Enjoyed the company but was unable to accommodate my school schedule. The management is amazing and very helpful. The company pays their employees very very.
good,Progressive is an amazing place to work. They set the bar high for who they hire so you’re around really awesome people. Management is pretty down to earth. My only complaint with them is sometimes work place policies are sometimes not consistent with that’s happened before. Otherwise can amazing culture fun work celebrations and they have a bonus every year and their entry level people get get as high as 16% of their annual salary.
good,"Great place to work. High energy, very busy. Very detail and customer oriented. A lot of work, especially in the local claims branch. Would definitely recommend."
good,"Great Company to work for, a great place to start as a Medical Coder.  And Management always welling to help if you will like to advanced to another department"
good,"Begin organizing.   Making and returning phone calls.  mapping out a route.   Estimating,  Managing Auto repairs at Network shop.  Field estimates.    Customer conscientous and very professional job.   cares about the community it abides in.  and about its employees.  A very good place to work."
good,I handled quick claims usually by attending the scene of the accident in an Immediate Responsive Vehicle whereas I would usually settle the claim and draft a check and an estimate.  Then I would follow the repairs of the vehicles.
good,"Great place to work. There is advancement opportunities from within, soft and technical skill training, great benefits and job perks. The environment is friendly and advancing skills is encouraged."
good,"There are many opportunities to advance and they offer many options and training to assist in career advancement.  Great, family focused work environment."
good,Great place to work.  Positive culture and great management.  Management is always willing to help.  They show through different events how much they appreciate their employees. good work life balance.
good,Progressive is a great company to work for with a great CEO. People friendly and helpful for the most part. Great training program and great support. Great place to work for.
good,This particular position was through a temp agency. I worked until my contract was completed. I enjoyed the job and the people. I was not to happy about the distance from Dover to Newark Delaware.
good,"Progressive was a great company to work for. Management supported a great work environment. They followed ITIL and always strived to do the best that they could. "
good,"It was a very busy position, we answered anywhere from 80-100 calls per day. I learned the commercial auto policies and how to order mvr's, forward insurance policies and driving records to different states, take payment over the phone and send receipts of payment to different states.  Management was very supportive of their staff, we were not allowed to be talked to or disrespected in any type of way from agents, policy holders or the state. The hardest part of the position was helping a policy holder get their policy reinstated so their vehicle(s) or fleet of trucks would not be shut down by the state, it took time to get it done and sometimes the policy holder did not understand or agree with the process which we would have to explain and keep them posted on the progress. The enjoyable part were the lunches, gift cards and gain-sharing we would receive every year based on the company overall productivity."
good,I recommend progressive to anyone who is determined to work hard and move up. Start at the bottom and hard work will pay off! The work environment there is unlike any other place I have ever worked. People truly enjoy their job and it shows. It’s a very relaxed environment but busy. The perks the company offers is amazing and your spouse will also get to enjoy the perks as well. They have their own health center which have amazing doctors who take time to listen and help you unlike normal primary doctors. The vacation time is also amazing as you can build up as much as you want and use it. I would recommend getting your foot in Th door with a lower job and working your way up to gain experience and knowledge because there is so much to learn in the insurance world. If you don’t like your position there is sooo many other departments you can move to to help make a difference in the company without having to find a new job.
good,Progressive Claims is just like any other company which means a face pace work environment with a heavy workload depending on the day. Management is very helpful and training is very thorough. Things do change often in the work place and you are expected to meet certain goals and criteria.
good,"Great pay, awesome culture, collaborative environment, and room for advancement. Training programs are very comprehensive and prepare you very well your position."
good,Working at Progressive has been a great experience. The culture at Progressive is great and they are very keen on ensuring the employees feel a part of the process.
good,"I love progressive "
good,great co-workers.  great managers.  left due to career advancement.  being an mrr was the most stressful as they would set you up on a day that had more than 8 task.  but the team would come together and help one another and get the jobs done.
good,"I have interned at Progressive three times in the past few years, in multiple fields. Each experience was incredibly positive."
good,"a great place to work. feels stress-free, everyone is accepting and nice, very pleasant to work with, and there are great benefits and ways to advance through the company"

good,Working at Progressive was a wonderful experience. Each day was different and challanging. People who work there are friendly and extremely helpful. Management really want you to succeed and will assist you with any goals that you have
good,I really enjoy working for Progressive. The company offers a wonderful work-life balance that allows you to be flexible as long as you are contributing to the bottom line. I especially like the integrity that flows from upper management all the way done to individual contributors. By far one of the best companies I have worked for.
good,"I loved working at progressive, it has a wonderful culture. Also Progressive is big on hiring from within and there are tons of positions to choose from. I would recommend this job highly. I miss working there."
good,"follow the guidelines and be professional, they really take care of their workers. They do a lot for their workers and for the community. It's almost lke a family but you hae to be willing to work"
good,Work was fast paced but you were rewarded at end of year for all y our hard work with a profit sharing.  I liked the people I worked with and found the work rewarding.  Not too stressful although their were sales metrics to meet.
good,Managers and employees are easy to work with and reviews are fair. Compensation is within industry standards. Good benefits. Past paced but rewarding.
good,"Great place to work, excellent pay, easy going sales positions. The only problem is advancement through the ranks can be slow as the process takes quite some time in a lot of cases."
good,"Inspect vehicles for damage sustained in accidents whether at the owners work, home or at a body shop or wrecker yard.  Assist customers to get back to their pre-accident condition.  Maintain rental report while vehicles are under repair."
good,From what I can recall tons of information; they were not organized into pc's like today so it was a longer call. This was frustrating for both customer and agents. I was not there that long because I got engaged and my former husband had an executive level job so we moved to Florida where I reside today. It was extremely fast paced with calls back to back to back which made my head spin making it difficult to concentrate on new issue. Co-workers and boss were friendly and we did get free lunch in a nice cafeteria. I was not so sad to leave that job it was tough but formed great experience for customer service and management and related opportunities.
good,"Depending on the position, you are given all of the training, licenses, and equipment to get the job done.  Not every day can be wonderful, as we have deadlines and are in a customer service role, but Progressive makes sure we are healthy and happy with periodic outings."

I feel like pay is well above average, especially for the Virtual workforce, which is full-time work from home. Like most companies based on sales and customer service there are metrics to meet but you never feel pressured or as if your job is dependent on meeting goals.

good,"I laugh at the reviews above. First off, no breaks and no lunches? That is a direct lie. If a manager is not allowing you to take a lunch, then you need to take that to HR. Progressive's company policy is two 15 minutes breaks (one every four hours) and one hour lunch per 8 hour shift. So, if you're not getting lunch, that's an issue with HR. Management here, like with any company is great with a few bad apples. No matter what company you work for, it's always going to have negative reviews from employees who just didn't get something they want. If you worked there for a year and it is so bad, why are you staying? "

This is the first place I've worked where a company has showed just as much love to their employees as they do their customers. Progressive offered an hour and a half break time which was able to be split up through the day, flexible hours, plenty of time off and all supervisors were so helpful and wonderful.
