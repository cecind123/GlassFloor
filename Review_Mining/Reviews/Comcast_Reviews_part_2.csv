good,"I work mostly without direct supervision. I am given minimal requirements and goals and it is up to me to achieve them."
good,"My typical day consisted of answering incoming calls, assisting customers and technicians by scheduling appointments, time arrivals, go backs, correspondences via email and trouble shootings, while maintaining good customer service relations. Management was excellent/ quarterly reviews, co-workers were great team players. The hardest part is investigating fabricated stories from customer's to receive free services. And the most enjoyable is completing my task by providing excellent service, maintaining good customer service relations."
good,Good Culture and Fun place to work also company gives good training for current skills and productivity also for advancement and provides good benefits and retirement
good,"Goes to work 30 minutes early to prepare my tools (PC, software for troubleshooting equipment) and for pre-huddle sessions with our team supervisor. "
good,"Sales of cable service - internet, TV service and telephone service."
good,"A typical day at work was warm and cordial environment with team members and other colleagues. Day to day work was good with open door policy with Management. Great communication relationship with direct supervisor. The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines because had to rely on external business partners to provide paperwork, which are not always received on time but always worked out a cordial solution to that problem."
good,"Great place to work, lots of benefits and employee engagement opportunities. Employees work hard together and for each other."
good,"I work with a dynamic group of people that assist in the install of all Xfinity Home Security products.  We ""set the table"" for all the technicians and resolve any problems they have at the job site.  We are a trial team in Chicago to determine if our team has impact on the install rate.  So far, we have boosted connection rate almost 10 points in the City of Chicago"
good,"Working as Account Executive at Comcast Xfinity with always have new challenge and mostly goals which I exceeded all my targets and over the years I have implemented a great management, organizational ability, sales and excellent interpersonal skills with the facility to connect with clients and coworkers. "
good,Casual dress code and flexible schedule. Can make your family first and lots of fun. Weekly game compitions within company.
good,My team could take up to a 180 calls a day per person. Management was always there to help. Sometimes the calls would get escalated but given the correct training we all succeeded.
good,Show up on time. The only company I know of that let's you do shift slides and point buy backs for having perfect attendance for 45 days. The medical benefits are great and affordable although member services are a nuisance. They should be there when you want to use them but we should have the right to call the insurance company directly without interference.i
good,"no work life balance for this specific position. Lots of risk, Wear and Tear on body. AWESOME pay. great work support. The company takes care of their people its just that position is the best i believe as far as pay and certain benefits like company phone, ipad, freedom and company truck. but unless you go to upper level management, any other position (in my opinion) would be a downgrade."
good,"I recommend Comcast to anyone, job security is there. Training is slightly inadequate but proper contacts for questions are readily available. I did learn alot outside of the training room, nonetheless. Customer Service may be a big focus for corportate currently - though in my opinion, unity within the offices and departments, as far as knowledge and processes definitely needs to be addressed."
good,Loved working for the company. Very knowledgeable company.If the opportunity came i would quickly go back.Will reapply.
good,I've learned a lot great things in Comcast. One of the most important lessons I've learned is Quality. It's vital to make each customer feel like their V.I.P status because without the customer we will be without a job.
good,"Large call center environment with very supportive leaders. Mostly about the numbers and performance, but such is expected with such a large company. Very cool colleagues, felt a lot like a work family, which was the best part of the job for me. Had hoped to be working in a Virtual capacity, but that initiative is still in the works."
good,Work with different individuals Comcast accounts recommending them of better deals available in their area and different opportunities as far as packages are concerned.
good,"I had a big day doing service calls, troubleshooting different problems on residential and commercial applications."
good,"Great place to work, very stable environment. Fun and very rewarding. Co-workers are all very nice, credible and genuine people. My personal opinion is this job does not get very hard, but as any job you have some days you get customers with un-common issues and need more attention than most customer accounts. Overall I believe the best part of this job is knowing your customer is highly-satisfied with your customer service, as well as solving/helping with their reason for their call."
good,Professional environment and a great place to work in where you network with customers and Co-workers from all walks of life.
good,I have enjoyed working here.  The Management team is very supportive with clear directives.  The Company has great benefits and incentives.
good,"Greeted & helped customer with billing issues,cable services."
good,had this as a internship while going to university as a undergrad. taught me alot and gave me the experience at that moment which i was looking for
good,"I would schedule call backs  , I would sell ;products and try to solve issues . and I would file paper work ,be on the computers, talking to customers,"
good,"I would arrive thirty minutes before my shift, check my mail book and read any literature left on my desk. Fifteen minutes later, I signed into the network and read my emails. I was not allowed to sign into the main tools because of labor rules, during this period I would speak to my supervisor concerning customer issue that was unresolved. My break was fifteen minutes at a scheduled time which affect you performance if not taken on time, I always strived to keep my schedule. My team consisted of twelve representatives for which I was the point person. The communication was mainly instant messaging, the questions consisted mainly of the correct application of promotions; at least once a day I took an escaladed call from a member of my team. Lunch was thirty minutes and was used to relax and watch the news with my co-workers. "
good,"Comcast is a fun work environment and with all the incentives and team game it makes work fun"
good,assisting customers with inbound calls to help them with services issues. i have learned how to take a large number of calls and also be accurate in my customer service performance
good,"Inbound calls to right size customers with cable, phone and internet sales. Offer assistance to search availability of services in the Delmarva areas as well as contact various departments in collections departments and accounting department regarding payments. Ability to make hourly pay with commissions."
good,"Typical day, is one of learning an teaching."
good,"Very fast paced, result focused, customer oriented, competitive call center environment. My co-workers are team players. My supervisor is the best and very genuine with her team. The hardest part of the job is to endure 90% of unpleasantness from customers who call in with inquiries, concerns, feedback, or complaints. But the best part of the job is making a difference in someone's life day to day by simple putting myself in the customer's shoes. I've learned that sometimes when people have life issues, and sometimes need to vent, you're not just representative that answered the phone that but sometimes you hold the equivalence of a therapist or friend just because you took the time to listen."
good,"Solid leadership team; forward thinking in technology design and customer facing initiatives."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"While I worked in Chicago for 9 years it was from 7am to 4pm M-F. However, when I moved to Miramar FL I was told from 8am to 5pm but the other managers would make a fuzz when I left at my schedule time so I had to stay about an hour or two longer every day to keep them happy, I had a few hours off at night and the weekends off."
good,Working at Comcast Cable was fun and challenging but it was also rewarding
good,I enjoyed being a field technician at Comcast because it was a very challenging type work. All trouble calls or installations offered a distinct set of challenges. Interacting with customers was also something that I enjoyed doing. Being on the road assisting customers with minimum supervision was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Wonderful Benefits, Senior Leadership wonderful to work with."
good,All tech will work 40 hrs a week. So you will have job security. You will learn about the cable industry and new technology dealing with phone services as well as internet. Every job (house/apartment) is a puzzle with missing pieces that you have to fix. The best put of the job is when you install or fix a customers problem.
good,"Other than micro management this is a great place to work."
good,the customers were fun to work with. the hardest part of the job was trying to get a customer to switch over there current service that they have.
good,Good environment to develop technical investigation skills
good,"Install internet cable television and telecommunication services and products"
good,"Work environment at Comcast is very inspiring. Management always tries to encourage all the employees to move ahead and pursue Certifications. Equal opportunities are given to each culture. Facility includes the gym, canteen, ping pong table to provide fun environment to all the employees."
good,"Working for Comcast is truly an opportunity for me to learn how to successfully conduct sales, and manage contacts to ensure customers receive the highest quality customer service possible. I have learned to be consultative, and thorough within the fast paced environment of business sales. Everyday is an opportunity to practice new and proven techniques to maintain my position as a valuable representative."
good,"A typical day will consist of taking calls from customers, about 35 to 40 call, call ranging from internet problems, phone problems or simple cable problems, all calls rated on a first call resolution level."
good,Hardest part of this job was the stress. Not being able to turn calls over to management that needed to be turned over.  Co workers were good to work with. I enjoyed having the ability to grow within the company easily.
good,"A great place to start. Going scripted, so not sure what direction going in."
good,"I only worked four hours per day but those four hours were packed full of fun and phone coversations with people all over the world, it seemed. I learned how to have fun at work and still do my job well. Managment was friendly for the most part. They were willing to work with you, helping to guide you if they felt you were getting stuck in a rut on the phone with sales. I worked with people from other countries at Comcast, learning so many new things. Like with any job there were those who are friendly and those who want to come in, do their job and go home. The hardest part of the job was to keep up with the ever changing promotional codes. The most enjoyabel part of the job was getting to know people from other cultures."
good,"Good company with family values, but still a huge corporation."
good,I got to work for 4.5 hours a day. from 4 to 8:30. I call exsisting customers for new products and services.
good,Comcast was a great place to work.  The people I worked with were great as well as the supervisors.  We constantly received training and coaching's which helped me to produce better sales results. There were always contests going on and we were well taken care of by the company.
good,"I have no issues with management or co-workers. I Learned that the company is always changing and you have to keep up with new protocols, technology, policies which is annoying sometimes when the new policies change 3-4 times in the same month. Most stress is dealing with customers that have a sense of entitlement to have everything free ( Example: some people feel they don't have to pay the bill after 5 months and yell when we turn the service off and magically they've had issues with the services  they say they've had for those problems for months but was never reported for those months and want a credit the amount of the bill matches the months not paid) But a good amount customers are fine as long as you know your stuff and how to resolve an issue. Outsourcers within the company can either fix an issue or do a fix that does nothing or make a issue 10x worst. (not saying i haven't seen a in-house rep do the same but more prevalent with outsourcers) The issue with outsourcers ironically this helps keep my job secure"
good,"I typical day at work consisted of running leads in the morning and sales/sales manager at night.I have learned through these jobs that just being myself was the best way to approach sales/promoting,my outgoing and honest personality rubs off on people,because of this I have moved up in every company,Managing co-workers and showing them not to be stiff instead be confident in what you are selling or promoting and people will listen,they will also have confidence in you,therefore trust you,the key to promoting and sales.The hardest part of any job is to stay positive,everybody will have a bad day now and again,but keep a smile and laugh,people will follow,The enjoyment about these jobs was people trusted my word and in turn where always satisfied with dealing with me,putting smiles on there face and showing them there is alot of fun to be had,as long as they follow me and my word.My fun nature has always helped me.I'm a leader and know for sure I can put people in the clubs,when they see you having so much fun they want to follow.People walk up to me even now and ask me what the best clubs are in town,being new here,I can just share my experiences and they still ask me how to get a hold of me when they come back,so I think this is perfect for me between my fun personality and looks give me an advantage in this field.Just need that one chance to prove to my employer.Then they are also believers.People can read when it,s just a job,or if you really believe in what you are doing,that is huge.The key to having people follow you.They want to also have the fun you are having."
good,A solid company with a solid history.  This is a great company to work for if you want to grow in your career.

good,I started off as a product specialist and worked my way up too a customer service supervisor
good,"The CAE position was my first job with Comcast.  It was a great way to understand the cable industry and the passion that customers bring to the table.  The overall experience was good.  In every job, there are good and bad attributes.  I believe so far my experience has been a good one.  The CAE job is one of the easier ways to join the firm."
good,"Depended upon the day "
good,"Superviser also open and friendly, I really Liked that Comcast has an open door policy, that if you had any issues you could take it to any manager in the company to discuss it."

good,"Install cable jacks, and set up cable modems and boxes for Tv's"
good,It's been a while since I worked for Comcast but when I did it was a good company to work for.
good,"i learned that customers always come first , you put your customers needs first and sell for the customer not for your pocket, win win situation."

good,Just a day at work come in answer phone go home.Wake up go back and do it all over again
good,"Comcast was a good place to work. My co-workers were easy to get along with, as was management. Worst part about the job is getting into an unkempt crawl space or house. Best part was the 4, 10 hour day shifts."
good,"get people, safe environment, stable place to work. Coworkers and management get along well. great compensation."
good,The benefits at comcast almost can't be beat. On top of the health/dental/401k there's the discount on their services which makes working for them all the more sweeter. The peers I have here are some of the best ever. I like actually being able to help people but that can be difficult when you have a sales objective you need to hit every month.
good,"This company is great to work for, I learned a lot in the communications industry and with so many constant changes, technological advances and competition, I had to stay on top of it all before starting my day."
good,Comcast is a good company. They provide excellent benefits. Management and Supervisors are really nice and provide great coaching. Co-workers are wonderful people.
good,Nice environment;
good,"You choose what hours you want to work as long as you meet quota, management is great and eager to help you, co workers are a tightly knit team, hardest part is meeting quota some weeks and working in the rain and soon the snow, most enjoyable about this job is it offers a lot of freedom if you work hard and has lots of potential to achieve."
good,"Comcast provides me with job security, good benefits, and a schedule that worked well for me. The free cable was a bonus!"
good,"A work day here is routine. You drive to the office, you pick up your route, you grab your equipment and you leave."
good,"A typical day at work: arrive at 8am work till 5, 6 and sometime 7pm. I learned that you would always have work on your desk no matter how many hours you work in any given day. Over the years I've had wonderfull managers who belived and tusted in me to get my job done...my manager and co-workers all worked as a team, or I should say like a family. The hardest part of the job was...seeing co-workers come and go. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with...my managers and co-workers, which made all that hard work a little easier."
good,"Multitasking is a given, hard work is rewarded, and top notice training with promotion options are yours for the taking."
good,· Facilitates communications.
good,"I loved my job!! The people I worked with were wonderful. I met and married my husband at Comcast, as do many people. My supervisor was a minister and was the one who married us."
good,"First of Comcast has great benefits and they really do take care of their employees. Health, Dental, 401k, Free Cable, Free Internet, they even have pet insurance available. They are always having little contests to help people to try and collect more so it pays off when you do well. You make an hourly wage as well as commissions on any money you collect. They are pretty strict about being in and out of work on time, back from breaks, things like that. If you are good with customer service, I don't think you'll find anyone better than Comcast."
good,Comcast is managed well financially and strategically. Total compensation is competitive. Job security can be an issue depending on where you work in the organization.
good,One of the best companies I have ever worked for. I was very happy with my income and benefits.
good,"This will only tear you down if you let it just like any job can..it is what you wanna make of it.i chose to take advantage of the chances to make better commission through sales,working over time and receive decent bonuses.promotions only get dealt to those that choose to work for it.you only get fired if you choose to under perform or cant adhere to attendance"
good,"Fast pace job that will teach you by sending you to Comcast University. The education to control your work environment is helpful and they give you all the needed tools and more. Very supportive and great trainers. "
good,I love working for Comcast. I have been with the company since last year. The job can be stressful at times ( like any other job ) but I really enjoy my job and I feel like management wants me succeed. And our site director and HR are amazing!
good,"Taking back to back calls with disgruntled customer's is not for everyone, but it is challenging and never boring. Remember you also have to up sell even after resolving, or tying to resolve the customer's issue."
good,Comcast Spotlight is a great company to work for. I have learned a lot about advertising in the past 5 years. The company has great benefits and  allows you to balance your personal + work life.
good,"Great group of people to work with at the South Burlington, Vermont facility.  Management was truly dedicated to staff and success of the location.  Great company benefits..  Lots of employee support inside and outside the work environment."
good,"They are making a lot of effort to change things, but they are still just like any other large corporation. They're willing to spend billions to buy out other companies while limiting the pay of employees. The pay is average, but not great for the long term."
good,"Typical day at work, greeting customers, having open ended conversations to determine their needs, offering products and services accordingly. Lots of bill review and problem solving."
good,"Overall, great to work for. Great benefits like medical, dental and vision. Also has service discounts if you get them in home. Company matched 401k. Lots of PTO."

good,I enjoyed working here. base pay was not great but commission opportunity was great. The employee's were like family. promotion was always available and offered to inside  employment.
good,"In the inview just be yourself try not to be nervous.  For me it was a pleasant experience.  They do interview alot if people so be honest and friendly, you'll do good. They probably hire 40/100 ."
good,"This place was surprisingly satisfying to work at. They train you the right way, offer you plenty of opportunity to improve your skills and the benefits are pretty good. If you get an interview with them, I recommend taking it!"
good,"As long as you stay on their schedule and meet the metrics they are a joy to work for. (The training they provide is more than adequate to perform your job.) This company actually cares about their employees and likes to see everyone succeed. They do promote from within and encourage people who have been in their positions for a couple of years to try other departments so the work doesn't get stale. They try and do 2 to 3 major events during the year to celebrate and entertain the employees. That may not seem like much to some, but there are plenty of companies that don't do anything or bring bagels in once and that's it."
good,"Great place to work the people are great to work with along with a clear mission to meet the customer and employee's needs. There are opportunities for advancement if you are willing to move, However depending on your location there may be plenty of opportunity to grow in your current market. Demanding fast pace work change is always happening."

good,It was a pleasure for the short time I worked there. Everyone was nice and supportive on your team. Always encouraging to do your best in high pressure situations.
good,Comcast compensated very well. Their benefits package was also great and the environment was professional yet laid back. The managers had an open door policy. The competitiveness was very serious so if your looking for a low stress job maybe you're not a good fit for this sales environment.
good,"I learned with my 18 years with the company all the facets of customer service, Cable-related technologies(VoIP, DOCSIS, MoCA, RF issues), project teamwork, and other skills."
good,Call center work is for folks comfortable working alone. You will spend your entire shift alone at your desk. All your minutes are tracked. There is huge compensation for being good at your job and zero repercussions for being poor. Comcast tries really hard to make their benefits and pay compensate for how awful the general population is to call center employees.
good,Comcast was a good place to work at. I was at top pro former and trainer at comcast. I liked the environment and management I had to leave due to pay it was not enough.
good,My only legitimate complaint about my job here was some of the customer houses I had to go in. Some people have no regard for cleanliness and are not ashamed of the state of their home.
good,"Everyone around is very supportive, the work can be overwhelming but the support helps. There are opportunities to grow within the company but it does require min one year which is kind of a downer."
good,"benefits are good, Good starting pay and comcast services at an employee discount too. good stuff. The culture is very positive. doesnt really feel like a call center. very open with glass doors and lots of sun light. sit stand desks,"
good,Although the stress and anxiety i gained from working here. The benefits were amazing and i had such an awesome team i got to work side by side plus my supervisor was top notch!

good,people are great and fun to work with . supervisor are great as well. work environment is relaxed. sometimes the phones get very busy back to back but it makes the day go by quicker.
good,Comcast provided me with all of the tools necessary to advance my career in any direction I chose.  My management team was invested in my success and did everything they could to ensure I would succeed.
good,"Had i not been moving 2 hours away, I would have loved to stay and work for the company. Good pay, great benefits. Outside of the company, the people you work with will quickly become family."
good,"4-Day work weeks are nice.  The office I was working out of has a wonderful family atmosphere with very good management.  The pay isn't the best especially starting out, but you advance quickly. The benefits are amazing."
good,"In bound/ out bound call center, very high pace environment.  When assisting customers from all walks of life, its extremely important to maintain professionalism, patience and listening skills is a must.  Working in this very fast pace environment gave me the skill, perfection to become highly endeavored in my todays career choice."
good,"Comcast is an exceptional place to work.  They pay well and provide great benefits, the only downfall is the work itself.  You deal with callers who are generally upset about their bill.  You have to sell the value of their services which can be difficult at times with the numerous streaming options.  Comcast is a very inclusive company, they pride themself on being a premier employer for the LGBTQ community."
good,Great opportunity to build a business and generate new revenue opportunities through maximizing marketing and ad sales.  Supportive colleagues.  Ability to be creative and operational.
good,"I have been with the company over 9 years.  Lots of opportunity to learn and grow, especially if you are willing to move.  Benefits are amazing and the business truly care about their employees which is a rarity in large businesses."

good,"Great company with good pay, room for advancement, awesome benefits. I really met a lot of great people and had a lot of awesome perks and programs. Unfortunately most of the things that made comcast great very quickly dissolved when they merged with nbc/universal"
good,"You need to have great people skills, know some about technology already, and need to have a ""hungry"" attitude towards providing great customer service."
good,"This is a great company to work for. Some management are really great at developing their people, while others are looking for people to stay in their current role."
good,Working with Comcast has been a lot of fun and its a challenge as the cable business has grown with everything going wireless and fiber it its a change everyday.
good,was a great place to get my start in telecommunications.  Comcast is a good company sometimes though they worry more about the customer than they do their employees
good,"My background is in Business sales. Not consumer sales."
good,"Working for Comcast there are excellent benefits and opportunities for advancements, they only downside is they usually only exist in larger cities, so it can be limiting."
good,"Provide in-call billing assistance & technical support"
good,"my best days were at comcast, i loved selling the customers more channels and i loved interacting with them. it was a great job, i moved on to be a contractor and make more money but the grass isn't always greener on the other side. was a great company, gave me a van to take home, gas card, a nextel phone to phone in my jobs and a whole tool set and training on the job was awesome, they always trained you in the next big thing coming out. i loved my job at comcast but that was a long time ago"
good,loved the job and co-workers also the advancements within the company. The company as a whole works well with training and also bonuses to all employees.
good,While working here I have been able to grasp a better understanding of a cable plant. The environment allows for learning and growth without the pressure of production goals.
good,"I would normally go into the work office and prepare all of my administrative work. There will be Team huddles every week and gather different sale tactics to help reach the month quota. We will go into the field, different cities within the Oakland area and go from door to door for prospective customers. The cons were knocking until 8pm at night in the dark with no supervision."
good,Good place to work. Mainting metrics can be hard sometimes. Things change constantly at Comcast. Good pay and great benefits. They get all your tools and uniforms. You also get discount on service. You also get to take your vehicle home.
good,I have enjoyed my time at Comcast. The technology and media industry is growing which makes your job more challenging as you always learn new skills. The staff and management are very friendly. There is room for promotion for everyone. Comcast provides discount to employees which is very helpfull.
good,"It was a nice place where people gather to work, Team was very supportive and very friendly. I suggest everyone this company, I am leaving this organization because of y contract got over."
good,"Everything is great until you deal with the customers. The managers are amazing, they care about your success. Training is great and always available. Opportunities for advancement. Only thing that wasnt for me were the customers."

good,"Day to day requirements are consistent, over all call flow is well managed and expectations are clearly established. To succeed at Comcast you must have strong customer service skills as well as clear communication with both clients and coworkers. I would recommend this employer to people looking to start a job in IT or anyone who wants to gain more on the job training as there are multiple avenues for advancement."
good,"Great place to work employees are cared , for, great benefits. There's always something awesome going on that makes you feel appreciated. Great atmosphere."

good,"As an outside Account Executive, my days started in the office confirming appointment, calling on clients, making presentations, signing new business and cold calling."
good,Comcast was a fun place to work with much support from team members and management.  You have the ability to work independently while maintaining close contact with each of your customers.
good,A typical day working as a technician for Comcast/Xfinity is overall good. I get to meet many different people and you never know what the day will bring.
good,"I loved working for Comcast, there was a lot of room for growth and development. They treated the employees amazing with opportunities for different things. I left when they were making a huge change because they didn't have any information"
good,"The work scheduling is a little inflexible, if for unavoidable reasoning you have to leave work early it becomes a problem. The department worked is the hardest cause you are outside working while under harsh weather conditions."
good,over all the company is fantastic and feel very lucky to have worked for them. top notch benefit that as in line with military benefits. only downside is that it was extremely stressful and I feel as if you couldn't get support on how to manage that stress
good,Great environment.  Employee friendly.  Very helpful management.   Complete and excellent training. Great work/life balance.
good,Comcast has the best benefits of any company I've ever worked for. The hours are long and sometimes customers can be rude but overall a great place to work.
good,Excellent culture and promote from within. Excellent benefits. Great schedules available and many incentive programs.
good,Solid company.  Management is good and respects not only the employee as an employee but also as a person.  Good work culture.  Plenty of opportunities for advancement.
good,Comcast is a great place to work and learn the fundamentals of new applications and procedures as they apply in today's world. The management is above exceptional.  Given the  opportunity to serve customers on a wider scale the company has decreased it's number of Customer Service  employee's in the Memphis TN. The environment was a great and friendly atmosphere. Great co-workers. I really miss working at Comcast.
good,It was a fast pace environment that you have to stay alert.  I met a lot of great people who they are very encouraging and push you to your fullest potential
good,"this is a great job to work at, energetic people in a team setting. hardest part is just dealing with angry customers that dont have services"
good,I love my job! Management and my co-workers are very friendly and makes you want to come to work for many more days. There's always room for growth and improvement.
good,"I enjoyed everyday in my job."
good,"Fast paced environment, great leadership team, great coworkers. Hardest part of job is angry customers and their verbal abuse."
good,"Comcast offers great competitive pay. Job advancement. Amazing benefits, and a great culture to foster its employees. The only con I can think of is that Corporate needs to focus on the needs of the consumer, if we are THE CABLE giant we have to keep it that way and innovate services that appeal to our customers."
good,"Everyone in the call center are excellent people.  Typical day at work depends on call flow but can be very fun and talking to customers can be rewarding. I learned patience and strengthened my communication skills, the hardest part of the job can be the job itself. And the hours I work. But the job is fun as well and co-workers also make it enjoyable."
good,Completed installs and trouble calls for new and existing customers.  Great job new challenges and experiences and modifying work orders to accommodate  the customer.
good,great place to work if you can handle customers over the phone. it was like working with one big family everyone is very friendly and the benefits provided are wonderful.
good,Co-workers are very nice and friendly as well as the managers and supervisors. The hardest part of the job is to convince the customers that what your selling to them is very beneficial to them and that they need it. The most enjoyable part of the job is that when you make the sales
good,I would have to say that overall Comcast is a pretty great company to work for/ They have great employee benefits and the environment is pretty awesome and family like as well. Pay is pretty good for the company and the ability to move further up in the company is very flexible
good,Great job with nice benefits. Very stressful though. You're on the phone in the same spot every day and it can get very repetitive.
good,"A typical day at work is walking into the office and feeling welcome with everyone saying good morning and bringing up moral together. "
good,"Good environment, just very stressful job. Most calls are you just getting yelled and screamed at by irate customers for things that aren't your fault. Somewhat unrealistic grading on your job functions. Pretty laid back supervisors though, and tons of free food and contests to make things fun."
good,"Working at Comcast has been  a great experience because it has taught me, how to be professional in a business, how to stay professional when it get rough, and how to speak professional. The job experience was new to me, because I'm use to working with patients, but I have adapted to the environment. The co- workers are good team members and the management team do there best to keep us on task. The job can get complicated at times when it comes to dealing with customers or sometime managment. I don't like the fact that we are on a point system because it almost makes you feel like your job in jeopardy if you don't come to work, even when you're sick or have something important to take care of they still expect you to be at work. I love the fact that we get paid hourly and also get commission pay, because that big check comes in handy every month."
good,Comcast Keeps you very busy and on your toes. If you prefer to be busy on your job then Comcast if the right place for you. You have your own work space and great support team and management staff. There is more than enough room for advancement and growth; however it will take at least 2 years with the company in order to be promoted.
good,This company truly cares for their employees and every now and then bring new things to the work environment to remember us .I would refer every one I know to this company ; you just have to understand your are with customer service so you need patience and understanding.
good,"I love the work i do on a day to day basis, but I feel like the compensation could be a little bit better. I have learned a lot about wiring and networking. The company is so large that is difficult to tell you about the higher up management but the management at the local Oak Ridge office is fantastic. They are fair and understanding of most any circumstance. The most difficult part of my job is going in crawlspaces and attics. I really enjoy all of my co-workers. They make the job so much better. We all work together to get the day finished."
good,"Works with outbound calling. SAP operations. Everyday I learn something new pertaining the job. Really easy to move up, after a year of working with the company. A very diverse environment. The hardest part of this job is selling to a customer over the phone, but some how I prosper. I enjoy the fact that they honor a lot of holidays most companies don't and provide employees with holiday pay no matter how long you have been with the company."
good,Learned a lot.You never get to old to learn.No matter where you go you learn new things.I have enjoyed working with people
good,"Working for Comcast is a great experience. The supervisors, the environment, everything is really great. There is only one problem and that is the customers. Generally the customers are really nice but just remember this is collections and you a generally not speaking to very friendly people (ones that don't like to pay their bills) Even though i have exceptional patience skills they somehow knew how to break me down and get very belligerent, tell me they would come explicitly assault me and blow up the building I was in or even come stab me. so please consider all of this. But if you don't mind that and want to work in a place with great incentives, benefits and commission this is a great place to work."
good,"Comcast is a great company to work for. The pay at the entry level is a little low, but the commission makes up for it. They give their employees free cable"
good,"Great place to work, team atmosphere and culture."
good,"overall a good place with good benefits and a fun atmosphere, loved working here when it was TCI, and ATT but Comcast made a lot changes. So the atmosphere became stressful"
good,"There was no typical day, everyday was different and educational. It was a pleasure to go work and learn something new everyday."
good,"overall positive and uplifting atmosphere"
good,"I would come in sign on to the phone and wait for a call to come in. I would help the customer as best as I could, otherwise transfer to another dept. The supervisors are really nice and understanding, the higher ups, not so much. On occasion you would get a screaming customer. Coworkers are extremely nice. Hardest part, dealing with a difficult customer."
good,"A typical work day would be logging into phone to take calls for the customers. These costumers would be calling in pertaining their bill as well as their services. You learn how to work with a billing system, You also learn how to handle irate customers. Learn the difference between the different packages that you can offer. The management team will assist you to the best of their ability. The co-workers are like your siblings. You work together as one."
good,Attracts potential customers by answering product and service questions; suggesting information about other products and services. Handling high volume of inbound calls & Preparing products or service reports by collecting and analyzing customer information.
good,"A typical day at Comcast would consist of taking anywhere from 30-40 calls per day to help new customers sign up for service fro TV, internet, phone, or home security. We would also handle upgrade services and sorting out issues with accounts that needed to be corrected."
good,The Benefits are great and the training is awesome. It's A great company to work for.

good,"Great pay, great benefits and people who actually care about their employees and peers."
good,"If there is a company that does more for the community than Comcast, then I have yet to meet that company. They are the epitome of a diverse work environment and provide excellent benefits, despite what the public thinks about them."
good,"Perform residential video installations complete from tap to customer equipment in single and multiple family dwellings including pre-wired units; perform additional outlets, reconnects, and change of service; perform all installations adhering to Comcast procedures and safe work practices, NEC and NESC requirements, and local ordinances in order to provide services to the customer."
good,part time job not so good. great for saving for Christmas money or just to have extra cash
good,"I would answer about 75 calls per day, when on the phones and help those customers with whatever they needed.  As a lead, I would help the reps on the phones with what they needed or take over the calls if escalating.  I would work closely with other departments on the escalated calls to provide a solution for the customer's problem.  I also worked closely with my immediate supervisor on special projects and to help make our team function the best for the customers and the company."
good,"Good company to work for. I had no issues, If I had then management was willing to work with their employees and compromise for the best outcome."
good,Come in and answer all inbound calls for customers with video or billing issues. As well as do some filing paper work and assisting with call backs for the sup. I learned how to take a proper call and how do most of my receptionist experience is from everything that I learned at Comcast. My manger was the best and was able to know that when I came to work and if I was having a work related issue he would be there to resolve it. Had very many co-workers they were all great to work with. The hardest part of my job nothing the most enjoyable part was knowing that I helped the customer resolve there issue.
good,"A typical day during my employment at Comcast would compose of providing product support, coinciding with providing an excellent customer experience.  We were responsible for managing our own time and resources from preparation to end of shift.  Utilizing my peers and management to help perform my duties was always encouraged, which taught me a good sense of both self and team efficiency.  The management open door policy customarily felt easy and comfortable.  We would change teams every six months which gave co-workers an opportunity to meet one another and really made the call center feel as a whole.  The hardest part of the job was getting difficult and complex customer issues, while at the same time, the most enjoyable part was resolving them."
good,"Great company overall, great benefits package and culture."
good,"Comcast Cable is an excellent company to work for...the fringe benefits were great (free cable-all channels including HBO, etc.)...the time demands for calls is what I really didn't care for. Some customers are tech savvy and can easily be walked through a problem while others are not and have trouble with just the basic instructions and it lent to undue and unneccesary stress because you knew that it would count as a ""strike"" against you if you exceeded the allotted time for a call....I give Comcasst 4 out 5 stars"
good,"A work day consists of a regularly schedule morning stand-up to engage tour team in a review/update of your activities for the past 24 hours. Each of us share our accomplishments, discuss issues and/or share expertise to help resolve issues; we also share our planned activities for the next day."
good,"A very calm work place where the customer is not the only thing that is important. A workplace that shows the employees, that they are greatly appreciated. The management is very hand on and its the perfect place learn and grow."
good,Great working with so many people. I had a hard time when customers did not let me help them. It was a great place to learn problem solving.
good,It is  easy to progress to next step in career. Very good job to network with people and very easy to understand and perfect the job.
good,"Love the people and the work. Learned a lot about equipment and what goes into the order. The people and managers, trainers are excellent. Had a lot of fun here. Good work environment. The company cares about their employees and believe it or not their customers too. "
good,Comcast was an enjoyable experience. The only con was how my supervisor spoke to us. He took pleasure is cursing us out daily in front of the crew and privately. However had a balanced work week working four days on and three days off. They also supplied the tools and vehicle for transportation with self-garaging. I wish things would have worked out.
good,"A typical day at work required me to clock in at my desk within 10 minutes of prep time we were required to begin taking calls. Our supervisors had their own desk and if we had a question we could instant message them or send them a quick email. I enjoyed working there very much, including the people i had the pleasure of spending my day with. The hardest part of the job i would say would be dealing with irrate customers. However, on a good note, this was a rare thing. The best part about this job would have to be talking to people all day. It makes the day go by faster and i enjoy speaking with people from all over."
good,The job was really fun. Making sales were competitive but it added to the overall great nature of the company. Enjoyed working with all the co-workers.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is maintain good customer realtion and treat each customer and have fun with co-worker. I learned that management took good care of emaploy by give award for employee who meet performance numbers and make employee to work hard to get the rewards. The hardest part of the job to make every customer happy but with education,experience and sikills I manage to make each customer happy."
good,I like this job. A good opportunity to make money but sales is not for me. Had awesome benefits but wish hourly wage was at least 10 and hour. Only 8.00 and hour...
good,"A typical day Comcast started for me at 3:30am where I ran all daily billing system for Heartland Region which inclued (5 states). I prepared the daily dialer files for the inbound collection ground of 23 agents to contact appx 23,000 customers per day. I maintain daily,weekly & quartly reports for upper management."
good,"This is a great place to work, everyone here is helpful and friendly. It is a very fast paced job, taking calls back to back with no breaks in between calls. Everything is measured on how well you do. Everything you do is in stat form and how you advance is all based on the stats you prduce."
good,"Comcast is and was a great company, they really cared about there customers and employees. Comcast provided me with the necessary tools to succeed in my job position, as well as other jobs."
good,"Call Center Environment, Daily Motivational Meetings, Back to Back calls, Opportunities to trouble shoot, problem solve. Learned a lot of technical innovations, Computer Coding, Sales, Customer Relations.  Management is wonderful.  Workplace Culture is very pleasant.  The hardest part of the job is de-escalating calls and satisfying customer needs.  The people I work with are the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,It's pretty much your basic call center work. People here are very nice and helpful. But training kinda throws you out in the real environment faster than what you are actually learning. I came in when there was a lot of changes going on so things I was told would end up not bring how things worked.
good,I think it was valuable and interesting to be part of the culture and guiding force that makes the Comcast organization a beneficial interest of many professionals.

good,"Comcast has great benefits, but meeting your sales goal can be hard sometimes when they are pushing online ordering, that takes away from in office sales."
good,Great job. I enjoyed working for Comcast within the short period of time I've been with the company. The sups were all great to me and also my peers. I would've  never left if i didn't have an family emergency.
good,"I was fortunate enough to work there for quite some time, the call center there was specifically tailored to multiple dwelling units (i.e. Apartments, College Dorms, Retirement Communities) and the atmosphere is quite great and encourages others to grow. Sure some of the customers can be a bit of a handful but the management and other employees are second to none."
good,"Friendly and fun place to work.The employees, supervisors, and management are easy to work with. I am just looking for something more in line with my degree and that would alllow me to travel at times."
good,The experience I received while working with Comcast for over a decade has provided a lot of great benefits and an excellent skill set in the customer service field. The benefits are tough to beat with any other company.
good,This was a god job but they needed to give more training on how install the cable selling the cable was fun. But it was hard to install with lack of training
good,"Comcast was the best place to have worked. Without the atmosphere they provide at the FoCo office, it would be almost impossible to take so many calls per day. We all know working in a call center, especially for a huge corporation like Comcast can be draining; because people are not calling because they're happy. The people at that center really made me excited to go to work. And when my family was hit with bad news after bad news, they worked with me. I will absolutely re-apply to Comcast and suggest working there."
good,"If you’re good with your hands, personable and have a thirst for knowledge I’d recommend this job. Pay is well, for the most part the other technicians I worked with were helpful or at the very least did their best to be helpful."

good,"Worked in the company’s call center assisting customers with billing concerns; including explanations of  proration and issuing necessary credits due to customer for overage paid for services."
good,"top down salesmanship"
good,Customer service is awful all they care about is sell sell sell when you sell a service they always find a way to mess up and make you look bad then you have to be a customer for the customer.
good,"I worked from customer service to high level positions in the company.  Anything deserved or told would get from the company had to ask for.  Policies not followed from manager to manager.  When my daughter died the $10,000.00 I paid years for was refused based on new company insurance policies on beneficiary age and never reminded about beneficiary changes and durations.  Who thinks about life insurance duration and benefits paid the same amount for each benefit not child.  Who thinks they are going to have to bury a child.  After complaint filed next year they started sending out reminders on beneficiary changes that may be changing after 18. Then just a little after 2 months of my mother's passing, I was at my desk was told to get my purse and taken into a  room with my Supervisor and HR and told I was being let go (I had seen it coming with new manager) for taking a vacation day instead of sick day of which I did not have sick time.  I was not allowed back to my desk, they packed up some things but I lost personal items. I was told by HR that I would get 2 week severance but never did.  I filed a complaint and the HR person said it was not the case and the supervisor agreed.  So after over 29 years of har work, on call for 10 years 365 days, working events and overtime when salary.  Each sale of company required support to include days, nights and weekends of work along with helping during community events attending sponsor booths holidays with my children being alone many days and nights.  Sleepless nights bad management depending on which company it was and no recognition"
good,I love what I do but I know I don't make as much as I should. That's why I came to indeed to see if I could find a career I can be proud of and take care of my family. I'm a very hard worker always on time and I get work done in a timely fashion.
good,Didn’t work for hourly it was all commission based and it was not a stable income and even if you had a off day not selling anything you would not get paid. And it wasn’t enough for a family.
good,The company is great but the call center environment can be very stressful. If it's not one thing its another when working on the call center. But I truly enjoyed my job and the opportunities that they offer
good,"Fast paced, commission based, stressful job, log on, assist customers with billing and sell xfinity products. The work environment  is not at all what they made it appear."
good,"This is a great company to work for. Excellent pay with great benefits. Unfortunately, they are going through restructuring which is affecting a lot of people's jobs."

good,Started off fun fast paced enviroment. Plenty of opportunities to grow within the company if you were able to promote from entry level to a different location the job was great.
good,"Comcast is a great company to work for but not every department is a great place to be in.  I would not recommend the customer service department in the Woodridge Customer service location, or the GCR but the company is great.  It really does want to bring a better product to the customer to enhance their entainment experience."
good,"Fast-Pace, Fun, Awesome Products, The hardest part of the job was getting the departments to work together.  I really love this company!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,There were a lot of great people there to work with but management was challenging due to people being in place that did not come from the same industry
good,I left the company after 1 year of service because the companies focus was on numbers instead of the staff.
good,"i feel like they should have better pay for us tech out in the field."
good,"no complaints. good work life balance pay is ok. moving up is always a possibility and overall I am happy. co workers are responsible."
good,i loved working for the company but the management was not about their employees more so about themselves
good,"I really enjoyed working there, just the working hours after the training, were very inconvenient for a working single parent, without paying lots of $ for childcare for the 3pm to midnight shift."
good,Nice company to work for! Pretty much I work from 8AM until 5/6 PM. Management not bad at all. There’s really no hard part to working there besides irrate customers. The best part is that I can mainly set my own hours. Overall it’s a pretty decent company to work for.
good,"The telesales department I worked in was very opportunistic. The money is there to be made, however they protect their bottom line employees more then the leaders. Agents their make false claims about leaders they don't like and the leaders are treated guilty instead of innocent."
good,"Comcast is a great Company.Unfortunately is the people they choose to manage  are not capable to make the right decision.In many occasions is ""who likes you"" and not by the quality of work you do that you get a better opportunity to advance or being recognize."
good,Good place to work and good benefits managers does not have your back and they will fire you for literally anything but as long as you stay on pins and needles nice place to be
good,I worked in customer service definitely the worst department in the company. If you can make it out of there you will enjoy the bennefits of working for this great Company
good,"It all depends on what you do at comcast to be honest, if you are national tier 3 support. Well number one I am being laid off in about 30 days from now, number 2 - you are paid not enough for what you do. Management says that they are working on improving the work center but will not show you or prove anything. "
good,I love working at customer service job I was working from home with Comcast though a contractor but they didn’t want to pay me my money so I quit and I feel like they no longer needed my Services
good,"Only con was the personal issue of travel without a car or license. Traveling with equipment could be an issue if using public transportation. Otherwise the environment, management and co-workers were amazing."
good,Good environment. Learned differences to communicate between chat and voice. Hardest part is on you can make explanation or give information that was not discussed during the training.
good,"Although Comcast itself is an amazing Company to work for, the truth is a lot of the leaders within the company don't support advancement.  The benefits of working for a company like Comcast are limitless, but growth is hard."
good,"coming in to work everyday and interacting with your peers, and helping the customer solve their problem and knowing that we helped them and they are very satisfy with the products and the customer experience"
good,Provide daily key technical and procedural support to customer-facing field personnel by resolving issues regarding numerous facets of work order modifications.
good,I put forth maximum effort each and everyday. It's a great environment however being in outbound telesales doesn't pay no where as much as other departments. Plus their commission is bigger and better plus they get quarterly bonuses.
good,"Ok to work here, its been 7 years ago, I really don't remember too much"
good,I love working here just need more money the employee are very very nice they speak to you all the time
good,"I learned a lot at Comcast, Comcast is a great company, really fast paced, you always have to be ready for a change."
good,Loging in to the phones and computer systems are fairly easy. I learned that not any two customers are alike. Manegment usually sticks with managment. Your co-workers are the best though the\y really help make the job more barable
good,There was an honest effort from Comcast when they first took ATT Broadband over to establish a culture of transparency and outstanding customer service. I enjoyed working for the company. They seemed to value hard work and made many opportunities available for employees who were interested in advancing their careers.
good,"It was a ok experience. The benefits was better than the hourly pay. The sales required are sometimes, more than often unrealistic. We did get a bonus at the end of the year."
good,"I get a check every 2 weeks with good benefits..we get an annual raise, which is just about 4 % of your salary, noone really gets the max, 3xcept a few people"
good,"●	Built Web pages that are more user-interactive using AJAX, JavaScript, Dojo, React, Redux, and React Native."
good,"I currently work with Comcast and they make working here so beneficial. They have a great platform for your voice to be heard, although sometime ineffective."
good,"I started on the cable side of Comcast. Restructuring removed my position, but I was given another position in Business Services. Later I transferred to the Spotlight division.  I have met many lifelong friends through this company."
good,i enjoyed working for Comcast doing door to door sales. the pay was great all sales were commission based so no sales no money. the management were great so to speak.
good,In the beginning it was great but as time went by i realize i need something different. no the commission and benefits are great but there should be a balance between work life and my personal. it was a great experience i will say and a wonderful Company but certain things have got to improve.
good,"While the company in general is clear on it's goals and what is expected of people; the overall execution is flawed in the Business Services arena."
good,"Entrenamiento profesional de un clásico vendedor de Texas, un ambiente con mucha motivación para aprender a vender con el mejor estilo."
good,Comcast is a fun place to work and they are trying hard to improve employee moral.  They want to become the company that people turn to when looking for employment.  with the right attitude there is definitely money to be made in the sales department.
good,"Comcast was a great place to grow and learn, It does not give much way with illness or disability until you have worked there for longer than a year. Over all great place."
good,"Very high stress job! Focus wasn't on billing but rather sales. It was an excellent company to work for, for five years. They made a business decision to divide the country into two zones. We had a call system that hung up on every other customer. Then they outsourced to Manila and Mexico, where they couldn't document the records."
good,"Inbound call center, new customer sales, top down selling techniques maximizing each call to gain maximum revenue. I enjoyed working with great team members, The hardest part of the job was decreasing in commission payouts from year to year."
good,Super organization.  The NBCU organization values entertainment more than expertise which can limit many.   Crazy environment with many business units working independently.
good,It started off with great pay but had to go through a lot to make a good check.  I did like the employees and I hope everyone there enjoy their job.
good,It was never a dull moment here!!! When you arrived you will clock in and find somewhere to sit with a computer. We did not have assigned seats so it will be in your best interest to arrive a little earlier then your schedule. I loved the call volume and dealing with the customers. Our main goal was to sign someone up for Comcast or upgrade there package every time you received a call.
good,Management is getting better since i first started but its a good place to work. its good because some days are all busy and some days are so slow so you can get a break. other wise dealing with peoples problems will drive you crazy.

good,Founder of GenXFinity. We worked as a team to build tablet accessories for touchscreen devices. I bootstrapped for a year and a half and learned how to run a business through starting my own and bringing on 5 employees.
good,typical day of work training new team players on sales productivity and new systems
good,"My job description is inbound sales but, due to call routing I find myself dealing with a lot of customer service issues or calls outside of my ability to service. I learned to be extremely self sufficient when solving issues since there is no immediate management or supervisory assistance for customers. My colleagues are like family so it does help when I may need a quick response to solve a customers issue. I'd say the hardest part of the job is not having all the tools necessary when dealing with escalated customer concerns. The most enjoyable part I'd say is when call routing it what it should be and you can actually do the job that you hired in for and love so dearly."
good,Long hours
good,A typical day involves over 100 mile driving. Is very enjoyable having personal contact with customers. Management is currently regrouping. I work alone. Hardest portion is I pay my own expenses and drive my own vehicle. Most enjoyable is inter-action with a diverse quality of clients.

good,"Being apart of a company thats beyond its years, i was treated with the utmost respect and because had such a great time in my work station creating and making quota easily"
good,Depending on your department it can be very laid back and easy or extremely stressful and competitive.  Leadership - also depending on the department - can be very well connected or out for themselves.  Navigating the HR/politically correct atmosphere can be tricky.  Sales are very competitive but they set up for success. Operations can be competitive and move targets regularly.  Good overall company for driven people
good,".great company to work for , people are lovely great benefits and a healthy happy environment. Would highly recommend to work here. Lots of activists and office group work. Everyone is ember supportive. Great employee benifits on top of the common ones most companies have."
good,I worked at Xfinity from Comast as a Sales Consultant for about 3 years at one of my local stores. The pay it's fair and if you hit your goals you make decent money. If you exceed them even more. Benefits are great too! So I totally recommend working there. Customers can be rude but if you work in customer service you get that everywhere. This place actually pays you for the trouble.

My co-workers were great a great team of people to work with. The hardest part of the job was not being able to spend as much time as I would have like to with the customer at times.

The manager was not your normal manager he was a manger that cared about his employees because this job was more focusing on mental stability than physical. The co-workers are thoughtful and helpful if you don't know certain ways of approaching or how to talk to a person the would work out scenarios to help you get on the same page. The hardest part of the job I would say would be the filing and documenting customer service keeping up with the customer to make sure they would be home to get the cable purchased or ordered installed.

good,Well we started at about 7 o'clock in the morning. We recieved our route for the day and mapped our day out. Then we would pick up the needed equipment for the day and then we would normally hit our first stop at about 8 o'clock.  What i learned from working for comcast is that it takes a lot of team work and customer service to make a company of that size run smooth.  My co workers were some of the nicest people ive ever met. The hardest part of the job would have to be long durations of work in the freezing cold in the dark up on poles.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me would have to be the friendships i made with my co-workers.
good,"Working at Comcast is a fast pace environment, which I enjoy.. Organization is a must. Team atmosphere, but your responsible for your self and work. The hardest part of my role is knowing that I and my team has done all we can do , but a truckroll is still needed. The disappointment in the customer voice when we know just how important their services are too them.. The most enjoyable part will be laughter.."

good,I really enjoyed working as a contractor for Comcast. The Comcast employees were very accepting of the contractors and we worked very well as a team. Everyone was very willing to help someone out if needed. Management was very approachable and pleasant as well. If a particular order needed to be accelerated I would be approached by the manager personally. The hardest part of the job was trying to get an order completed and the necessary parts for the configurations were not available and I felt as if I was letting down the client. I learned a few different ways to approach the configurations and a few different systems to work on. I really enjoyed the work environment and the challenges of designing the circuits for the various types of environments that the circuits were needed in.

good,Excellent company to be a part of. Great work/life balance.
good,"In this feild of work you have to be alert at all times since it is a graveyard shift. And you are dealing with all kinds of customers offshore since they are based from the western countries. You should know how to deal with irate customers and know how to handle a great conversation with them. You have to be enthusiastic since you are only taIking to them through phone. You have to make a good impression to the customers so that they would be able to feel relieved knowing you could assist them with their concerns. We take inbound calls from customers assisting them with there issues such as billing explanations, collecting of payments, and downgrading and upgrading their services with our company. The hardest part is that we recieve aggravated customers and hearing profanity words from the start of the conversation but we should always let the customers calm down and and assist them with their concerns to the best of our ability. Our company never had issues when it comes to our salaries and also we have also have incentives for a job well done. We also have health insurance which we really find it useful since its a nocturnal job. I also never had issues with my co-workers because we easily get along with it each other and we always have teamwork."

good,"Optional shifts, great work environment. Solving customer issues are always a plus"
good,I enjoy working for Comcast. It is a well organized company that cares for its employees and the community.
good,There are few businesses that operate at the scale of Comcast. Even fewer that have frontline interaction with their customers. They understand the end-to-end of media and managed services.
good,good company I enjoyed working for this company the job relocated
good,I learned a lot just shadowing the event manager. Great first internship experience.
good,Excellent growth and opportunity for persons with a Bachelor's degree or higher. Competitive energetic environment.

good,overall good company to work for. fast paced constant changes however pay is decent but plenty of opportunity to make commission if you put in the work.
good,"Comcast is a stable place to work , the company does  try to make conditions better. Pay is ok, benefits are better. Fast paced . They train you to do jobs the way they want ."
good,Comcast stressful because of the clients. they call for dumb reason. and some will keep you on the phone for a long time. by a certain amount of time you will be stress out
good,I feel my pay at 20.53 per hour helps keep my family stable but they took overtime away for us a few months back so it has been more of a struggle. Small amount of pto that you use for personal and sick time. If you don’t come in and you do not have any pto you get what’s called a UAP which if you get 3 you’re fired and they don’t fall off for 6 months. So if something happens you’re out of luck. Micromanagement within every day also really affects the environment.
good,"Typical Day"
good,Work atmosphere was average.  There wasn't much room to advance because the higher ups were clicky.  I loved working here because I met so many people in the sports industry.
good,I worked at the company over 20 years. I wish Comcast could go back in time to recognizing people for great service that is provided to our customers instead of recognizing people by sheer numbers! That would make a HUGE difference in customer service!
good,"Ok, great company to work for. We needed more freedom to explore opportunities outside the box, and not feel that whatever creative development you create belongs to them. Ownership of your thought and creativity belongs to you, and no one should dismiss you if you don't allow them to take it."
good,"surrounding with awesome team I work with, amazing supervisors, managers, an organized team and so helpful.                      "
good,Customer service is the most important service we want to offer customers.  The company has invested time and money into programs that will help us raise scores on customer surveys.
good,I was hurt and my position was dissolved so I couldn't receive workman's comp I would have said it was the best job I had except they left me messed up I couldn't walk but threw the grace and mercy of God I've got myself back in working form no thanks to them great place to work underhanded when it comes to being fare
good,"Comcast was a fun and productive job. However, I worked under an IBO and I disagreed a little with the way I was paid, but, that did not have anything to do with the company itself."
good,Fun place to work great work in sales enviorment ......the manager are under alot of pressure and a they push their agents too much ..it can be a very unprofessional way
good,Management requires more experience in certain roles. High turnover rate lacks in management being properly placed in the proper management role. I have learned in almost 4 years big lack in experience of knowlege transfer.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Comcast. I was a sales representative (door to door sales) which happened to be my first sales job. Great pay, but poor leadership. I was able to make over $40,000 in about five months. If you are self driven and know how to manage your time, then this job might work for you. Very competitive and daily changes in products and services. Overall great company!"
good,Comcast is a great company. However the experience turn sour because of leaderships inability to think forward.  This caused a lot of conflict  and forced many to pamper the bad apples.
good,"Great company, great benefits People treat you well, company offers good pay and benefits"
good,"It was okay for the time being, however at little stressful. I ended up having to leave for health issue. Training for 2 weeks before hitting the floor. Big building can kind of get lost."
good,"wasn't as what I expected, not good management, everyone want to secure their position and they will stab you to keep them selfs, its kinda stressful work environment."
good,"Had the rug pulled out from underneath my feet. Otherwise, had no complaints at all - was a super place, with super people! Great atmosphere, great benefits, no complaints!"
good,"Comcast has great benefits, and fair pay and incentives. I worked for 10 years with the company and was happy to work at the Oak Brook location. I would recommend it to other people."
good,"It was a lot of work and I had wished it paid a lil more. The job had its ups and downs but it was a good company to work for. I learned about team work, and how to not lean so much on mgmt."
good,Started in a call center then they closed our center but was offered to work from home did that but was never able to advance within the company. Would constantly change goals and methods with little warning
good,You go door 2 door from 1-9 pm every day but little time for family and friends. it's hard to do anything on the weekends with the family because you have to work on the weekends and they want you to work also on your days off
good,My job was very interesting.  Excellent training program when you first start.  Personnel was good but atmosphere with co-workers was terrible.  Too much Drama.  Talking with customers was most of the time very enjoyable.
good,"Offer great benefits and the yearly income is great, but Job Security is very low. At Comcast we are a large family and everyone are very close."
good,Work as a team and help each other on duties of job. I learned how to run cables in houses or commercial type buildings. You have open door policies that can help you on what's on your mind.
good,"It was a pleasure to work and learn as a Network Infrastructure Technician at Comcast. I had the pleasure of working with some great co-workers and customers on a daily bases. I love my JOB! The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with my fellow technicians and completing installations or configurations of devices, and seeing big smiles on the customer's faces. Resolving job tickets was one of my greatest joys, as well as interacting and working with a great team each and everyday."
good,Comcast is a good company to work for. they have great benefits however there pay rate is not compatible with others. They constantly changing there is no stability as far as your job title. The metrics are constantly changing and you job title is constantly changing. Job advancement is based on who you know and not what you know
good,"This company is great place to work,if your willing to work hard. The sales position requires employees to work with little to no supervision. The management was fair, there's a decent working enviorment. The hardest part of this job was keeping up my endurance and meeting sales goals."
good,retail wireless store manager pretty much dealt with store operations and customer service issues
good,"Comcast is a very good company to work for.  They take care of their employees, and there is some room for advancment.  I would say that every area is different.  Some areas have a view on your advancment, and others do not."
good,"-Answering inbound calls to collect comcast equipment"
good,"It was very enjoyable to work there, I learned how to process monthly budgets, and process order for for the monthly leases for new/current tenants. The managers were all nice and good to work with. All the co workers were good as well."
good,"There was no typical day at work, every day was different with no idea what to expect."
good,"The actual job, company and benifits were great, however the department heads could use training on how to talk to and treat employee's. The overall experience was appreciated and I had some excllent coworkers."
good,"I supervised eighteen Technicians. I ensured telephone services were provisioned on time. I wrote yearly employee’s evaluations. I made decisions regarding hiring, evaluation, promotion and termination of employees or made related recommendation that were given particular weight."
good,"Learned how to promote at different events, did alot of voice over work, worked with alot of management, got along with all my co-workers, there was really nothing hard about the job because I loved doing it. Everything, the people where great all the giveaways, traveling being on the radio, lots of fun, script writing."
good,The company is a cool place to work the only problems is the raise structure is not up to par. The job itself is fine and the hours of operation don't allow you to live a normal life.
good,"Answered inbound calls regarding technical questions and problem resolution to products and equipment, responsible for electronic bill payments and answering questions related to billing statements and payment concerns, set up trouble calls and applied credit as needed."
good,It was a great place to work and you became part of a team which was like being at a home away from home
good,"I was in an outsourced company that handles customers calling in regards to data usage. Usually leaving customers satisfied with services provided. As such, compensation and benefits were limited"
good,I started working for Comcast in 2012. I can say working for an employer like this has been very interesting. Some people fail to realize that Tv & internet services are more of a luxury then they are a necessity. It also taught me patience. I love my Supervisor he is awesome but its time for me to expand my horizon.
good,"Comcast has been very good to me in the past 7 years.  I only wish their were more project management opportunities in my state. I have received a lot of guidance and direction on taking my career to the next level, and now I am looking to exercise the things I have learned while continuing to grow."
good,"Hours are good, could be better if I had a 9-5 schedule but hey, it is what it is. Management is good. They treat people good. No complaints there. I would highly recommend"
good,"Comcast is a great company to work for with plenty of room for advancement. "
good,"Comcast is an amazing company to work for, Benefits are great and start on Day 1 with the company. The progression for promotion and raises are slow; if you are an above average employee and your peer is a below average employee, both of you will still receive the same pay rate and promotion at the same time."
good,Great company to work for if your about your business and is willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done. They will work with you if you have any problems or family issues.
good,"You get up to 3 raises a year. The health insurance is good,  the 401k company match is up to 6%, everyone is celebrated for who they are... the most inclusive company I have ever worked for. Zero tolerance for bullying. Incentives are fair and commissions are paid monthly as well as a quarterly bonus."
good,It was amazing fun i had got to send emails help clients and customers on the phone . i also had great pay with amazing supervisors who wanted to help improve the work force
good,"The job is pretty easy. Great money potential without much experience needed. The job can be a little tiring, also have to be able to think on your feet. The job is always changing"
good,Comcast is a great company to work for.  creates a great culture to be around and to build. However most director & above positions are hired externally which creates a silo'd effect for manager across the board.  This lack of growth and development is an area of opportunity that if addressed it can keep its top talent.
good,"Knocking on doors all day until people allow you in their homes so that you can sell the Comcast products. Takes a very determined person to work through the winter. Great classes to learn how to close deals, management is sometimes poor. Great coworkers to work with."
good,"Comcast is a fun place to work. You get to meet different people everyday doing outside sales.The pay is excellent, The staff is helpful. When I first started with comcast, the team was very helpful., They did not mind answering questions."
good,"Doing door to door sales was greatly compensated, there were changes in the structure to pay less for the work unfortunately."
good,Comcast is like a family company when you come in its like you was home the people are very friendly we play game compete with other teams management push you to do better and tell you its ok if you feel that your not doing good for that day team work make the dream work ..
good,"Great place to work and grow as a technician. There are a ton of career advancements, but I will advise getting into a development role is near impossible unless you know someone currently in that role."
good,"I must say that going to work is safe because the company provide shuttle service, they allow employees to choose their schedule as long as the employees do their best at work. The management takes care of all the employees and they make sure that everyone is working at their best, they don't do spoon-feeding, the reason why employees chooses to stay, for the company helps not only me as an employee, but also the needs of my family."
good,Telesales is a sales position where you will provide the current customer with information that will usually benefit them but can be frustrating if they do not take advantage of the opportunity
good,"A typical day of work consists of a lot of research and hours. Thus, reviewing and tracking the sales success of each rep and ensuring I am doing my best to help them succeed."
good,"Throughout my employment with Comcast,, past 10 years has been a great experience.  Unfortunately, the company had to restructure and over 500 employees were laid off last year, The biggest challenge was that upper management was disconnected with front line employees and lost the relationships/communication with employees."
good,"Since I was the type of person that could blend easily with different people, I would always make acquaintances in different departments that my customer would at some point interact with. Once I get a grasp of positive and negative interactions from my customers I would have meetings with supervisors and manager on the various complaints and then offer my solutions. This made my job a little more fun since you can see a change occur in the system for the better knowing you played a role in that. If you come into a job thinking this is all I can do, then you will hate it. Sometimes you need to think big picture."
good,"Just need to accomodate employees a little better. Over all my expierience was fine and i was able to gain knowledge that I did not possess before, I just feel because of all the assignment and task I had to do, I was not compensated accordingly."
good,With any call enter of course comes changes. BUT the changes there are often and not well thought through. It does not benefit the rep. Everything hat is placed in plan supposed to benefit the customer but somehow that back fires and that plan does not always go as plan. Some of the plans should be well thought through.
good,"•	Responsible for answering incoming calls regarding sales rep questions and problem resolution related to customer accounts while using a customer service approach to providing information"
good,"I am very proud to be working for a great company such as Comcast. They have so much to offer their employees in terms of benefits. More than I have ever experienced at any other company. I was thrilled to be offered a position at Comcast. The downside is the horrible manager I have at the moment and that's why I am looking for something else. My previous manager was wonderful and empowered you and supported you. My current one has no people skills and is just a very mean person. Also, employees receive bonuses 4 times a year EXCEPT certain job titles and unfortunately I am one of them and I think it's a completely unfair practice as do others in this situation. We work just as hard as everyone else in the company."
good,"TRAVELED TO CUSTOMERS homes to install services. the company is very social and easy to get along with co workers.had a take home truck, with tools and equipment to do the job."
good,Comcast is a great company to work for a lot of benefits for the employees. for being the front line and smile of the company. as we know consumers can be very direct when it comes to their internet tv and phone. Xfinity store sales associates are the smile and the front line.
good,"Worked daily on reviewing Splunk log outputs. Dashboard development, SPL scripting, daily email to management conveying health of the project. Monitor and maintained OpV Report Dashboard."
good,"I work Monday through Friday 8AM to 5PM."
good,"This was a good company to work for. Comcast is great at rewarding their workers. The supervisor in which I was under was never there to help out with stressful customers or anything else. The fact that the commission was good and based off of how much you was working was good, but when you receive it the hourly wages where taken away through taxes."
good,"Great company to work for and great benefits. Lots of time off, room for advancement, and competitive salary. Great company to choose for a career opportunity."
good,"Overall Comcast has been a great place to work. I would refer friends and family to Comcast. Lounge, gym and café in the new location in Colorado are great benefits."
good,"Working for Xfinity Comcast was a great pleasure. Being a salesperson is definitely a great skill to have in almost any field but it isn't cut out for everyone. You have to be willing to take criticism as well as plenty of rejection. I luckily had a great manager that taught me about positioning and all the ins and outs of being a sales contractor. But just keep in mind for every 100 no's you get in a day, you will get at least 1 yes."
good,I strived to be the best from the very beginning my time at comcast was filled with up and down periods. But overall I was able to excel in changing senerio.
good,"If you are looking for a good technical work, it is best place. Good technical workforce with latest technology expertise. You get guidance from senior people and technical architects."
good,A great place to work very consistent across the board. Great atomsphere to showcase your talents.  Subscribers are generally happy with service and when they call in as well
good,Comcast is a good job to have they take their employees seriously. have upgraded to make the call center more enjoyable to work in. Also management has opted to help get the employees promoted
good,My experience at Comcast was a good one. I enjoyed helping customers as a Customer Account Executive. I was able to communicate with them over the phone and in person. I found it to be fairly easy because I was selling and servicing a product that I like and continue to use on a regular basis.
good,Comcast is a fun company to work for.  The pay is decent and the benefits are good.  I do not like the fact that they change your shift once a year based upon the needs of the business.  The only problem is that the shift may not give you the work life balance you need.
good,Comcast is a great place to work.  During my time their as a technician i found it was difficult to become recognized for promotion no matter how much you go above and beyond.
good,I have been working with Comcast for about 2 years now and I can honestly say that I have been very happy with my decision. The work environment/company culture is very positive and makes the work day enjoyable.
good,Comcast can be a wonderful place to work as long as you are willing to sell to the elderly who cannot afford it and think of solely your own check and not the well being of your customer. Selling is huge here without it you do not have a job.
good,"Good company to work, every thing o.k, Great benefits, HR is very help, very considerate and work with you. please try to work for them"
good,"great work place and i love it there, i felt so relax. love the managers."
good,Its an o k place to work.Management need to work on their attitudes and the need to find a better training method.looks like they need to revamp their hiring process.
good,"Comcast is a great company to work for, the work environment was great and they are always training their employees. I would recommend Comcast to anyone who wants to improve their customer service skills."
good,Comcast has the best telecommunications products in the industry.  I enjoy overcoming objectives and winning customers back.
good,"I loved the company, Comcast and all of my co-workers, supervisors and management. I worked in the beginning at the call center doing over-the-phone repair of high speed internet and VoIP, then the company shifted to video repair, and once again to what was called AMT (appointment management transfer) in which customers would call if they had a technician scheduled that day to get an ETA, if they missed the technician we would reschedule and in some instances be able to get a technician back out same day. Late last year of 2015 they implemented an all encompassing call center in Knoxville where agents were to do any over-the-phone repairs if they had a technician within 24 hours as well as AMT duties. Only 5% of Comcast customers call in a year. Out of those 5% usually around 75-80% can be fixed by walking the customer through simple troubleshooting. Those where a technician are needed 97% arrive within the two hour window. Of the remaining 3% it is where the technician may be arriving late, but what is often the case are the calls I and my fellow agents received where the technician said he called but called the wrong phone number and there would be no available tech to go back out that day and we would have to reschedule for sometimes four or five days out. The same would happen often where the technician said he went to the job but nobody was there and dispatch would require us to reschedule the call. Myself and other agents would have to be the messengers of this news to the customer, many of whom had taken the day off for the technician. Ultimately the negativity of those"
good,"Fun place to work, great teamwork and customer friendly.  I would scan tickets, seat guests, work the lawn and provide crowd control"
good,"An average day at work starts early in the morning with tons of spam, phishing , firewall, and DMCA reports that I respond too until the incoming calls begin to flood us. During down time I follow up on my call back , issue warnings and make subscribers aware of the policy when violated."
good,"I just started this job and I like this job and what I do. I also just love my co workers, they are great, they helped me with a lot and walked me through some of the stuff and I get along with each of them really well. The hardest part of this job is that we have a new way of taking and making payments and the Kiosk does not give change back and most of the customers that come in and then they find out no change is given back, customers get upset and don't want to make their payment at the Kiosk. The most enjoyable part about the job is learning all the different things about Comcast cable and what they have to provide and offer."

good,"A great place to learn, work and grow while people still can have a good work life balance."

good,A few bad managers can influence sales in a negative manor more than the higher ups realize.
good,"learned alot about cable great co-workers crazy hours too busy "
good,"Solid company, good working environment, 30 hours is full time ,"
good,"Comcast was a call center that handled troubleshooting issues. One operator could receive up to 100 calls a shift. I learned to be very patient with the customers. After having many problems with their services, they just needed some one to take it out on. My co-workers were great. We all pitched in to help one another. The hardest part about Comcast was management. The most enjoyable was talking to different people from many states and learning how Comcast did or did not work in their area."
good,Never knowing if you would have a job in the morning comcast is known to fire whole departments at short notice in order to get what they want
good,Great benefits and overall great company to work for.   I have been with this company for 4 years and it has been a great experience.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of"
good,"*Handle individual customer's needs one at a time, be it billing, services, transfers of services"
good,"Comcast is a company that is worth working for.  The benefits are great, the other employees are great and if I didn't move, I would still be working there."
good,"Typical day would be arrival in the office around 10am in order to take care of administrational tasks (checking sales in system of former day, making sure installations of customers are still on track for that day, reading e-mails to make sure I'm aware of latest updates before I go into the field). 'The field' is assigned territory where Comcast expects us to knock every door of non-customers in order to inform and hopefully convert that particular person to Comcast cable, TV and phone services. Time in the field spent is between about noon-8pm. Doing this job I have learned to fine-tune sales techniques. I enjoyed working with management and co-workers, which is important especially in this type of position. Keeping each other motivated is everything. The hardest part would be the fact that you never know who's house you're entering (especially being a woman) plus the job requires us to be outside for at least 6 hrs a day, knocking doors regardless the weather conditions."
good,"coordination of learning and development "
good,This is a very nice place to work.  Compensation is competive and you are allow to post for internal jobs.  
good,"Clock in and have a 10 minute prep time, take inbound calls for the rest of the day with a 30 minute lunch. I learned about time management and my co workers were very supportive when it came to learning the material.The hardest part of the job was learning about pro rates for billing issues. The most enjoyable part was upselling products."
good,My typical day at Comcast is very interesting and challenging. My job description is upgrading existing customers with ending promotion to new promotion as well as new services. Maintaining customers’ service satisfaction is the number one priority. The challenging part of the job is the meet company monthly sale quota which varies each month.
good,"Management was very nice, but only cared about the money. Needs to hire more people and not be stingy, also needs more diversity in the company."
good,Overall Comcast is a good place to work. However it is a strict workplace environment.
good,"Assist customer with their internet, telephone, cable accounts. Troubleshoot with getting their service working. Assist with their billing, setup appointments for new installation and for repairs on our equipment. Took over 100 calls daily. Call center environment. Advise of billing cycle process checks and credit cards payments. Selling such as channels, DVR, HDTV, Digital boxes and upgrading to digital service."
good,"A typical day at work was high intensity once you logged into your computer. Dispatching techs for installations and trouble calls came first, then addressing priority emails while taking incoming calls from potential business subscribers. Coordinating installation times with subscribers and submitting reports for the manager's profit and loss (P&L) reports."
good,"They are a company that wants to see you suceed, if that is what you want to do. They offer programs to help you become more efficent with all of the products."
good,"Comcast is a great place to work, very professional, great environment, great culture."
good,"This is a great company, great networking opportunities, innovative things going on in the industry, and locations all over."
good,Comcast Corporation is an excellent company to work for. They offer great benefits and the opportunity for advancement if you are willing to re-locate.
good,Great company Great benefits and a very diverse company with lots of great people to work for. I just need a more work life balance for my fsmily. I’ve enjoyed my years at Comcast and I would recommend this company to others
good,"I was elated when I landed an entry level job with Comcast. The family oriented culture makes the company a joy to work for. The benefits are outstanding and work life balance is good. Maternal / paternal leave is better than current standards and the company accommodates you with flexible days for days one may succumb to illness. Although my enthusiasm faded a bit with time, my experience is positive."
good,"This was my first direct sales job. Its tough enough going door to door, at the time there was a two week sales cycle which was really challenging. They've since gone to a full month cycle. Really good pay if you can deal with the day to day stress of approaching homes unannounced to meet your sales goals."
good,I enjoeyed my time here at comcast. The benefits and support of the company is great. I am able to wrok form home and have office meetings when needed.
good,"The company as a whole is great, highly recommend. Respectable pay, great training, good benefits. The local office was not well managed and was one of the bottom performers in the entire company, but this was not the norm and upper management was moving to make changes when I left."
good,Great place to work absolutely love my job and my team have no serious problems within the company communication could be better but it had plenty of opportunities to advance.
good,"This company allows a lot of opportunity, since it is affiliated with NBCUniversal there are many perks to enjoy for you and your family. Many free learning opportunities as well. Constantly changing so you never stop adapting and learning."
good,great place to work at but not for everyone. requires a lot of physical work and outdoor all day. picking up and handling an 80 pound ladder constantly throughout the day
good,Must kiss butt to move around because no matter how good you are at the job if you don’t kiss some butt and y’all to the right people u will remain a tech for ever in the company.
good,Comcast is a great company to work for. The benefits are out of this world. They are a company that believes and invests in their emoloyees. The only negative thing I would say about the company is that they should restructure their PTO time which should include sick time because sickness is something one cannot plan for.
good,Great company for growth and development inclusive and diverse work environment. Room for growth comparable compensation and benefits package overall great place to work.
good,on any kind of day this job can be fun challenging depending on the day. The management and customers varies. most importantly i have enjoyed making clients happy and performing well to the best of my ability
good,I loved agile methodology here and my team was AWESOME.  Probably the whole reason why I loved working at comcast.  I was a contractor though so it was tough not having benefits.
good,"Comcast offers great benefits, not much room for growth in the retail side of the company. You have the ability to make a lot of money with the unlimited commission within sales, which is a plus."
good,"On a typical day at comcast you will help customers get into the best package that fits them most.I learned a sales environment is very competitive but also very fun at the same time, management was helpful most of the time. Always looking to coach you and give you constructive criticism in the best way possible. The hardest part of my job was de-escalating angry customers and being as patient as possible with them. The best part of my job is meeting monthly goals and over driving them."
good,Started as a tech after a few years i was able to advance to a supervisor position. my job was to route jobs to twenty different technicians with different skill levels. routing to different areas threw out the portland metro area. other job titles were daily correspondence with managers in response to field related issues with customers an or techs.most of the day would be spent in the field handling technicians with issues they can't handle or doing my call backs on customer issues in the field. end of the day is was my job to make sure ever tech was completing there entire route every day.
good,Is not bad to work for comcast is Not dificult to make a sale
good,"It's good, if you can get FTE, do it's positioning itself as more than a utility, more than an entertainment company, but also a budding technology company. It's very open to new ideas and technology."
good,Great company to work for and you can learn a lot of different job fields while working at Comcast through Comcast University. They provide you with all of the equipment you need to perform your duties.
good,Career options are endless.  They recognize that the employees are vital to their success.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the tremendous teamwork.  Teamwork makes the dream work.
good,Comcast leads in technical innovation in the cable and internet domain. Great opportunities for people to grow and explore other roles within the organisation.
good,"I am satisfied with my current career with Comcast, being here nearly 7 years. After so long, however, sometimes change is needed and can be exactly what someone needs to further their career and life."
good,Comcast NBCUniversal is an awesome company. They have great products and services and a great work culture. The leadership team makes great strategic decisions for the company.
good,Good Company to work for and Comcast as a company is getting better. Great Products and want to sincerely take care of its employees and customer client.
good,Always an exciting work environment everyone there was always positive and helpful. Everyday was centered around providing the best deal for our customer base.
good,"Although the environment was cut throat, I""d go back in a heart beat.  Easily one of the best places I've worked at and the pay was excellent.  Working over nights can be a drag but I got used to it.  If you can stand it, you'll make a fortune.  Excellent facility with loads of over communication.  Too bad there are some bad attitudes floating around."
good,very competitive enviroment with lots of reconitions and bonuses. they would have competitions that would allow you to increase your income. Quartally luncheon given to give reconitions to those who hit or exceeded their quotas.
good,"positive working place with good workers "
good,Gained a lot of experience. Comcast invest a lot in the development of their employees. I enjoyed my time there. I would go back if a position opens up that interest me.
good,"I worked for a sub contractor.  "
good,I honestly thought that this was an opportunity to come back to Delaware and really apply my public relations degree on the front line. I did for a long time correcting accounts providing excellent customer service. But after not being promoted and not being promoted it just took a toll your giving 150 200 percent and people new hires are coming in giving 75 for less than a year and getting more responsibility and or promoted. So let's talk about this I offered on every call the callers had to be verified. I did it for a long time and respect the company and work like to work there again.
good,computer work. helping technicians and people. changing environment. customer service over phone. helpful people. handling upset customers. nice people to work with.
good,"It was a great place to work! Great people, benefits, & bonuses. "
good,Working at Comcast is fast paced. You get developmental sessions with supervisors/managers that can help you not only step up your performance but help you advance within the company. Most departments encourage teamwork.
good,"Nice place to get your foot in the door and discounted products like tv ,internet lots of time off cool people to work with and management is understanding"
good,i do not feel like explaining all of that. i dont work there anymore. they were a good company. so people should apply that need jobs. the schedules are not good tho
good,i loved working there the structure to advancement isn't ideal. great company benefits weight out the junk they put you through but overall keep head low and work. If you get a good manager your great. they do care...
good,"Your pay was base only on what you sold. That can be good or bad one week you can make 50.00 ontheotherhand, you can make 1000.00 it depends on how long you were willing to work."
good,"fast paced"
good,"It was an upbeat work place that had big lunch break rooms with ping pong and other games. Always something going on in the center for everyone to enjoy, lots of managers around that you could go up to at any time, the hardest part of the job is trying to overcome hurdles when we didn't have the right tools"
good,"Start my day getting all screens pulled that I will need to assist the customers. taking inbound calls from customer and some outbound calls for follow ups. My last job was an excellent learning opportunity and I developed my skills and experience in numerous different ways.my employer introduced several different excel programs. this gave me the opportunity to undertake additional training which we used day to day basis, as a result I had been consistently rewarded for hard work with promotions and increased responsibilities. Comcast culture is very diverse. I cant  say there was a hard part. I am a very detailed person and set  high expectations on my work performance . The most enjoyable  part of the job definitely was being able to give exceptional customer service care to  all my customers."
good,New supervisors can be trained better / favoritism is definitely an issue./ manager is excellent supervisors not so much / really stressful when you go up to a supervisor that does not know how to do their job .
good,"Benefits were terrific.  Best part of the job was dealing with customers and planning special events.  Worse part, meetings to include web meetings.  Learned great listening skills.  Typical day was either dealing with customers or government officials as well as the local media. Really enjoyed initiating special events."
good,Worked as an intern for a Summer Internship which opened my eyes to the possibilities of graphic design and motion graphics. Great place. Great people.
good,"typical call center job"
good,Comcast is now a great player in the MVNO space and I have had the pleasure of working with them to launch as Xfinity Mobile. I think they will do very well at providing a great experience to new and existing customers.
good,Work atmosphere is laid back and fun. They upper management cares about its employees. Great pay per hour and plenty of opportunities for advancement.
good,"Was an intern so didn't really deal with compensation or any benefits but everything about the company was fantastic.  Loved the people, loved the jobs I was assigned.  Wished I could have worked there longer but had to go back and finish school."
good,"we did a lot of live sports, college football, Major League baseball, and soccer, live all the time, doing live  shows was fun and very fast paced, enjoy doing live sports"
good,"Great place to work and build and retire from. THE GREATEST gift they will offer you is free services example ~free cable, internet and phone/ and alarm services."

good,Extremely hard-working professional skilled in meeting a deadlines and requirements while working in a fast-paced environment. A person committed to delivering high quality support that exceeds expectations.
good,"I have spent about 5 years at Comcast, I've created a family there.   Its required of me to work once a week twice a month, this allows me to pay my school tuition."
good,Comcast offers great benefits.  The work life is overloaded.  There is always an atmosphere of uncertanty regarding job security.  It is very difficult to advance.
good,great training good place to work competitive atmosphere progressive thinking among managers fantastic benifits and bonuses if ur on the sales side of business commissions are great
good,"The hours are hard for a single mother. There is great job security and a lot of room to move up. I think that if there was options for better scheduling that this would be a ideal place to work, or if you are a single person with no kids."
good,"Overall, the job is good to have. If you're not into sales, this is not the job for you. You are on the phone for 4.5 hours trying to upgrade current cable subscribers to receive internet and home phone services. Rewards are given for meeting your monthly sales goals. The hardest part of the job is selling to angry and dissatisfied customers. The most enjoyable part is providing a thorough knowledge of products to the customer for a better customer service experience."
good,I have little bad to say about my time at Comcast. I love my job my co-workers. management is approachable and Very Reasonable. The only issue I have is the transition to being about the customer experience seems very fake to me. I was or am in a sales position however it is also a front line customer service position. I find it counter productive how they preach about improving the customer experience while the sole emphasis on my being able to continue my employment really hinges on reaching Sales Goals. It is because of this I feel that the pressure for those sales hurts my ability to provide the best customer service and since I am someone that wants to help someone over sell to increase my wealth by creating a false need to have a product to a customer that has already said they do not want it or even worse they cannot afford it. I would love to have a position that does not have any sales goals that would allow me to help people and not have any type of sales metric but I have yet to find that job within the company.
good,Comcast is definitely an equal opportunity employer. It is a great place to start at entry level and build a career at. A place that hard work and determination will pay off.
good,I enjoyed working for Comcast. I learned a lot working for Comcast. Management was there for me anytime I needed them. Ending a service call with a satisfied customer was the best part of the job.
good,"The only reason I had to leave was because they could not offer me a full time position.  The people I worked with became my second family, I never dreaded going into work."
good,"I have enjoyed my 16 years at Comcast for the most part and gained a great deal of knowledge for the first 5 years of my time here. "
good,"Met and exceeded monthly collection and customer retention goals. "
good,"Learned the meaning of customer service, co-workers were great."
good,"Comcast is very good place to work.  Scheduling and manager are great.  Everyone so helpful and very eager to see you grow, as what we call all employee, a good Comcaster."
good,"Very friendly and customer oriented company. Due to the company outsourcing the majority of call centers overseas, the employment became very unstable. I was not in a position to constantly move my family from city to city and state to state."
good,great opportunities to advance in the company ; great customer service and computer skills Ive learned and kept up with on a daily basis.Hard dealing with angry customer but you do develop thick skin.
good,"I enjoyed Comcast, the only reason I left was the fact that it was not in my field of study. I would have stayed if a position had opened up doing what I wanted to do."
good,"Results driven culture"
good,This is a great company to work for. It just depends on the office you're working in as far as culture. That's just how it is no matter where you work. It's all about the people.
good,"A lot of phone calls, and a lot work getting done, but a lot of satisfaction at the end when you realize how many people you helped. Great working atmosphere. Everyone was friendly as well."
good,"Running reports, I have learned pivot tables. my coworkers were easy going, team players. I adapt to daily challenges. the environment was enjoyable."
good,"Comcast was a great place to work. It was exciting to be a part of a team that was task with taking on a pilot program called Xfinity Home. I was apart of a team of 20 individual divided up between the City and the suburbs. Our mission was to grow the Home Security brand of Comcast by consulting customers on the benefits and features. We were also task with driving up install completion percentage. Over the course of 2 years we drove that percentage from and average of 62% to 75% to 80%. We was able to do this I believe because we was able to fully engage and education customers on their home security systems. We also had the opportunity to increase sales production through equipment up sell."
good,Great company. Manage and monitor 5 different network channels. Coworkers are probably some of the best anyone will come by. Very low key environment yet they want to make sure you learn and excel in the position.
good,"Installed, program, and troubleshoot networking equipment in commercial locations. "
good,"I oversea California Business Technicians , Dealing with Customer and issues with their services . I mainly focus on keeping good Communication between The customer and Our company. Every day is a learning experience because we deal with Cable and that is one of the most rewarding part of this job to be able to deal with issues and challenges. I will have to say the hardest part of the job is not been recognized as much and the paying is not that great. The most enjoyably part of my job is working with great people different cultures and knowing that you are great at what you do"
good,Fun and challenging job to have in the cable industry. Definitely fulfilling career to have a management role in a company to help make a difference in peoples lives.Hardest part of the job was time management due to high demands of the business.
good,"Comcast was over all a great place to work, it was very stressful at times. It was one of those places that you have to always keep a positive attitude about. People I worked with was great. Hardest part for me was the scheduling."
good,"get in your work vehicle and go to work straight from your home most of the time ... fast long days ... sometimes into the night ,,, with their current system ,,, installs have got to be surgical !!!! or the product doesnt wotk  as it should .... customer care  very important......  as a tech u must have great people skills  to compensate for the mistakes of the ordering process of the sales  people ... but all in all its a great job...."
good,"Answering incoming calls dealing with billing, up selling and technical  support for phone, internet and video products"
good,"Taking calls for customers with issues with either cable TV, internet or phone. Also did sales when appropriate. I learned how to better trouble shoot computers, cable lines, DNS servers, etc. Management was great. I was fortunate to have two great managers at Comcast. Made great friends. Hardest part of job was getting more and more responsibility with out raises. Most enjoyable part was helping customers find solutions to their problems."
good,"i loved coming to intern at CSN everyday because all of the full time workers there brought me in like i was one of their own."
good,"Good Health Benefits and free cable internet & phone & Security  system , Great People to Work with"
good,helping customer with their inquiries was gratifying.Excellent compensation and benefits..Management was poor and left alot to be desired
good,"Call center- sales, retention, tech support, billing, general office duties."
good,Daily tasks include outbound warm and cold calling to SMB. Daily paperwork and organization. Must be detail oriented and able to work in an ever changing environment. I enjoy most every aspect of my job.
good,Great place to work. So many different aspects of the company so a wide variety of employment opportunities.  I have had some of the best leadership in my professional career.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to resolve customer issues and concerns and the hardest part of the job is when policies & proceduresd are not the same for all  customers in a designated area. I learned that working with customers can be challenging and you can't please every customer, but you communicate effectively and build rapport wih customers."
good,The only problem I have is the compensation. You deal with  alot of people.
good,I really liked working at Comcast for several reasons. One of which is the people I met on a daily basis. I pride myself on my customer service skills and at Comcast I utilized these skills everyday.
good,"My typical work day as a CAE was basically assisting with inbound calls.  The call could be related to sales or service.  My job duties were to assist the customers with existing service, offer sales/products to callers, troubleshoot with caller when related to service calls, setup new service for new customers.  The hardest part of my job was troubleshooting with customers.  The most enjoyable part of my job was sales."
good,"Good company to work for on the west coast, different story in the mid west."
good,"Excellent place to work, great benefits, very good insurance. Friendly employees to work with."
good,"Enjoyed working near the coast beach cool weather."
good,"As an Executive Assistant, this was exhilarating.  Personally, I truly enjoyed the challenge of learning new software applications, administration needs and expectations for (3) executives at one time.  They understood this was my new role, but once I caught on, I was efficient.  I learned how to anticipate the needs of my superiors and efficiently execute them.  I learned how to multitask, designate responsibility, and communicate with different departments and personnel on all levels."
good,"My day consists of problem solving, analysis of call volume,call routing and agent skilling."
good,"If you are one to excel in sales, this is the job for you.  Busy during collection periods, lots of knowledge to retain.  Great team of people to work with and I loved working with the public."
good,Things in the Marketing department can turn on a dime.  The team I worked with not only was able to step up to the plate but made the quick decisions to make it work.
good,"I worked in a fast paste hard core sales environment,door to door, via phone sales. With existing and none existing customer of Comcast/ Xfinity, we upgraded them and or offered a competitive sales offer. Comcast is backed by a customer service guarantee, thus having us employees work exemplary weather it be face to face interaction with the customer interaction, and or inbound out bound calls. Filled out service orders, made customer very knowledgeable of the products they have in the home, thus following FCC and Comcast regulations.  "
good,Handling incoming calls from customers about their service or setting up new service. Also answering any general questions customers may call in about.
good,Comcast was a great experience to my ability to sell door to door. There is a lot of employee funded travel involved.

good,• Check status of Tech’s for customers
good,Great place to start a career and many options to advance if you’re in the right state . Great benefits for employees and flexible schedules for employees.
good,What can I say.  The work is hard but the people are great.  Wish I didn't have to relocate or I would still be at Comcast.  They have great benefits and they provide activities.
good,I have worked for Comcast as a sales consultant in a retail store for over a year. Over the period of time I’ve been with the company I have been very happy overall. However being a sales consultant in a store has lots of challenges. Customer service is one of those things which is easy for me although there is also the sales goals. The goals are often super high and out of reach. I only say this because they expect every customer to be happy and with that comes the struggle of making sales.
good,Very competitive environment   They need to focus on customer service   Individuals can do a great job but customer service can erase it all  by not doing their best  the company needs to focus on their customer a lot more
good,"This position was great, good benefits, great compensation and amazing location. Downside to this position on a personal level was the sales felt very used car salesmanish. Also would be berated by customer entering the facility daily."
good,"Comcast can be a great place to work at, depending on your department and specific role. The money isn't the best, but it's decent. The benefits are awesome!"
good,A quality group of people.  The environment is very professional and there are a lot of very talented people in leadership.  The general environment demands performance and people are treated respectfully.
good,Work life balance was great! Family oriented company. Easiest place I've ever worked. The company actually appreciate their employees. Great place for growth.
good,"great company needs better Commission rate and more job Advancement  "
good,I loved working at Comcast Business for 14 years and would love for Comcast to Purchase Mediacom in the Midwest and I would apply in a heartbeat! Great company!
good,"Great benefits for employees"
good,great place to work at the benefits are great for someone who is starting a family. You get plenty of overtime & quarterly bonuses that comes in handy at time
good,Comcast is a great company to work for but I still believe that favoritism is going on even though they have an outside company to take complaints.  the follow up with complaints are never founded
good,"Great place to work and expand your career. Additionally, there are always opportunities to become involved both inside and outside of the company through employee resource groups, mentorships, etc."
good,"Show up on time, try to learn the products as effectively as you can, and you will advance. If you take it upon yourself to learn as much as you can on job, and more off Job, you can easily move on to a higher level position."
good,"While still achieving my bachelor’s degree, NBC10 tv station hired me for part time traffic. At just 23 years old, they counted on me to produce graphics and report credible news"
good,Cable is profitable. Long time employees at Comcast are afraid to make any moves (rock the boat) in fear of losing their rich stock options. These people are a weight on profit but seldom are they promoted to customer as the mediocre have formed a force of evel to perpetuate their lack of productivity.
good,"Management will ""roll up their sleeves and get in the trenches,"" with their teams.  It is a welcome benefit and motivation to observe Management interest and involvement in the day-to-day function.  The culture is very fast paced with ""sprinkles of down time"" here and there.  Overall I enjoy my role and responsibilities, however compensation is lower in comparing to the industry.   Providing a more robust pay-for-performance program would be beneficial in attracting and retaining talent."
good,Learn alot.  Work as team.  Company cares for employess.  Very supportive.  Fast paced environment.  Education and training options.  Tuition reinbusement.
good,"A great place to work as regards to developing a career, the potential for advancement, benefits, pay, etc,"
good,"Good people. Difficult to work with customers who don't see the value in their services. Frequent changes in the comission structure that devalued the ability to earn. Overall, good managers that take care of their people."
good,"I started working in the call center as a billing clerk, but would still trouble shoot the cable. I always tried to be empathetic to the customers and go the extra mile.  I was happy to train for technical support because I personally learned so much about the internet and phone connections among other helpful information.  When a new job posted in Dispatch, I applied so I could experience another job at Comcast (and I had heard the pay was better).  "
good,"Inbound sales department was amazing until they drastically changed commission structure and they added cell phone sales.  Big hit in employees pockets. Living in South FL is super expensive.  I moved away due to this reason and cost of living "
good,It sucks if you are part time. If you don't make the commission it is not much of a paycheck. The managers are mostly nice.  The co workers are like a family atmosphere.
good,Comcast is a company with many divisions and opportunities to advance one's career.  Work/Life balance is very important to lots of people and Comcast is taking action to address this issue.
good,It has been an amazing experience working for Comcast.  I love my job and what I do.  Current position is in Sales.  There is a great feeling of control that I have in closing sales.  I was one of the top sales people 2 years in a row.  The insentives were absolutely wonderful.
good,"Comcast is a good company to work, but for the work that Technicians do, pay per hour is too low compared to other companies. Comcast provide good benefits, 401K, and courtesy services (cable, home security, etc)"
good,Great benefits  and perks for being an employee. Haven't learned too much that i didn't already know.  Hardest part of the job is the hours. seems like an ok place to work
good,I loved it. Felt like a home away from home. Always welcome to work. I love to eat and we always had food. Everyone helped each other to grow and make money.
good,"Management changed last year and made the work environment kind of hostile, but overall the job is great, the benefits are great, you are judged by your work"
good,"I manage taking 60 to 100 inbound calls daily. We resolve billing and technical issues.  I also upsell products and services. The atmosphere is very laid back; and we dress business casual."
good,Comcast Spotlight is a great place to work at. The environment is great and I learn a lot. There are a lot of great people and the atmosphere is one of a family. management and above are the problem when it comes to working there. They make changes that does not have any meaning.
good,I have nothing but the best to say about everything Comcast. I have worked extremely hard since being employed here and have been compensated very well for it all around.
good,"was a great place to work,nice people,pay good. able to have a life outside.Made great money.Office manager not so great but didn't have to see her so much"
good,This job was ok but did not pay enough.  I left due to competitive pay. They don't pay for degrees.  Manager did not know things and always had me call others to ask for help.
good,Working at Comcast offered a unique experience. I was stationed in one of Philadelphia's busiest Best Buy's. Tasked with the job of a greeting customers in various departments. Our objective was to converse with customers about Comcast products and services such as home internet and cable television. We also us old phone service as well.
good,Among the frontline employees we became a family and that never changed even when one of us left. I love that about the store is that we dont get along all the time but we are there for each other no matter what the situation is. You rarely hear about that in a work enviroment. The management was ok and they had their moments but it was more the employees. The hardest part of the job at times was the customers and they were the most enjoyable too.The job was one of the most fun enviroments that i have ever worked in.
good,Working at Comcast is a challenge but in the end if you put forth the effort then you will be rewarded. It takes lots of team effort but the goals can be reached and the progression is there if you choose to take it!
good,Great company to work for entry level position. The pay is not conducive to agony on the phones. The benefits are awesome and would keep you with the company a little longer than expected.
good,"As a direct sales representative it was very challenging to get the customers to switch to the Xfinity products, and with the winter hours it made it more difficult, but rewarding when a sale was generated."
good,Very friendly family oriented place to work with growth opportunities available. Room to pick from different departments to transfer too. Awesome benefits!!!
good,"I get to work with very smart technical and professional co-workers daily.  The company works hard to provide great products to it's customers, and cares a great deal about it's employees."
good,"It was a great place to work, but they restructured and eliminated the job I had.  I understand why but it still hurts.  "
good,"The daily job function depends on really what you are doing, or what you job function is, some are picking, some are getting CPE or lockers that all need to be done."
good,"I worked at Comcast for almost 4 years. I loved it there. They really were like my family. Everyone, my coworkers and managers alike were friendly and open. I was unsatisfied with the way job advancement was handled, though. I tried more than 23 times to apply for positions beyond those in the call center, because I was studying to become an accountant (Comcast paid for my tuition), and I kept getting rejected, despite having a good, clean record with the company. I even spoke to the call center director, and I explained to her that I had various interests and wanted to learn and grow with the company. In the end, nothing was done, and I ended up leaving. I wanted to grow, and they would not allow me the opportunity to grow with them. Oh well, I've been growing outside the company. It's otherwise a great place to work. I love the benefits!"
good,"great company to work for, I really enjoy working for Comcast. i recommend Comcast to work for. great benefit, especially having free services ! ......................."
good,"Overall fun ,exciting at same time challenging which I like. When you are a door to door (D2D) salesman we are just a different breed and our culture. We are one best when it comes to sales world. Our typical day starts with administrative work the office,follow up on all install the day before are completed . Follow up and make phone calls to hot leads, set appointments,confirm existing appointments, plan for the day and check for new promotions. More importantly always know where you stand in weekly and monthly goal. Meeting after that and you ready to go D2D. The great thing about D2D is that your not stuck in cubicle,you your own boss, you control your paycheck, take a brake when u want as long as follows company guidelines meaning x amount ok knocks,x amount of contacts and more importantly a sales. From the field you can go straight or back to the make more call or call which company provides. To sign out before 10pm turn in your numbers x knock,x contacts and x sales. Sign out from your iPad. Freedom!"
good,personally I loved working for Comcast not everybody does I love the environment and it was friendly to all that came by all walks of life worked there it was the first time I ever felt good working everyday
good,There is so much growth with the company they have great values. Making sure employees are well taking care of. Love the culture. Please do apply nice place to work.
good,"Challenging work environment.  That being said, the management team did many wonderful things to keep stress to a minimum, to instill a sense of camaraderie and to make everyone feel welcome."
good,I loved working at Comcast. The work was challenging and I made a lot of great friends. The benefits are top notch. I would highly recommend working there.
good,It was a wonderful place to work if the supervisors where trustworthy. The supervisors would lie on you make up things about you to get you fired and in the end they (the supervisor) would end up getting fired for lying about their number for the team they were supervising at the time.
good,Avoid a union location if you can - the wages are lower and the culture is distinctively different.  The training provided is mind-numbing and does not equip you for the actual day-to-day function of the job.  The job can be very stressful because customers have a long entrenched hatred of the company and they tend to take it out on the lowly associates in the retail store or call center.  I enjoy working for the company overall and the retail transformation is heading in the right direction.
good,Company vehicle and uniforms provided. Rotating schedules and plenty of time off. Advancement opportunities but mostly management. Community oreniented.
good,I work 10 hours a day 40 hours a week. Schedule appointments for member for tech to come. I work 40 hours in 4 days anything extra was overtime. I learn how to help techs with there issues on the job
good,"Though the pay and benefits were great, the management in Southern Indiana was in Turmoil. The front line management position remained vacant for extended periods of time. The location had a decaying technological infrastructure. Also, the many assigned areas were below the poverty line, which obviously impacted quota and potentiality for sales."
good,"I loved working there and would have loved to have gone back. Simply helping customers get their service installed or fixed was great, making sure everything was up and running before I left and the customer was pleased made my day."
good,"Responsible for handling internal support calls and resolving escalated customer problems/complaints promptly and efficiently.

Provide subject matter expertise for billing, products, process and procedures for all lines of business. Work in a group setting and with minimal supervisor support."

good,Good company to work for but very careful with the work life balance! Good benefits depending what your position is may be hard for advancement good group of people
good,"sell and help anyone who comes in the door"
good,"Great schedule, great team, great management, just great everything. I really wish it was hourly plus commission, because that's be PERFECT, but at the same time, being pure commission males you work harder than ANY hourly job."
good,"Comcast was a great company to work for with great benefits, moral boosters, bonuses,  my only issue was that I did not have the technical background needed for some of the more difficult calls I received.  Although the felt it was not needed for the job.  I felt  I was at a disadvantage because I did not have that skill set."
good,"This is a good company to work for if you are fresh to the industry or just want to change your career.  Training is paid and the culture is helpful.Technicians get to take their vehicles home nightly and start their days from home.  The work schedule is a 4 day 10 hour shift including one weekend day.The benefits are good, medical, dental, eye, 401k, sick leave, some paid holidays and a few personal days."
good,"Lots of changes being made constantly, must adapt and be flexible. Convenient vending machines with many options (although expensive). Basketball, Foosball, and gym available, but no ""resting"" or ""napping"" rooms."
good,Company is a solid from a financial aspect. They work with their employees and what to see them advance. As with any company all different management style.
good,"Recognized by management for providing superior customer service. Works closely with team and customers to produce positive results, resolved guest complaints. Meeting goals each month"
good,"Great company to work for. Very attractive benefits package."
good,Overall Comcast is a great place to work.  The benefits are wonderful and but the work enviroment van be stressful.  The most enjoyable part of the job is changing the customers perception of the company and the services that are offered.
good,"we would connect customers for their home security, cable, internet, and home phone services. Customer would send us new customers for being much more reliable than the people in the call centers"
good,get good training to take incoming calls from customers about the products and services. Learn the packages that are on sale for the time being. Supervisors are near by to help out if things get too tough or you can ask a coworker. the hard part of the job is dealing  with upset customers. the best part of the job is calming a customer down and making them happy.
good,"I am love the job and coworkers just have an issue with the long commute. Tons of learning opportunities, ie classes, Education assist programs."
good,Comcast is a strong company leading the industry in cutting edge technology. Its a great place to work with competitive wages and great benefits.

good,"Great customer service, worked well with others assisted if help was needed, focused on getting the situation cleared and understandable for the customer."
good,Great company to work for. My only reason for leaving was I relocated to another state. Other than that its a great company that offers opportunities to climb the ladder. They promote from within as well as hire outside.
good,"The only reason I had to leave was because they could not offer me a full time position, I loved my job and the people I worked with became my second family!"

good,comcast is a great company to work with it has a lot of room for advancement and great benefits. and the supervisors are very supportive and helpful.
good,"Having to change your schedule due to mandatory shift bids every six months, for people with young children this was difficult."
good,This is a fast paced and innovative work environment. As senior manager for environmental operations and configuration the days were filled with meeting multiple project needs and deliverables. I was able to utilize a team of 20 highly intelligent engineers across multiple platforms. The hardest part would be meeting conflicting deadlines for multiple organizations with different views on priority.
good,"Went to work at 10:00 AM and then we would start our morning meeting which usually consisted of some training or our daily goal. Leave the office to go to our assigned areas to knock door to door. Would start that process after lunch and usually be home by 6:00 PM. I learned confidence in myself and my abilities when it comes to the sales culture. I learned how to overcome objectives, and to not let them bring my attitude down. Management was awesome, I was always given the support and advice I needed to succeed in the company. My co-workers and I were very close, typically going to lunch together before starting to knock doors. The hardest part of the job, for myself, was in the beginning when I was learning how to overcome objections. The most enjoyable part of my job was the constant interaction with other people. I also loved being able to progressively become a better sales individual with the support of my team."
good,This was one of the cleanest call centers I've ever been in.  The management is easy to talk to.  The benefits were great.  Over all it was a great company to work for.
good,If you're good with your hands and posses the ability to retain information you can work at Comcast but along side of that you're people/customer service skills must be up to par. with Comcast there are a plethora of opportunities to move up with in the company as long as you have met whats required to apply and potentially land a new position.
good,Great place if you are a self motivated individual. have the flexibility to work your own hours within an assigned territory.
good,"I have only been working here for a week, but so far, so good! I wish the pay was better and the hours were more family friendly"

good,I enjoyed my job even the challenges. This was a fast pace workplace with frequent policy and procedural changes. The hardest part of my job being unable to resolve a customer issue remotely. The other challenges this position presented were angry customers who could become very verbally abusive. A special skill set was required  to calm and deescalate the call and build a good rapport.
good,"I understand that companies need to push sales in order to keep the business alive. However when pushing sales over shadows providing quality technical support there is a problem. They may have balanced this out since I was there as introducing sales was something new to the technical support side of operations. "

A typical day at work would include taking 50-80 calls to assist our customers with their bills and educate them on our products that were available to suit their needs. The hardest part of the job was being empathic while someone was calling you names. It was necessary for you to understand they were mad at the company not you. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with."

I enjoyed passing valuable knowledge to the agents because when I started there as an agent on the phones I didnt have this help.

good,"7.5 hours on telephone. Job was to retain customers, introduce them to all services. Explain the value of all services, and place them in a bundle that would save them money if they had all services with Comcast. I learned about sales, and learn good listening skills. Great co-workers, we worked as a team, and helped each other to reach goals. Hardest part of the job was not being able to interact face to face. Also, rules change constantly. We weren't given enough time to establish a good rapport with customers and tried to save the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving feed back of how great of a job I did. Customers would send letters of commendation, saying that I was an asset to the company, and that I really helped them, and how much they appreciated me taking the time and actual listening to them."
good,"the Delivery of Curriculum to all field technicians. Learned a lot about how to present information to employees. The Managers are all overwhelmed as well as all field technicians. too much work with not enough time to complete. the hardest part of the job is to complete all work in a timely manner, we were given short time frames. The most enjoyable part of the job was see the technicians be successful."

good,"typical day at work was  to take back to back calls and meet call center and personal goals."
good,My experience for comcast was the best. The Team Was Great When I Needed Help They Was There There Always On You About Certain Things They Just Want Better For You.
good,It can be stressful but it's rewarding ten fold. And you have so much support it does get repetitive even if a lot changes. And the wait for the next move in the company is a year but sometimes it feels like it takes for ever.
good,"You can be your own boss as you drive your own van. Also if you're good at your job you can be done at a reasonable time, if not you will be on overtime but thats always a good thing."
good,"I installed Cable all over the City. The job is pretty cool, there are supportive co workers and diverse and safe locations to do your job."
good,I enjoyed my time with Comcast this was the best job I had over my career. The culture the management team were awesome. The downside for me was the pay I felt as though we were underpaid atleast on the repair side and the schedule sucked it took me about 3 years to get a schedule good enough to be able to spend time with my family. Other then that the benefits were awesome and the family atmosphere was great. I would recommend anyone for Comcast they are a great employer
good,"The culture within in Comcast is laid back, and the benefits were amazing when it came to medica, dental, and vision. The hours are flexible, and change once a year. A lot of ways to work on your skills."
good,"High expectations, high reward.  Fantastic benefits, competitive salary, significant PTO. Challenge – frequent executive level change(restructuring). High turnover in the sales positions."
good,Comcast is a great place to have a career and work throughout the company for an extended period of time because there is so much to do within the company and continue to learn and grow.
good,"Buena experiencia en ventas"
good,Comast really takes care in their employees but this deffinatly isnt the job for everyone only about 40% of customer service reps trained stay through the first year .. its stressful and if your new you'll either be swing shift or working till midnight..
good,Relocating to a state without Comcast services is the only reason I’m leaving the company. Would have gladly transferred. Love the team and the benefits.
good,Loved my work and the team just didn’t like the hours and the stress when meeting our numbers safe environment great benefits great service and min pay for service
good,"it was fun, i didnt get payed, no one who volunteered got payed, but everyone was friendly and thats always a good thing. got to meet some cool people and be on the news"
good,"Started in sales before moving to Quality.  Was with company a year before move.  Supervisor and management very supportive with move.  With any entry level position sales was what I made of it, uncap commission was great."
good,I am currently employed at Comcast.  I love the support that I have had from my co worker thru out.  My co workers are helpful and was not afraid to share best practices.  No one was intimated by reaching for me and helping my learn the company.  I have enjoyed my short time with Comcast
good,"The Company prefers to promote from within ranks. They allow for college course and in company training programs."
good,"The manager is great to work for. He could have picked better supervisors with proficient leadership skills. You can always tell when they received new leadership training because they are terrible at implementing it. It’d be more comical if they weren’t your boss. The work is fine. Once you get the processes and learn to talk to customers, it becomes easy. The pay could be better, but with all the benefits, home garage, and cable services, it makes up the difference"
good,Good place to work. Great management team. On time help if you need it. Mangers have they back at all times...........................................
good,Great place to work. Company has a lot of opportunities for one to move up in the company. Great benefits and help provided to you. Company has great health benefits.
good,"As much as Comcast made you feel that your job was secured, it was nothing but. It is about the numbers. If you made your numbers, ie: Sales, 100% VOC's Then your job is secured until the following month. That is why it is a very stressful place to work at. When you questioned a rule, you were viewed as a trouble maker. No one could give you a straight answer - instead all supervisors and managers have the same scripted answers without even have a good understanding of what they were explaining. The pay was decent, Management tried to keep us happy by giving free food from time to time. We had game days. They brought in Masseurs to give us massages. Coloring books with color pencils to manage the stress of the day. Every month agents with good numbers for attendance, sales, VOC's receive an award. Trusting your co-working, in my opinion was not a good idea."
good,"Comcast, as a whole, works hard to deliver the best of technology to as many people as possible.   Culture is driven by doing the right thing and it often pushing new technologies into the market."
good,"I love Working for Comcast. I think it is a great place to work, my coworkers are friendly, my supervisor and management team, and co-workers make work fun. I love working from home."
good,"Was a really good expirience work with Comcast, the payment was really good for me, more than $60K bcs I worked for it, you have to focus on that and you can make it.. free complementary service and discount, bonuses and awards every quarter.. best place I ever work before .."
good,"Great company to work for, good benefits, great culture. very rich environment, friendly personal.fast-paced work environment, Great place to start a career in telecommunications."
good,"Had a great bunch of technicians, supervisors and Managers in the Fort Myers office. Employees are provided a lot of training. The benefits are pretty decent. I rarely found an issue with coworkers and supervisors. All around great place to work. "
good,"COMCAST is a great company to work for.  Many opportunities. The department I am in is very supportive of each other.  However, it is not a place to work if one does not like a fast paced changeable environment."
good,"I enjoyed the work. Family situation caused exit. Would go back in a second.  Fast paced, full of challenges.. Why is it that I need 150 characters. I thought it was good"
good,"Digital care department is a great place to work, they listen to employees feedback and we have great incentives. The schedules were very flexible including work from home."
good,"We worked ourselves out of a job :)"
good,We were always busy on the phone until the evening is when the call volumes dropped. I enjoyed my schedule working from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm but only Monday thru Friday.
good,"The environment is a bit odd. They company excels at many things. However there are moments when things don’t go as planned. Their response to such situation are a little backwards. It has great benefits and the service is great. Dealing with the systems can be frustrating on two fronts. Sometimes the customers want the impossible and instant gratification. This can be taxing as you never know when and how many of these people you will speak to in a given day. On the other hand you could have a scenario where the most sensible thing to do isn’t the jobs go to option. It’s a pain process to explain something like that to the customer.  Aside from those 2 elements it’s pretty picture perfect. Good Shifts, 2 breaks, Mandatory lunch and flexible OT"
good,"loved this job would go back if i could , loved my sup, had great employee benifits , great bonuses , and they did alot to show appreciation in the call center"
good,Comcast is a great place to work. The benefits are excellent along with providing the best technology and services the market has to offer. I would highly recommend them as an employer.
good,Overall comcast is a great company to work for. You can move around if you find a position that interest you and you are qualified for. I don't want to leave the company but I will due to relocation.
good,"Good pay and benefits. Production environment. Must make monthly goals. Can be stressful at times. Overall, if you can handle making daily goals then this is the place for you."
good,"There was a day of completeness, witch I loved kept me on my toes I learn to do my job will so I could move up the pay scales hardest part of my job not getting that first call solution taken care of joyable snacks rewards."
good,Great place to work and benefits are great People are wonderful. There is nothing you cant achieve if you put your mind to it and work hard . Comcast will give back in relationship to what you put in
good,You feel from day one you are a valued part of something great! From the graduation skits written by class to meeting sups and going out to lunch on the company to become acquainted.
good,I worked for Comcast cable and it was fun but very stressful at times.  I was able to advance at a steady pace and able to make very good money in less time than the new hires now make.
good,"Comcast was very good at training people and re purposing employees.  I started out as a Customer Service Representative and was able to move up into a higher role.  Comcast valued their employees, was supportive of all types of people, it was very diverse, had many different little things to make employees happy, including company outings, free chair massage, different types of breaks and treats.  The list does not end.  The pay was also very fair.  I would work there again but unfortunately Cable is what the main product is in my area and people are cutting the cord on cable.  Comcast has more opportunities in their main headquarters office in Philadelphia."
good,"Installations of internet phone and tv for business customers from small to large business covering every field imaginable. Also responding to customer requests and service calls, troubleshooting all services such as internet connectivity and call quality issues."
good,"visiting clients in Central and west Florida, competition present in every corner, low customer loyalty, limited growth in the market, job eliminated along time."
good,"Nice company & benefits. Could be more flexible with hours and incentives.  Nice co workers. Management needs more communication with the employees and Supervisors. Everyone is friendly and helpful. More training is needed, hands on."
good,Comcast is a good place to work.  They have good benefits but pay could be a bit higher.  They are also adding more to their benefits all the time!!!!
good,"I enjoyed the competitive atmosphere at Comcast. It was a great place to work. They often provided lunches, discounts & perks to all of the employees."
good,"Comcast is a great place to work , you can transfer and do anything in this company. They have an open door policy so you can rest assured that any concerns you have you can address them."

good,"Meeting and selling and growing comcast bussiness, i learn how to befriend customers that didnt really like comcast, to like me in order to hear  the benefits comcast has to offer."
good,I truely believed the main focus of the company was money. The fact that it was also required to get 20 sales a day was horrible. The customers are calling because things don't work and I have to sell them something.
good,"Management styles and pay scales were great.  Mentoring was also beneficial.Employees depend on each other for departmental success.  Managers are sometimes inexperienced, but are always seeking better ways to be coached."
good,"Being a Technician was very fun especially if you are sociable. Being able to go into customers homes and install equipment was always fun. You see something new everyday, whether its good or bad, you still see it lol. I really enjoyed being at this company, besides climbing up 20ft on utility poles."
good,"great work enviroment , everyday there was an new issue to address and support , always plenty of focus on security of the customers personal information"
good,Keeps current with technology and provides opportunity for growth and career development.  Encourages keeping resume and job skills current and available for internal employers.  Currently downsizing positions which impacts me
good,Good place to work.  Environment was good. People were very helpful. Lunches were always great. Pizza stand is the best. Working inside the braves stadium is the best part.
good,"a typical day is fast paced with about no time to 1 min between calls. Services and job requirements and duties change regularly. most enjoyable part of my job is helping the elderly when they call in with questions, concerns or issue's with their services."
good,"Comcast is a very good company to work for.  Comcast also has some amazing benefits. You get paid time off, vacation time, sick time, and the house that you work are really great."
good,I absolutely loved working at Comcast it was the best job I think I have ever had. The managers are amazing and the staff are amazing as well. It felt really nice to be able to help and calm down the customers and to just talk to them.
good,"I liked working at Comcast because it was a fun place to work.  Comcast offered advancement opportunities and with good benefits.  Comcast offered excellent perks for employees, such as discounted service and health-wellness."
good,"its cool just not the salary wise. we get 8 sicks day and 10 vacation days and 3 floating holidays days. they match our 401k , and also they give us discounted cable"
good,On a day to day basis I would get on the phones and take inbound/outbound calls to collect on past due accounts. The hardest part of the job is the constant negativity bashing from the customers. The managers are really great and supervisors really help coach to dealing with that.
good,"great place to work but be prepared for some challenging days, but for the most part days are consistent and very fun depending on supervisor, Great place to hone you person to person skills"
good,"I love working for Comcast.  The benefits are amazing.  I wish the pay was slightly more to match cost of living increases, but the other benefits are worth it.  They provide an extensive amount of discounts including product discounts. For example through Verizon, Apple etc. also you can receive discounts for park visits to Universal Studios. They pride themselves on work/life balance in the executive space and offer a great paid time off incentive too."
good,Working at Comcast afforded me the opportunity to learn different elements of the business. I was promoted from a customer account executive to a Sr. Retail Representative
good,"take calls"
good,I enjoyed the freedom of the job.  The ability to work without constantly having a supervisor standing over you.  However the daily output expectation didnt allow you to pay the customer the attention they deserve
good,it is stressful and cut thoat and fun at the same time.  they tell you one thing and do another  the benfits are nice however you only getting a discount not paid in full benfits
good,Working at Comcast has been a great and useful experience. I am always challenged with new responsibilities and duties to keep me going throughout the day.
good,"I had the potential to write my own check.  The processes and communication was lacking at times.  There is an ""Atlas Shrugged"" "
good,"I enjoyed working at Comcast. I was a customer service representative answering phones.  I also worked in the cable stores, which I enjoyed more, since I was able to got the hands on experience with the cable equipment."
good,"Typical day a work is being assigned a job, calling the customer before getting there. once I arrived I make contact with the customer about the problem."
good,"I made over $52,000 my last yer there after there for 3 years. The pay is okay but the bonus is what makes the job worth it. base pay starts around $14 something, but with bonus you can add $1200-$2000 on your check each month. You also get free Comcast services in home. Great benefits, but know, you will likely hate this job b/c of the ppl you talk to on the phone. But you will stay b/c of the great benefits and pay, and trips and prizes and free services. "
good,was a great place to work. Managment was awesome. People were friendly you recieved all the training you needed to do the job before you hit the floor.
good,The most fun I ever had at any job I ever worked. It was great fixing customers issues and getting that instant gratification after completing a job for a customer.

good,"This job was amazing yet stressful. The pay was very competitive, i was sad to see the department shut down after major changes to the company.  I would have loved to continue working there"
good,Company was very good at supporting Customer Service Employees. All employees helped each other out in dealing with unhappy customers. Training was excellent.
good,Pay for schooling that can be used within the company. Meet all kinds of people. Lots of ways to make some more money. As a tech you have to know people and get your name out there to advance. I got bypasses for many jobs with out so much as a phone interview. Getting my name out there is very difficult as a tech. I have to use pto to make all the company events
good,"retired after 25 years"
good,It was okay the pay was great and the benefits. I liked the people that i worked with. Comcast is not bad if you can meet your numbers. Very high call volumes at times
good,"Comcast laid off hundreds of sales people, including myself.  It had nothing to do with job performance.  It was elimination of the position with a new plan of approach decided by corporate management.  It was completely unexpected and devastating.  I truly loved my job and the product I represented."
good,Great place to work and very employee centric.  They value their employees with excellent company benefits including 401k match from day one as well as a stock purchasing plan
good,"Fast pace and fun environment with as much support as you need. You get paid what you are worth. If you're lazy you may get by, but if you work you get well compensated. Wish I was still there."
good,"I loved this job and was really good at it, until I was moved to a new sup in a mandatory shift bid and it all went down from there. With the exception of that one supervisor I have nothing but good things to say about Comcast as an employer."
good,"comcast is a large company departmentalized for efficiency."
good,This job has been one of the best jobs I have ever had. My managers was amazing and the incentives the company has put into place to encourage us to sell more were very encouraging.
good,"Comcast is a great place to work, the pay is great, you have the opportunity to make a lot of money because we work off of commission Great benefits for yourself and family as well!"
good,For the most part your day is planned out for you with the curve ball here and there.  You must be self motivated and quick to problem solve.  Everyone is always will to help with information or with manual labor.
good,"I love working with people, meeting their needs and making sure they have what is needed to be successful in life. "
good,"Typically mornings were for emails, follow ups, and setting new appointments. I would run appointments in the afternoon, meeting with business owners and IT Directors. My telecom vendors loved the Comcast Fiber product and were able to support me substantially."
good,"Comcast is a terrific company with very good people and products.  They have an incredible set of resources for training and mentoring employees.  The culture is generally very positive, but are also stuck in the mode of old world thinking - which is challenging in today's media landscape."
good,"Comcast is a great company to work for.  i enjoyed my time there and left only due to a better opportunity,  It's fast-paced with good pay and commission opportunities."
good,It was a great place to work and they definitely treated the employees fairly. All of the managers were always willing to help no matter what the issue might have been. Very comfortable environment.
good,"What I did on a day to day basis to train my team to be more knowledgeable about Comcast has to offer about there products. What I have learned that to be successful you have to work hard to get where you need to be and when you have a strong team behind you, take them to the top with you."
good,I loved everything about Comcast. The only downfall was I worked the 3-12midnight shift and i lived almost an hour away. I've had 2 accidents one in which it caused me to break a leg
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my time working at here. I was able to utilize my skills to learn a new industry and brand. This will be helpful in my overall career path."
good,"Comcast was a fun place to work at, was able to meet many different people from different cultures."
good,Supervisors are awesome they kinda let you do your own thing most of the time. Most days you are not overloaded with work and Comcast trains you well enough to do day to day tasks
good,Comcast was a great working experience. Lots of intelligent and capable people working in various capacities to get the jobs done. The company stresses production but has the man power to back it up.
good,"I enjoyed working with comcast. They are involved in the community. they offer many services to the less fortunate, they have a very diverse working company. They a;so offer tuition reimbursement"

good,"The Company pays based on the provincial rate and grave yard shift, provides trainings and cross trainings."
good,"Management really seemed to care about their employees and the company did implement a lot of changes employees asked for.  The benefits were as good as anywhere I have worked. "
good,Comcast is a very good company to work for if you are good with handling stress. It is very important to arrive on your shift on time also to remain focused.
good,"Opportunity to make Great pay, well cominsated during training, free cable and discounted services, lots of employee activities, lots of incentives, multiple shifts to choose from, very informative and thorough training to set you up for success. Opportunity for advancement and or transfers to other departments"
good,Good place to work if you dont have a family and just want to work all the time. Good pay and good team working. Mmanditory OVERTIME happened A LOT but the pay was worth it
good,A typical day at work consists of training the content for Comcast University to new and incumbent technicians.  The workplace culture is one of inclusion and respect.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when a participant has a moment of understanding with a topic that they may have struggled with in the past.
good,"This was a great company to work for overall, the employer took care of the employee but you did have to work hard and be willing to go the extra mile overall"
good,fast paced work day with time crunches to maintain but long as you follow the standard of the work to be done you will have a supervisor free experience and with no micromanagement.
good,"It was call center work, so it was inherently stressful. The people you work with make the job enjoyable. The management staff were employee-centric and were constantly trying to do what was best for the team."
good,"Siendo tecnico de Comast me ha ayudado mucho con mi desarrollo linguistico y profesionalmente he crecido, he aprendido a desarrollar habilidades para el mejoramiento de mi trabajo y a darle una mejor imagen a la compañía con la satisfacción del cliente al tener su servicio al 100% trabajando"
good,Great people to work with and learn from but hard to advance within local area. Training needs to be improve in all areas. Benefits are wonderful and offer other benefits for family.
good,"Outbound sales is very hard and stressful. Potential customers cuss at you, hang up on you, threaten you. The goals are high for 4 to 5 hrs a day. As a college kid, I wouldn't recommend this job due to the stress put on you to meet you numbers."
good,"The job was challenging due to working with difficult customers daily but I learned to adapt to it. We had our on cubicles that we were allowed to decorate and fun games happening on breaks. There were also a lot of perks, including free cable!"
good,The company has been on an evolutionary path for the past 10 years from been a Cable to a Technology company. Now the company is a net producer of technology that drives its product lines.
good,Great People and a great work place. Love the new building. Management is easily approachable and loves to help. Very competitive with a good team environment.
good,Great place with great pay and benefits.  The downfall is always changing to where you have to re-apply for what you have already been doing for over 5 years
good,Comcast you drive around and try your best to fix customers issues.  Alot of the time the customers create their own issues and its your job to fix what they screwed up.
good,Comcast in general is a great company to work for. As a sales rep it does make it a bit challenging because they are the only company around here and not liked.
good,"A typical day at work for me was something to look forward to, never complained. Learned a lot about customer service and how to take care of the customers."
good,"Fun place to work, depending on what division you work for. I enjoy the Spotlight side which is advertising. Can be stressful sometimes, but benefits are good and the people I work with are friendly"
good,"Its a hard job but the faculty will take care of you. plus u gain a salary and if u make sales u make commission. Faculty, of supervisors will assist along your way. they want you to be successful."
good,"Great Benefits. Great atmosphere. Great hourly pay. Extra perks. I performed a service route daily, installing tv, internet, phone and home security.."
good,I enjoyed my job.We Had a revolving door with managers that affected our department greatly.They were not in the security business before we were hired. we had a very difficult time trying to help them to understand the type of product they we now selling. it definitely was a true work in progress.
good,This is a great place to work just gets exhausting after a while. I have worked here for 5 years and just now starting to get burnt out on the work I am doing.
good,Theres nothing like working and looking forward to walking in the workplace. I am (as of now) in school to be a medical assistant but willing to work full time in a customer oriented environment. I work well with othersbut most of all I get the job done. I put forth the best effort in all work. If my face/name's attached theyll come back!!!!
good,"Comcast was a great place to work. Management was approachable and genuine. Located above Suburban Station, commuting was easy in bad weather and there are plenty of food options. The view from the cafe can't be beat, which can help on a stressful day."
good,I loved working at Comcast. Time was giving off the phones for training and time to talk to your boss. I worked in the call center for almost two years. Comcast has amazing incentives and really good commission.
good,"Check mail, complete walk through, adjust temp to building, replaced light bulbs and minor electrical work, plumbing, moving furniture etc..."
good,Fun place with a light atmosphere. Was allowed to step outside my role many times and expand creatively to build my resume and become a more well rounded professional.
good,"Arrived at customer home,, greet customers build a rapport about conerning issues.  I love interacting with people and glad I'm there to assist with there problems."
good,Working at Comcast is great regardless of what anyone has to say. We receive great benefits and have a very good work/life balance. They offer team building events as well as one heck of a holiday party.
good,"I enjoy the meeting new people everyday.  Each day was an adventure.  People relied on us as professionals to suite and fulfill their expectations.  And we, the technicians know that and we produced it.  It's unfortunate some ot the tech supervisors have individual knowledge about people skills, sometimes make it hard for the techs to do their job.  They believe that pressure and stress are what motivate employees to work.  Regardless, I managed to work there for 10 years.  I must say, the senior management is great.  I have no complaint about them."
good,"Once trained, you're given the freedom to do jobs on your own. Pay is decent, and the benefits are better. Free TV/internet/home security, just pay for the equipment rental"
good,my experience with comcast is full of ups & downs. for the most part it was a fun place to be and work. I happily participated in OT & people were really friendly... When i tried to advance my career within Comcast is where i always ran into issues... i wanted to explorer a more technical route & experienced road blocks transitioning from the sales call center
good,"Good company, but looking for a job with more growth.I like IT and want a job in that field .Comcast is good but I don't like the extreme cold and heat that I have to work in ."
good,"I worked at Comcast for just short of a year. I absolutely loved it. The hours were a bit hectic and it definitely meant I had to plan around my lifestyle. Yet at the same time having the freedom to start and stop as you please was amazing. You just have to keep in mind the more you work the more money you make. The incentives and commission for this job is absolutely incredible. The more effort you put into it you can expect a return tenfold. "
good,"I have enjoyed my tenure with Comcast, and now am looking to move out of state to further my growth.   the work is very rewarding to help business owners to brand their inventory.  I have awesome co-workers, each of them are very dedicated to what they do for Comcast."
good,"A typical day centered on a focused effort to gain acceptance and buy-ion for project initiatives, timing and conflict avoidance."
good,Great Place to work and good benefits. Life balance a little off due to the amount of work. Benefits are one of the best that can be offered. Advancement opportunities not that good.
good,"Comcast is a wonderful company to work for. The benefits and pay is exceptional. Work life balance can be frustrating at times. If you do not have the patience to deal with customers, sometimes very angry customers, do not apply for this company."
good,Our company works as a team to make sure each and every customer are getting the best value for their dollar. Working for Comcast has been a really great experience. The most enjoyable part about is making sure the customers are hundred percent satisfied.
good,"My day at work would typically start with an employee meeting at Comcast before heading out to the field to knock doors and sale. I learned how to communicate with people from different backgrounds. The hardest part of my job was being out in the Houston summer heat for eight hours a day. The most enjoyable part of my job had to be talking to the many people about life, goals and beliefs."
good,I love working for Comcast! I find a lot of joy in fixing things and I do it every day. I also like that i do not have to pay for another vehicle because when I work Comcast provides me a vehicle to drive home every day! they also have very very good benefits

good,"I've been able to flourish in the technical world. Grew more proficient with Microsoft programs along with any technical troubleshooting and solutions dealing with computers and products. "
good,"A typical day of work is calling customers to try and reschedule tech appointments.  Management is super, cares for employees.  Good mix of coworkers, old, young, mixed ethnicities, Men and women.   The most difficult part of job is always calling customers let them know techs will not show up for scheduled appointment, cad try to schedule another appt.  Management, co-workers, and the care the company takes of employees."
good,"I learned a lot from the company,i felt really great helping the customers with there issues.My co-workers where great people,helped me learn a lot and the hard part for me was when i wansn't able to help a customer with there issues until i try to help them get it solved."
good,"Was a great place to work, worked well with management and co-workers. Hardest part of job was moving paper work through finance department."
good,"a company that you can grow starting for a entry leve to the sky is the limit. "

Co-workers sometimes a little tricky, but that is why we are all different. If we were all the same it would get pretty boring. The worst thing about it was that you were held to a metrix that you had to meet each month or you would have a ""coaching moment"" but overall, i really liked it."

I learned so much about how to effectively proceed through the Sales process and to strive to secure the results, renewals and referrals for my clients. The most enjoyable part of both selling and leading a team is the industry itself. The Cable TV industry is ever changing and was always looking forward never backwards.

I also was able to plan and schedule my own day my manager was located at another location. I enjoyed working with my sales team.

If my position was still available I would still work there today."
good,Expectations to do your job as well as your peers and continually gives you different kinds of work without paying you what you should be paid. Good and bad experiences with management though currently its only been an improvement. Great benefits but poor pay.

The company is growing and strengthening its approach to new ideas to streamline the repair of issues and provide the best possible experience, but like all growth there is sometimes a rift in process. Communication is key but like any new processes the rifts are being addressed and the processes worked on, patience is key as things cant change overnight.

I look at emails and review my goals and quotas then have a little huddle with the team to get us fired up. After that is when the magic starts customers start coming in and they receive a warm welcome I look into accounts let them know about all lines of business we offer. Not just blindly pitching it but tactfully placing these programs into their lives. After that quickly review with managers on productivity and what to work on. It’s not always about sales almost 80 percent is problem solving and billing but always incorporate our services in there to also fix it
good,Its was a regular 9-5 It's a sales plus commission job tou get out what you put into it. however my management and my team where awsome it made going to work everyday fun.

good,"In the customer care department, its fairly fast-paced, but the employees and company truly want to do what's best for the core business and customers. The culture is very inclusive and with the frontline having such difficult roles, its a constant balancing act between keeping their morale high while ensuring metrics are met."
good,There is more focus on sales in my particular position. Of course this is one way for the company to increase revenues. Attendance is heavily monitored.
good,"Busy, Fun, and Diverse. Customer interactions can be challenging, but the true satisfaction comes from their smiles at the end. Customer Satisfaction is a strong goal."

good,Each day would start off by going into the office to check your accounts.The most enjoyable part of the job was giving events at the properties we managed.
good,"Comcast was a great place to work with excellent benefits ."
good,"Great place to work; however, job security is based on montly performace goals. Some of the metrics are based on metrics outside of our conrol as agents. An example is first call resolution within one week. A customer calls back due to a technician not showing up. The 80 percent metic can be easily missed due to reasons outside our control."
good,Great company with great benefits but it has become to PC over the last couple of years. We cant even put up a Christmas tree or play Christmas music. We also need to be closed on more holidays

good,I enjoyed my time at Comcast. There was a lot of growth that I was able to take advantage of. I would probably been there longer if the lay offs would not have taken place.
good,"I was contracted to work for Comcast.  I loved what I did, loved working there, and wanted to stay on full-time, however, they were not hiring on at the time my contract was up.  I went with a different company instead of staying on for another year as a contractor as I because FTE at this company."
good,"flexible hrs, great culture.     Management is great.   take care of their employees.     everyone worked together, helped each other out to get the work completed"
good,Was hired to take on the responsibility of re-designing their ITSM Configuration Management Database. This involved reversing much of the work implemented by a previous integrator.
good,"Comcast is a great place to work. I love the financial stability and benefits."
good,Customers call to see if they can be set up cable and internet or to upgrade their current services or try to up sale customers on getting a security system.
good,"Cool place to work, great people, benefits and salary. Love my team and co-workers. Comcast is great place to work. Don't have any regrets. Love my job."
good,"Fast paced environment with high stress potential, but great benefits and energetic CEO with growth motivation for the organization. Lots of opportunities to grow your career and more so if you are willing to relocate and travel."
good,My co workers were welcoming and made me feel right at home. My responsibility was Bill payments and equipment but they made me feel important. I wish I could have stayed and it was through the company.
good,"I loved working for Comcast I hate that they laid us off but I would work that company anytime they call me back. The benefits are the best that I have seen. Free Cable,home phone,internet and home security. The 401k is dollar for dollar match and all the other perks are just great. I can not say anything bad about this company."
good,Overall Great benefits and great place to work. However just never get comfortable and always be prepared for change.  Absorb as much knowledge as possible do what works for you. Try it and if it doesn’t work try what you think works for you.
good,"Comcast is a great company to work for, they offer advancement classes within the company to help you get more certifications that help you advance your position with the company."
good,"I was a DSR in Philadelphia for 3 years with the best pay structure any company can offer. When the company layed off everyone, it was the worst thing that happened to some of us. But, mostly we all turned that experience into a positive now. However, what I noticed is that Comcast offers the best of everything to their employees, which made it feel like home. Honesty there's so many people that will agree that some of the reasons the reps get discouraged is due to poor management that is one of the biggest issues Comcast oversee when their employees are not doing well they are overlooked because the District manager is  close friends with the sales manager so they team up to sabotage their reps. Not a good look. But, overall the company was great and so was the money."
good,"I was one of the developers of the Desktop Design team. I created the scope of work, policy & procedures and training materials. The Desktop Design team overseen the presale fiber design surveys, post sales, hyperbuilds and special projects. The desktop design team was created without manager or director influence. This was a self taught and development by myself and fellow coworker. Working with the design teams, construction and sales teams was a great experience. The only downfall about this position is when the director put a new manager to oversee the team with zero experience in the fiber design field. Contractors are overseen of their abilities, what they have created and developed. Internal managers have thrived on taking the credit for the contractors success. With that being said, it was a great working experience with what i have helped develop and the accomplishments that i have made."
good,My co-workers were all like family to me. In this office including techs and managers were about 22 people in all. That's why it felt like family. Hours were 8-5
good,I thoroughly enjoy working at Comcast and have grown my career exponentially since becoming employed as a contractor in 2015.  The company is constantly growing and changing and is an exciting place to work.
good,"Great employer, good work environment, company expectations were high, advancement possible. Travel was required for my position. Hardest part of job was trying to balance work/home life.  Best part of the job was the ability to advance with company."
good,One of the most challenging places I ever worked at. Great learning experience. Meet some really good people there. I thanked them for showing me what am capable of.
good,"Overall Good Company, Good benefits, some opportunities to move up, Great job culture, Management help as much as they can, most enjoyable part no one is constantly standing over you, Just could use a pay increase due to cost of living"

good,"Great Place to Work, Wonderful Benefits, Discounts, and working environment. Team work atmosphere with advancements available,  All around great place."
good,Company is a great company to work for IF you are full time. Part time pay isn't worth it until you live right down the street from the company and plan to make a couple of sells a day.
good,"I would recommend Comcast to anyone. It is a great opportunity to work for a company of this caliber. The pay is awesome, and the employee's are great."
good,"Comcast Cable hands downs one of the best corporate companies that I have been apart of. Besides getting free cable and internet which is an awesome perk, i have been able to position myself to learn about the entire network, multi-levels of customer service, and how the corporate structure feeds the entire state and international business medium.  Definitely learned a lot that I can apply to future business proceedings."
good,Job is great because of the people you work with. There is many options to go through. The culture is diverse and very welcoming very nice warm and friendly.
good,"I worked in both NY and LA offices and loved my time at both.  All of my managers were caring people who were invested in both my personal development and professional success.  "
good,"Unfortunately, I was let go before the move to the shiny new building in Doral, but it was a great place to work before that. So, I'm guessing it is still a great place to work."
good,"my day consist of logging on a bridge call daily, at start of day running spreadsheet and transferring data on an excel document of daily productivity and manpower for the day. Communicating verbally, via email or chat. gathering written correspondence for management to communicate with customers to handle customer escalations, ensuring the customer experience is a great one. We had daily metrics to meet. fast paced environment must have the ability to multi tasked in a fast paced environment."
good,I would daily go door to door in my assigned territory trying sign up new or upgrade current customers. We were paid extremely well for our work. Great training and excellent benifits.

good,"a great way to be responsible for providing customer support by actively listening to each customer. Provide resources including contact numbers links, and support information for situations such as"
good,Typical day would be getting to know people in certain neighborhoods. The best way to do that is to walk around and talk. I learned a lot about sale strategies and overcoming objections. Knowing that each person is different is a great way to understanding the wants and needs of the customer. I loved the job just because of the people I was with on a team. Management always treated us like we were the backbone of the company.
good,"Our group works in the most competitive media market in the U.S.  But instead of a very cutthroat atmosphere, everyone looked out for each other.  It starts at the top of New York's leadership and filtered down through the team.  A great place to work and highly discounted TV/phone/internet service if you reside in a Comcast town."
good,Currently making better changes however I feel like the pay should be more as a base rate. They do have curtesy services for current employees they match your 401k and they discount stock if you purchase
good,Great training for any kind of Customer Service work. Collections is hard work but I was successful in it and enjoyed the challenges and achieves successful results for the company and compensation.
good,"Comcast was a good place to work, Comcast had job security to all their employees, but it was not room for advancement. So I left to complete my degree at Michigan State University."
good,I love working at Comcast and it has afforded me the opportunity to take care of my family. At the same time I feel like the work that I do is important.
good,The company makes an effort to provide for work life balance.  There are many surveys and reviews of surveys that focus on employees and their satisfaction with Comcast and its leaders.
good,"I would say as long as you have think skin, and you are willing to work outside in any whether, this is a good move to make. The job pay extremely well, with a base salary with uncapped commissions. Sales jobs are stressful and it does consume your time. You have to be dedicated. I had a recent loss in my family, and it was too stressful for me. But I would give it another shot if opportunity came up again. In Portland,the sales management team is the best, very concerned about you as a person, not just your performance. A great place to work at, especially if it is a entry level position for you."
good,I answered phone calls from Customers and solved their issue.. I explained their bill and how to understand it. I explained the technology and how to use it..
good,"A typical day at work was Organized and organized"
good,"I loved working for Comcast, the culture was amazing, and any issue you may have can be addressed. They care about their employees however there is no room for growth."
good,Professional fun environment. First hand experience at corporate america. Much collaborative work and meeting new people. Worked on two projects through team work.
good,"I've worked for this company for 12 years, in many different departments and I worked hard while working in them. Unfortunately large corporations decisions are made that you locally have no control over.. The culture here is one that I've never seen and love thriving in. Friendly people who help when they can, and that you can learn a lot from. I truly love working for this company. There is a lot of room for improvement on all sides frontline, management and  but there are definite losses in communication.  I love working here and I hope to come back into a culture like this but time will definitely tell. "
good,Comcast is a great place to work. Compensation is fair and management is collaborative. Only negative is there is little room to advance your career because there is little attrition in senior management positions.
good,We worked as a team even though most of our efforts were individual. walking door to door provided many opportunities to meet and talk with a wide range of personalities.
good,"I just didn't like the hours, you were required to work on weekends which is not why I signed up. I enjoyed meeting different people. I learned about different patterns. Work place culture to relaxed. I enjoyed the paycheck."

good,I have a great relationship with management. They are very adamant about giving everyone an opportunity for advancement and skill development. The benefits are great!
good,Comcast is a good place to work but it is very stressful. The management is greedy and inconsistent when it comes to pricing and customer accounts. Very good products.
good,"We were on the phone for 8 hours a day. Learning all the codes and once you got them down, they changed them. Their was a lot of different things we dealt with, TV -  movies, HBO//Showtime, internet service and digital phone.  My department had different shifts and we were open seven days a week. Had two days off in a row. Was laid off from sales support,  due to the department was went away. The hardest part was trying to not snack all day long."
good,"This company was by far the best place I have ever worked for. Excellent benefits, tuition reimbursement, pay ( I could go on for days), is very hard to beat. You are treated like family and a the environment is safe. If you are looking for long term, Comcast is definitely the place to be."
good,"I looked forward to going to work each day. I was in a work environment where I was constantly rewarded for productivity and achievement. Our workplace culture was very family oriented, and going the extra mile became the norm."
good,"great place to word, good work culture, they always helpful and willing to work with employees. I enjoyed my time at the company and have learned a lot in customer service."
good,"upon arrival to work check equipment inventory. Check up on jobs and installations. Spend some time to rout and schedule my day, coordinate with a possible work partner. Grab some lunch with coworkers. Then go out to the turf to gain and up sell customers. Working in cable an entertainment you learn a lot about people and there subjects of value. Most of the management was pretty great. As well as most of the employees. The hardest part of the job was the endurance and adjusting to the many types strategy's and techniques"
good,"I did enjoy my time at Comcast.  They offer great benefits especially if you live in a Comcast service area you pay next to nothing for you services.  Comcast does give you a lot of perks like discounts for buying things and all kind of free stuff from work such as coffee mugs, t-shirts, etc."
good,if you can make the numbers its a great company to work for.  the pay and benefits are great if you can reach given goals.  better the numbers the less the stress.
good,"The benefits associated with working for that establishment were excessive. The loyalty to the employees benefited everyone involved including the company.  The workload was stressful at times dealing with the customer base that were not always pleasant, but everything seemed worth it.  Extra incentives were available for those that wished to."
good,"Company downsized and resulted in layoffs in the department I worked in."
good,"I got laid off, but it was the best and easiest job I had. Friendly coworkers and managers. Flexible hours, discounted service, and great benefits plus pay."
good,If you can get in do it remember that everyone starts somewhere but there is an opportunity for advancement. There is a lot of training and you must be able to maintain your schedule to show up when you're expected. Tardiness will not be tolerated.
good,"This is a top notch job to get yourself started towards something greater. There is a really good culture of appreciation for the employees. If you interview well enough, you could start right out of high school, but it takes a long time to master all of the skills necessary for this job."
good,Reorgs are frequent and priorities tend to shift but they are they generally moving in the right direction in order to keep up with competition.  The shift to improved customer experience is a positive all around.
good,I really enjoyed working for Comcast the incentive program was awesome.  I have won several trips that were compensated by the company for my work performance.  We had a culture in the workplace that identified you as an individual and as a Team..
good,I started off doing inbound calls for customers then I moved on to outbound calling for Comcast inbound was way easier. Outbound was calling to receive a payment from one of the customers.
good,"I loved working here, my supervisor was awesome. If you enjoy telesales, this is the job for you! This is a GREAT COMPANY OVERALL, but very competitive environment."
good,Had huge success with Comcast and built a large portfolio of customers and referrals. Company under went a restructure plan that caused me to lose most of my business and income. I had to other choice but to either accept a severance package or accept the new pay scale.
good,"Very strong company with ambitious product goals, so there are always many projects to work on. Finance dominates all, including most decision making. Many layers of management at various organizational levels: corporate, division, region - which bogs down the decision-making process. Company holds high standards for customer experience (yes, they do!) and invests much in employee training and development."
good,Great company. Worked a lot of late nights. That can be hard for a family. Management was very helpful. Great benefits. Culture can sometimes be a challenge especially with any change.
good,Great company to work for and great benefits. The job contradicts itself when it comes to what you are supposed to do versus what you have to do to survive
good,"Excellent place to work, great benefits, good environment. Tough to advance with out degree but Comcast provides tuition reimbursement to assist you with completing your education."
good,"My day is filled with customers calling the Corporate office.  I would assist with providing credits and restoring service; however, I would often need to create an escalated ticket to have a regional corporate supervisor resolve an issue for them."
good,A hunter's role with loads of benefits. The commission structure is great. The training is top notch. With the implementation of Salesforce it has made the job a lot more efficient.
good,"In the service center, typically easy day. The company needs to work on managers, a lot of favoritism. Most of your peers on the same level as you, keep a family atmosphere."
good,"-We have monthly goals that seemed unreachable "
good,I love being able to get into the field and talk with our customers and help with any problem they may have.  I also love the joy I  bring when I save an account.

good,Comcast was a great place to work. I enjoyed my job immensely. The only problem I had was that is it not for a mom. The direct sales position was very demanding and I needed to be out selling while my kids were home. What this meant was that I rarely saw them. Ilook forward to working there again when my kids are grown!
good,Working for this section was a very great experience and be ready for changes everyday.   The workflow is up and down.   You have your busy days and you  have some slow days.  The atmosphere is friendly and enjoyable.   Who have to learn to get along with others and i have learned a lot about the Workforce side of the business.
good,Comcast teaches you how to deal with different types of customer in different situations. I appreciate the knowledge and kills I've gained along with the benefits and stability.

good,Was a very good place to work.  Provided excellent training.  Loved the people I worked with and the problem solving.  Hardest part of the job is it could be stessfull at times.  Management was excellent and always willing to help you get the training needed to advance in your position with the company.
good,Great place to work with excellent benefits. Perfect balance of work and personal life. The perfect are unbeatable and adds extra value to your employment.

good,"This company is great. I worked there for about 7 years and enjoyed the challenge of maintaining company goals. The supervisors and managers were awesome. Training, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The culture of the work -place was comfortable.  Great team work!"
good,Xfinity was good. It gives you the chance to learn all about the Xfinity products. The 14 hours a day they give are great for some people as well. They're set up was bad however. Reason I say that is because as a new person they had a specialist check after the employee work however they didn't have a specialist check the work to see what was really needed of that customer.
good,I was employed here for under a year. The pay and benefits are great but the work itself is stressful. I worked in the phone/internet department. I was responsible for troubleshooting internet and phone service for customer.
good,Fast paced and rewarding work days. Learned how to be in a more leadership based role. Some form of management is always available. Co-workers are very supportive and work well as a team. The hardest thing about working for this company is hearing the public speak so negatively about them. The most enjoyable part of this company is knowing we have superior products.
good,"Was a field rep responsible for, generating new and return business, working with clients through installation and continuation of client care."

good,Great company to work for. The balance of working and still having time off worked out great. They really listen to their employees. Co-workers get along and are always willing to help each other.
good,"Comcast was a great company to work for, management and supervisors all care for every employee, they talk and treat all employees equally and with so much respect, possibly the best compnany i have worked for."
good,"The hours for door to door salesman are very long. I'm not a good salesman because I'm not a big TV watcher. I prefer to be outside, that is the big plus to being door to door, you get to be outside all day, rain or shine."
good,meetings from 9:00-10:00. Then drive around to my communities and meet with property managers and make sure everyone is satisfied with our services. Also run events in communities to invite everyone out and get to know our customers. I've learned how to deal with unsatisfied customers and turn them into loyal customers.
good,Life with Comcast was a learning experience. Went through many changes over the years and adaped.I enjoyed fulfilling needs and interacting  with my coworkers and vendors throughout my systems.
good,Excellent products and way above competition and a drive to improve the customer contact. Comcast will dominate industry and they push for achievement each and every day.
good,love the opportunities given to employees. A lot of vacation time is provided for employee. Benefits are amazing including the payment & commission plan.
good,I think the besides job security and pay I think that this station is an excellent place to work. I say job security is not the best because twice in the last three years I've either had my hours cut down or I was forced to take a 3 month hiatus.
good,"I really enjoy working for comcast as a whole. The company really strives to share with its employees, making everyone personally feel like we are owners in the workplace."
good,"i gave them a 5 star overall and 1 star for management i always looked forward into selling because of the incentive you get at the end of the month. they are always giving away things, gift cards, tickets, and etc to motivate you into selling. i always made sure i came out on top"
good,"typical day at Comcast is being on the phones dealing with customer concerns and finding a resolution that meets both needs of the customer and company. the management is very involved with there team and the co-workers always there for each other. the hardest part of the job is the constant negativity of the calls it is retention and most of the time dealing with an issue that customers have struggled with and want to cancel services. the most rewarding is seeing your ""score card"" meeting your metrics means you did your job well (performance)"
good,"Loved working for Comcast, benefits of working for them were outstanding. Just not enough wiggle room when it comes to moving inside the company. Tough company to get involved with."
good,My most enjoyable part of the job is working with others and meeting new people.  The company as a whole is a great company to work for.  It is very diverse and offer equal opportunities.  Promoting within is also a big benefit.

I also enjoy the opportunity to work from home which is spectacular. other than that I must say its  a warm friendly atmosphere to work around."
good,A usual day at work making phone calls drinking coffee racing to making top sales of the day!!!! Fridays we raffle tickets off & win prizes
good,"A typical day as a Comcast technician involves much self reliance and knowledge of your work load. First, you take inventory of your van, making sure you have all the correct tools for the jobs assigned and equipment needed for any installations which may populate on your route. By providing this self driving approach this position has taught me how to prioritize my day, as well as provided me insight into the technological side of the industry. The management were great, quite a stress free work environment as long as you coordinate your day accordingly. The hardest part of the job would be climbing the poles, and locating the taps to feed the cable to the customer, its quite time consuming and you must be in good shape to carry and maneuver the large 28' ladders, but you get used to it after doing it for so long. I enjoyed the position, for me it was a pleasant working environment and allowed me the opportunity to learn the functionalities as well as the business side of the industry."

good,ok can have its ups and downs but what job doesn't. You just have to stay afloat and make your next move your best move. and everyone hates you because you are the one that comes to the front door and has to be given the harassment of why this.. or why that.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."

good,Any and all consideration to the associate is given to ensure the best output of service to the customer and giving back to the company. The wealth of information given access to for the customer is astounding.
good,I worked in the retention department.  The money & benefits are great! But it does get frustrated and irritable at times. Everyday it’s something different so you’ll never know what you’ll get when you enter into work. If you don’t like change at a blink of an eye; this isn’t for you.
good,Working for Comcast was a pleasure. It taught me skills in all avenues of work I would not have learned anywhere else. Very thankful for the opportunity to learn from the best sales people.
good,It's a really good company with a lot of room for growth. You might have to relocate to another city especially for the National positions. The pay is competitive and if your not careful you can get too comfortable and get stuck there believing there is nothing better out there.

good,Comcast is a great place to work. Great benefits. Department metrics are a bit harsh in an overall way of determining how good of a job you are doing.

good,I love Comcast. Everyday there is something new to learn. I loved a lot about its products and services. Management is always there to help when needed.

good,I enjiyed working at Xfinity. They are a fun workplace. And encouraged growth with advances in technology. I enjoyed interacting with customers and was impressed with management. They really care about their customers and want employees to be empowered to teach new innovations in internet and video. I was a video tech and they trained me for internet and sales. I attended at least one meeting per week and got lots of support from management. The training was fun and informative.
good,"My job as a technician at Comcast  has been excellent, I personally would like to stay with them but I want to work for Information Technology than Cable communication. Overall Comcast is a great company ."

good,"comcast has great benefits and management is great, its just a stressful job. you get access to great services which complimentary, lots of overtime opportunities."

good,The only complaint I could have for Comcast would be that the raises are not fair. The numbers you have to make within a 6 month cycle are very hard to reach. Also they get harder every year. Making it rough for the new guys. It’s at the point now where maybe 1-3 out of 30 techs get a raise. The odds are against you. Other than that it’s a good job.
good,"The typical day will have you doing cable math and check as well as running cable."
good,"Very good company to work for, you do have to learn a lot about cable and a lot about new equipment as things at advancing, I would have stayed with Comcast if I did not move."
good,"The day in and day out job was stressful because you are dealing with customers who have an issue with service, equipment, or their bill. The customers are yelling and demanding at times which adds to the stress of the situation. At the end of the day when you know that you have helped those customers and made the situation better for them it is worth all the stress and getting yelled at. Management was very present in the fact that if you needed assistance you had immediate response as to not keep the customer waiting. I wish i could have transferred from Florida to Illinois but there were no opportunities for the call center positions where i was moving to."
good,"i was honored to work under daniel dillard call center manager,and rashaad wilson and kelly browning my supervisors."
good,"I really enjoyed working for comcast. being involved with the volunteering in my community, miss having discounts on my internet funny. being able to share positive feed back on the products was a good practice with the discounted services"
good,"Most companies state that they are inclusive and diverse in their PR/Marketing spots but rarely match it behind the scenes. Comcast actually backs up their claim. I have never worked with a more diverse set of individuals nor have I ever seen a company that earnestly works to include all voices in the decision making processes. For a company as large as this, that's a daunting task but Comcast's culture and leadership drive those outcomes daily. Fantastic job to have!"
good,It was a good work experience.  It was a temporary job. There was a large high volume of calls and emails you had to respond to.  Some team players working at Comcast.
good,"The titled statement is a company slogan, and that is what you make it, and at the end, yes I loved my job. I truly appreciate the company. A manager is only as good as the person, and you can not directly blame a company on that. So as far as my direct leadership has gone, it's been up and down. The company however changed my life. Before I was working for a major pharmaceutical company barely making $9/hour, once I started with Comcast I immediately doubled that and included great perks and benefits. Of course you receive the standard vacation, 401k, tuition reimbursement, PLUS FREE CABLE and INTERNET! And your service never goes out or has issues, NEVER! You receive discounts and free tickets to universal studios plus a million other places. Like life and happiness, a job is what you make it, and Comcast is the company to work for in any job market."

good,"we had fuse ball, pinball  mach the break room, Free cable at your home, Great benefits and insurance for employees. They took pride in hiring in the area where you live which I thought that was great because when you are talking to customer you as the rep. would know the area which comes in handy when there is a problem. Also you kinda know what type of houses are in this area which is good for our techs"
good,"Outstanding place to work. Enjoyed working there. Great training, great Management. Very good workplace culture. Customer satisfaction. Everything geared toward customer Satisfaction."
good,"Management, supervisors, and HR are very supportive of the associates. Call flow varies, but is typically steady throughout the day. Comcast provides paid training both in classroom and computer settings.

good,This is a great place to work if you are looking for career opportunity.  They are nice and willing to give a hand to anyone that needs help to a certain extent
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Comcast.  The compensation was well above what I expected and the company as a whole felt like a welcoming place.  There were several amenities onsite at my location and they provided a well stocked benefit package.  The only reason that I left was because I was so used to working in a more active environment that I was unsuited for a desk job at the time.  Had I stayed another six months I would have had the opportunity to transfer to another department that would better suit my needs.  I would definitely return to the company.
good,"Comcast Billing was a very up to beat job the environment was great, everyone got along with everyone. it was a job of great energy. the flow of Comcast was a bit up and down but once you figured out the motion you could ride along smooth."

good,"Comcast was a great company to work for, and I learned a lot while I worked there. was able to work from home when I needed to take care of my sick mother which really helped during that tough time."
good,The environment was very competitive but with positive opportunities to be successful. Leadership had high expectations on performance but offered lots of coaching. Benefits were very great for full time employees.

good,"Daily Interaction with new and perspective clients attempting to upsell and to be made to  feel at ease. I learned time management, goal attainment, team unity to obtain the ultimate goal which was customer satisfaction. Hardest part of the job was being away from home and family. Most enjoyable part of my job was making those around me satisfied, content and happy!"
good,"Worked alongside managers, supervisors, and janitors, everyone working hand-in-hand with no feeling of superiority, it didn't matter the job, whether it was raking up leaves to repairing the electric wires across the building."

good,"Good place to work, excellent salary and benefits, ability to work on cutting edge technology."
good,I will always value the teaching and coaching brought by Comcast Management. I learned hard core sales and will never forget the work ethic and family within that made it pleasant to work with.
good,"I've been at Comcast for over 2 years now, and I can honestly say that they will help you get to where you want to be, but there is a price to pay, your dignity and self-respect. If you're willing to kiss up and disrespect your own character and self-image then, by all means, go for it. Overall, the company is great! The pay is fantastic and the benefits are phenomenal. Working in the call center aspect, you must have A-LOT OF PATIENCE. People will get under your skin and management will micro-manage you. The company does respect the culture and the people it employs. If you are apart of the LGBT community, Comcast will stand behind your back. If you have a disability don't think they will not hire you just because, trust and believe they will be looking to hire anyone."
good,I enjoyed working at Comcast.   I just had some family issues that have now been completed. I learned how to sale and how to work with internet and cable issues.

All tools and training are paid for and supplied as needed by the company. Training is very thorough and precise. The ability for advancement was fantastic.

good,"Being in Retail, hours could exceed 8 per day, and high turnover rate due to sales environment, but quotas were easy to meet, management was great...."
good,If you’re a go getter and have excellent people skills then this job is perfect. If you are lazy and don’t like meeting new people daily then don’t waste your time
good,As the company grew the management didn't. The management needed better leadership and sales training. (My manager had never sold or been in customer service but had grown through dispatch and internally)

Needed to check routers and video boxes for any diagnostic problem and put aside for inventory on all the products, wrap the video boxes and other merchandise ready to send to other shopping stores for customer wants."
good,"Comcast was the best company I've worked for,  wish I was still with the company. The benefits are amazing, the opportunities were endless, and the company really cared about it's employees."
good,Work hard and keep your head low and you'll be fine. Management rewards hard work and dedication. Try to get along with everyone and it should be smooth sailing.
good,It was a very collaborative and competitive environment and it was a learning period for me everyday which I came to know more about the individual responsibilities in a team and how to be communicate with others in a efficient way and the management is never make the employees feel stress where it was the most appreciate and healthy part in the work environment and hardest part of my job is troubleshooting  the networking environment and load balancing also those are the most enjoyable part of my job
good,Great place to work. The team is very helpful and understanding. People are very friendly and willing to share their knowledge with each other. I have experience a workplace where people from the multiple venues are willing to take time to make sure new employees learn how to do everything that is required to complete all aspect of the financial picture of that venue.

Everyone is amazing and very helpful always willing to help especially managers. Team oriented and great place to work. They always have fun things planned when I worked at the call center in Oregon they had a lot of fun things to do and Goals were reachable and are adjusted accordingly. I worked with an amazing energetic team I miss them but am still in contact with a lot of them. Comcast is not just a work place it is a Family. They have amazing time off after 90 Days and they offer matching 401K as well as great vision, dental, and medical benefits. Customers can be rough sometimes but that happens anywhere you work. Commission is great! Comcast is an Amazing place to work. Highly recommend."
good,"This was my first position in the field of information security. I learned tremendously from supervisors as well as those who came before me. The environment was very relaxed as far as attitude went but fast paced in the need to get work done. Downtime at work was non-existent, but the work was such that I didn't mind the business."
good,A very fast paced work environment. I exercised a great deal of time management and sales along with ensuring  customer satisfaction. Great growth opportunities and compensation.
good,"This company is constantly changing.  Considering its a communications company, they are exceptionally poor at communicating those changes. Great benefits though!"
good,I enjoyed working as a contractor for this company and would do it again at the drop of a hat.  The company welcomed me and provided training and enabled me to work with the product knowledge I needed to be successful.

good,"Comcast is an amazing company to work for, they offer great benefits and the work relations is as close to family in the work field as it gets (other than Military). Your provided with exceptional training for those with no experience and awesome refresher for those with experience. My only complaint would be starting salary is pretty low and can make it challenging with a family. On the other hand They do offer plenty of opportunities for growth.  Hated having to leave this company but had to relocate and my current area does not provide Comcast services."
good,"I loved every part of working for Comcast. The leadership was awesome, new challenges on a daily basis, great benefits, and unlimited career growth opportunities available. I would recommend job seekers to work there."
good,Great career start if you have the time to invest benefits are great and with time salaries can be also. Exceptional fast pace environment. Very helpful Co workers and diverse environment
good,I learned a lot at Comcast.  My years there were very enjoyable.  The different departments worked together to take care of the customers needs.  Offering customers a wide range of products and services made the company competitive in the market.
good,The company has some great benefits but the stress level is a bit excessive for the amount of pay. The Comcast Business division needs to be more organized.
good,Great company to work for would go back tomorrow! My manager at the time was the Best!! RB!!  Boca Raton FL.  If you know your product and have a great work ethic there's nothing to stop you from making 6 figures! Period!!!!!!!!!!!!!?
good,Great company to work for this is a career job and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something long term with excellent benefits. The staff is great and helpful and management knows what they're doing. The training is weeks long but it's worth it because you will have to learn a lot and there is a lot to learn.

good,pay is ok after you have some time in. long hours but you get to start from your house and use company vehicle. sometimes the sudden changes can be aggravating
good,"I only worked there a short amount of time, but I must say it was an enjoyable company to work for. The quota that was set for the store location I was at was attainable and also possible to exceed. It was fair. And although this was a fast paced and goal oriented environment, it was never stressful and it was laid back. The benefits were also a plus."
good,"Learned a lot of the cable business working here, everyone one worked together to get the job done, a very family oriented atmosphere. it was just a great place to work"

You should not apply for this job if you cannot deal with rude and abusive customers over the phone. You have no idea how angry customers get when their cable service is interrupted. Managers and supervisors help you succeed. If you are good with people and have a thick skin, this may be the job for you. great benefits and Comcast stock retirement benefits."

good,"I work with comcast over 2 years  Unfortunately the group I worked with was transfer to Atlanta or Nashville otherwise I would still be working with this group Both the supervisors and the fellow employees made it worthwhile being there"
good,"Comcast is a great place to work. All of the benefits not including the steeply discounted cable are all top tier! The pay is very competitive and there is a path to advancement for agents. If you are an individual contributor you sort of need to make your own path which is likely to be blocked by bureaucracy. However,  if you are patient you will get there. Overall great place to work. They are focusing more on improving the customer experience so it can only get better."
good,They have outstanding paid training and great instructors. Comcast offers a great culture to grow in to management. The people are very professional and have great attitudes. One of my favorite jobs.

The most difficult of the job was getting used to the corporate aspects.

good,It was a positive great experience for myself in the corporate sales industry. I learned a lot about the professional pace corporate sales create.
good,I love the positive attitude of management and the effort to build teams. Where I think help is needed is to improve the sales computer system as it is a difficult system to learn and in the way of making sales.
good,"Working at Comcast has given me the opportunity to develop myself; take the time to grow and learn, and that was really important to me during the time in my life when I joined the company. If you have the drive and ambition, there are a ton of ways in which you can grow into a leader if that's what you want to be. I took advantage of the continued education benefit and am finishing my masters degree now... I also joined a couple of the employee resource groups which offer seminars and networking events that support your professional profile. Listen, I'm not a total nerd. The point of my post is that this isn't a company you join and just stay stale within."
good,"Well balanced and well structured company, good benefits and great pay. Balancing home life and work life can be struggling at times but is fully worth it. Overall, Comcast is a great choice for anyone looking to fulfill a great career in the telecommunications industry."
good,"A typical day for me working in direct sales at Comcast would consist of me heading to the office in the morning to do some paperwork and research on the computer for various reasons. After that I would head to the ""field"", which is what it's called when we are in our assigned locations and knocking doors and engaging with potential or current customers. Two days I would have meetings with the rest of the team while I'm at the office. I've learned a lot from this company, from improving my sales tactics to meeting deadlines on paperwork and the proper process for everything involved. Leadership I would have to say is one of the best concepts of Comcast, specifically my region. Upper leadership isn't anyone's favorite, but my direct supervisor is the most compassionate boss I've ever had the pleasure of working with. My coworkers have always been supportive even though we primarily work alone. Hardest part of this job is you're primarily working on your own, so a lot of self motivation and determination is important. Most enjoyable part of Comcast is the flexible hours, benefits, pay and my direct supervisor."
good,Good solid job and better people.  Worked service and install for many years.  Customers were also a great part of job.  New people everyday kept the job fresh.  Technology of the company is always at the forefront.

good,"Asign turf door to door sales,"
good,"I have been working at Comcast (More than a Year)."
good,"When arriving work you'll find many smiling faces and several Good Mornings, then you get right to work logging in and facing your day. Mine starts with packages delivered and need sorting and email notices sent along with keeping logs. Thus, over 25 years ago, I had a great opportunity to learn Excel along with the Microsoft office package to advance my work and trim the learning curve as well as having a great management crew to help along. Although the job was fairly easy when working with great team players but is really a rough task when players are missing or on vacations. But can be fun when short cuts are applied and some of those were fun to create with the help of using Microsoft Word."

good,Working at Comcast was a great learning experience. Comcast showed me that it is important to have fun and enjoy your co workers. I looked forward to coming to work each day. A typical day at Comcast was very fast paced. Taking around 50-60 calls a day. The hardest part of the job was when the computers shut down and trying to maintain the calls without access to their profile. The most enjoyable part of the job was checking how many sales I closed at the end of the day and also just coming to work overall.

good,"Proud to work for a company with so many great products."
good,"I make sure we always have available days for the customers to be installed, repaired and make sure our technicians are productive and schedules are correct."
good,Overall a good company to work for. Somewhat depends on the division but my work in software development (content discovery for X1 platform) was great. Only downside is that it's the company everyone loves to hate.
good,"I'm on the phone the entire job time in the day.  I've learned a lot about selling over the phone v/s face to face."

good,The hardest part of the job is working endlessly providing customers an affordable rate for their services even when they are insistent on portraying the company in a bad light.  The services are great and the company plans on improving their products and services going forward.  I have learned so much in the seven years that I have worked for the company and have really grown.  It is very stressful but rewarding at the same time.

good,"A typical day at work is sitting at my desk most of the day scheduling commercials in the Novar system so they can air on television. Sometimes you can hear a pin drop cause everyone is busy like bees working hard.. then you can hear laughter, joking (all within reason) to break the some what monotony. We have fun days for employee appreciation, committee's such as Wellness and Credo. I'm a part of the Credo committee, we are the liaison between the employees and upper management. We figure ways to keep the fun and joy of coming to work and also concerns that need to be addressed. "

I trained over 20 agents while I was there and enjoyed selling the value of the products we sold.  I learned numerous things about the cable industry.  The ins and outs of all the comcast equipment boxes.  The hardest part was having to tell a customer no, when there was no way we could full fill their request.  We would always look for an answer but sometimes there just wasn't a way.The most enjoyable was when you knew you had helped someone who couldn't fix their problem on their own."

I learned how to improve my Customer Service skills and also adapted to working under high stress level within the workplace. Management were usually busy and had no time to thoroughly assist reps. Co-workers helped each other due to the fact that management was rarely available. The hardest part of my job was limiting my responsibilities, because I like to learn and support others in their endeavors. The most enjoyable part of my job was de-escalating my calls with the upset customer by resolving their issues."

good, Comcast believes in superior customer service and saving all customers from leaving the company.  I learned to appreciate and take pride in my customer service skills. The hardest part of the job is unsatisfied customers with many complaints. The most enjoyable part of the job is winning over the unsatisfied customers and hearing all of the nice comments after all issues are fix/corrected.

good,"I work in the Finance Department in the Advertising Division of Spotlight. My job is transitioning to Atlanta and I will be losing my job effective 06/28/13. I have truly enjoyed working with the finance group, we would all reach out to help our co-workers that were located in other markets. I could not have asked to work for any better management team. When we were told about the transition and the lay-offs, we all agreed that it was like losing part of our own family. I worked mostly with AR, I honestly have to say that there was nothing that I did not like about my job."
good,"Comcast is the largest telecom company in the world. If you're going to work in this industry, this is the company to work for. As a DSR, you work targeted areas ""door to door"", looking for new customers or bringing back those who have left. Door to door isn't fair or accurate to describe the job. You have targeted specific information for about 75% of the people you'll speak with. It lends itself to a tremendous amount of credibility. Will you get rejected? Will you get the door slammed in your face? Absolutely. Every day. If you don't have thick skin (the ability to take rejection), then this isn't for you. Look elsewhere--you won't make your numbers and you'll be let go. If you are disciplined, you'll look past these people and find your new customers. Targeted commission + base = $72,000.00 per year. Excellent benefits and lots of room to move up. The job has it's negatives--working in all weather, changes in programs, etc. Again, it's a big company. If you can roll with the changes, there is a LOT of money to be made, and it can be made honestly and ethically."
good,"great place to work if love to travel and meet new people, do not have much supervision but are required to meet time frames"
good,i want to work for comcast and be an installer or work in there warehouse the company is the best one to work for.
good,A typical day at work is usually stress free. I learned both sales and customer relations along with team management as did my co-workers. Very few issues with 'undesirables' and the hardest part of my job is hard to identify since working there is so stress-free. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be the customers!
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is being able to assist customers and provide services that they desired by request for enjoyment or need.The hardest part was not being able to make everyone happy due to financial issues or services unable to render to the customer. i learned how to upscale to a customer to meet there need and how to retain a customer.The co workers were family oriented into teams that strive together to meet what ever goal was set from the company.
good,"I was able to work with my hands and think, by solving technical problems. It is a pleasure to solve a customers issue with their service.

good,"work hard / lots of phone calls from clients, need to understand cable with trainig, good people and understanding managers"
good,"Great company, always changing for the best, good start off pay, good people"
good,"A typical day was from the moment you clocked in, and logged into your phone, taking in bound calls about customers’ accounts and products. Management was great and was always open to questions and concerns about policies and anything else. Hardest part was the fast pace of things but management were always more than happy to help you keep up with the pace and help with anything you needed."
good,"Comcast was an exciting place to work. With all kinds of people from all walks of life, it was interesting. Of course our main concern was assisting the customers, but what I liked about comcast is that they encouraged us to build a rapport was our customers and treat each one as an individual. We received a high volume of calls on a day to day basis, but this made the day go by fast and it also made the representatives feel productive throughout the day. We had the opportunity to work with different supervisors, I enjoyed each one. The most difficult thing about this position was dealing with irrate customers, but I enjoyed giving these customers my best effort in resolving their issues which typically changed their mood and their outlook on the company."

They offer great benefits for their employees and the employees pets. I am no longer employed with them because my department complete staff was laid off due to restucturing but I do not regret a single moment I had with Comcast. If you live near Comcast you should apply for employment with them because they are a great place to work. They believe in helping their employees and the community.
good,"Fun environment to work in. Management cares about employee success and will help in any way to help employees reach goals. Company has a high customer service reputation, working with customers to solve issues and concerns."
good,There is opportunity to grow within the company but at some point unless an employee is willing to relocate it is hard to promote.  Employees progress three times and then promote up to four levels.
good,I've worked at Comcast for 15 years. Comcast strives to create a great culture by focusing on their people and their culture. Comcast makes the right moves to stay competitive in an evolving market.

good,Working a Comcast gave me the foundation to make other career changes with an expectation of compensation worthiness and job security. If you meet sales goals and follow policy Comcast is a great workplace.
good,"Hours varied depending on what your responsibilities were on any given day. We didn't control when the teams held practices or events, we covered them. The culture was fantastic. It was a start-up network and there was positive encouragement all around as people were allowed to take chances and stretch theirs and the network's abilities to see what was possible. The hardest part of the job was making sure you kept up with what everyone else was doing. You never wanted to let people down. The best part was seeing your work and people telling you what a great job you did."
good,"I worked at various broadband companies in the San Jose area. As one was bought out by another. For the most part I was able to continue to work with the same co-workers I started working with 30+yrs before. I was part of the management team for awhile, returning to the field for the last 12 years. I always enjoyed working with my hands outside the best."
good,so there's always huddles going on so we're always learning new stuff and coaching is always available too. people are great to work with management is great I think the heardiest part about he job is getting people into to the doors I just don't think everyone knows we are here but there is a lot of advertisement going on so that's good
good,my coworkers were very helpful and patient in helping me learn my job. Management was very professional and always looked forward to going to work every day.
good,"It’s an okay place to work, but trying to move to different positions after college has been difficult. Management only sees what your current title is not your accomplishments."
good,"Very fun if you like being outdoors, some long hours, and weekends, and holidays. Good Compensation. Moving to the telecommute side was slot less stressful."
good,Excellent people to work with that are family focused.When you consider your co-workers like brothers & sisters your in a rare environment.The demands of the job are substantial but you gain knowledge & understanding as you progress through the processes you are taught along the way.A Class organization that's true assets are the people that make it great
good,Your day is very busy. Everyone there is very friendly. The management learns and helps their employees. Fun work environment and great employees. The hardest part of the job is nobody gives the same answer so customers have bad experiences because there is no One said answer. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get off work.
good,"This job changed my life.  The environment, the continued support. It truly is a great place to work. Even supervisors make you feel equal and welcome."
good,Comcast is a great place to work. Coworkers are upbeat and friendly. Management is there for you at all times. The company policies are current and promote diversity and fairness. Wages are good and benefits as well. Paid time off begins after your 90 period. The Customer Sales Representative position is hourly plus commission. I enjoyed my time working there.
good,"Comcast is a future focused large company that has great benefits for it's worker.  I have worked with Comcast for 12 Years and although I may not always agree with the companies politics, I can't complain about their work environment."
good,"Comcast is the leading global media and technology company.  I sold cable, high-speed internet, and  home telephone service.  I had to communicate and develop rapport and explain our products in-depth and recommend the right solutions. I maneuvered between 8 different computer applications. Quick and accurate decision making in a fast paced environed. I had to bring on  new customers and upgrade existing customers.  I was top producer during my entirety in sales department. I left Comcast to go to college"
good,"I left because I was dumb and got mad instead of addressing my issues. Only downfall is the times for new hires is 1-10. Shift bid once a year based off performance and metrics which also determines your raises. Shift bid goes off of metrics and seniority level. When I left I still did not have even 1 weekend day off. They do offer lots of PTO and vacation days. Also, they feed you ALOT!"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is doing it with the passion. Time management plays a major key role. Adaptability is the best thing that i have learned here.
good,"I have worked in 5 call centers, from banking to telemarketing, this Comcast center is different then all of them. The metrics for your phone time is not only reasonable but is changed when needed to support the agents better. The paid time off you receive, alone, is enough to surpass any company I have worked for. The community with in the call center is unique and uplifting."
good,"I enjoyed working at Comcast. Not only did I meet lots of new people, but I was able to overcome the challenges of my position, which is the most rewarding thing. I would definitely recommend Comcast as a company to work for as they have a lot to offer their employees, and There is always room to grow."
good,"Great company to work for. Excellent benefits, generous time off, great culture. Management could be improved. They put too much on the supervisors, which doesn’t allow them to concentrate more on the actual real aspects of the job."
good,managers and employees are on very strict metrics reviewed each week in team meetings.  well preforming teams are rewarded as well as employees who meet and exceed metrics.
good,This was an enjoyable place to work at. Some of the upper management tended to target people based on how they felt about them regardless of there performance.
good,"Comcast Spotlight is an excellent organization that has gone through dramatic changes in the last three years in order to remain competitive.  It went from being very market based, to a matrix structure."
good,"Working for a cable company has its perks. You get discounted cable, internet and phone services along with decent medical, dental, vision, and life insurance packages."

good,Comcast is a fast paced environment. They treat their employees well. The hardest part of is keeping up with a forever changing environment.  Great place to work.
good,"Comcast is a great place to work for people who enjoy a fast-paced and ever-changing environment. Being part of the technology sector of the world, Comcast is always changing to keep pace with advancements in technology. It is almost certain that things will change monthly to keep pace with these advancements. You also must be able to work diligently on your own without supervision and still get your work done on time. The perks and benefits provided by Comcast are next to none. Top notch in my opinion. Paternal and Maternal leave are HUGE bonuses for parents."
good,"Comcast is a great place to work! Management is fully engaged, concerned, and each Manager and Supervisor works diligently to ensure the success of their employees."
good,A Normal work day is pretty is easy going. I've learned how to manage the flow of traffic and train new hires in cable services and systems. the culture is really a work hard play hard culture overall a really great experience .
good,Benefits package is nice. Fast pace call center. Can be stressful. Co workers made the job fun. Good work/life balence. Pay was on the low end for the amount of work.
good,"Very demanding job both physically and mentally. Pay was very good and supervisors were great mentors. Lots of growth opportunity and benefits from 401k to stock options, and not to mention an incredibly generous combined 168 hours of paid time off per year starting off are hard to beat. You will meet many new people traveling so much and going into people's houses to service their needs, but that is also a part of the stressfulness of the job dealing with customers who are already angry when you get there because of a foreign call center representative that had no idea what their issue really was. But this was also the most rewarding part of the job because it was our mission as the front line of Comcast to make sure we left every customer with a feeling of satisfaction before we leave making sure we take the time to understand their issues and LISTEN to their problems."
good,"I love working for Comcast. I've been here a year and a half. In that time I was trained and promoted twice, now a CE3. Wonderful benefits, most of my co-workers and sups are great. Awesome culture. I just really wish there was more opportunity to work earlier hours. I understand there's more demand for later agents but it's just not working for me. That is the hardest part, because I want the fact that we need agents working later to not be true!! Haha. If you have experience in basic customer service, have patience and prefer to work nights, WORK AT COMCAST!! You also get commission if you're great at sales, as well as a sweet internet/cable package through courtesy services. Seriously."
good,I enjoyed working for the company very much so. I was very familiar with change that took place the seven years I was there. I learned how to de escalate customers very well and how to make them feel very comfortable as their representative.
good,You must know how to sell to do well in this job. This is a sales job and has customer service. requires standing most of your shift and depending on location will have many customers only speaking Spanish.
good,"I was a Telesales agent at Comcast and was very good at it.  I won 35 awards for 300% in sales each month within a year and 8 star pins because of attendance and good sportsmanship. I used multiple computers along with a headset to accomplish my goals.  I also used discovery questions and rebuttles in order to encourage my customers to purchase products. I had to understand, learn, and know the products that I was selling in order to be effective.  And I did.  I have very strong influencing skills.  I learned new applications such as: CSG and Vision. Management was excellent! The culture was nice as well because being able to work with different nationalities was a plus.  The hardest part of the job was when there were technical issues and the programs were not responding, however we always had the Technical Support department ready to take care of those issues.  The most enjoyable part was making those sales and meeting new people.  Also being rewarded for your good work."
good,"Grear place to work, however, highly stressful working in the retention department. Coworkers feel like family and you get out of Comcast what you give it. Great opportunity for advancement and commission."
good,lots of diversity. opportunity to travel to another state. good reward for high performers. good recognition. employee discount. tuition reimbursement. call center job is stressful.
good,"Comcast Business offers an excellent opportunity for learning, career building and over all growth. Comcast is the first company I have ever worked for that allowed me to take care of my family without needing to work multiple jobs."
good,"Great benefits, fun environment, flexible hours, though pay was not as high as I liked, I lived too far away to justify the commute.  It was a fun place to work though, and the discounts on cable packages are unparalleled."
good,"would get a route each day to run an most days you could get it all done within your 10 hour day . I got most of my low volt experience for cable tv , phone , enternet . some of the best on hands training you get"
good,"Es un gran lugar para poder obtener un primer empleo. Tomas muhas madurez en este entorno, ademas de que puedes llevar tu vida laboral, y estudiar al mismo tiempo."

good,Comcast has great products that you can utilize almost anywhere you go.  Working at Comcast is relaxed.  Managers that I've worked with are fair and understanding with work/home life.
good,Great for sales people who are driven to win. Tons of sales contest and incentives to keep you motivated. Management is always willing to help you with your development.
good,Comcast is a communications giant that struggles every day with the problems of a diverse workforce and a high tech environment. There is a fine balance between work environment and customer expectations.  Comcast has been successful at establishing a parity between the two.
good,"You don't quit a job your quit your leadership.  Awesome company, great values and stand behind their employees.  I would recommend working for Comcast to a friend."
good,"Great work-life balance"
good,"Working for Comcast cable was a great experience. I have learned and acquired new skills and talents. All companies their adversities but in an overall experience, I would not have changed the time I've spent with this company."
good,"Great environment"
good,It was a nice place to work at and also a nice environment. Nice and competitive pay. paid vacation and also 401k and health benefits. Nice coworkers.
good,"Even though I went through a temp agency, I love the fact that I was able to move up. It included great benefits and worked with you to balance family and work life."
good,"Everyone has heard of Comcast. The cable company gets mocked as much as any company out there. But that does not mean it is not a great place for innovation, hard work, fun, success and satisfaction. At Comcast you get all of that and more. Being on the cutting edge of technology was great."
good,The IT team was the best and the employees that i dealt with. The hardest part was the stress that some managers posed on us which made our job stressful
good,Comcast is great place to work.  The culture is good.  The people are nice and I feel supported in my development as an employee.  Leadership is engaging and I would recommend it as a place to work.
good,"Challanging to work for but in a good way. As a technician, every job site was a puzzle and as services became more technical the puzzles became more intriguing."
good,great work place but they want you to fulfill all these procedures but don't want to pay you what you worth its great talent here in dc but the money is no good only reason im considered leaving I don't want to but I have to for my family
good,Comcast provides employees with all the tools needed to perform their duties and ongoing training.  this is an ever changing environment and you need to be flexible with ongoing changes. The atmosphere of diversity is fantastic. They reward their employees for the hard work that they put in. Contests and fun environment and opportunity for growth.
good,"I was a supervisor at the CAMC in Knoxville, Tn for over a year. The place was amazing to work for. I think people that came into the call center just looking to make a paycheck...probably would have less positive things to say. I was there for career advancement and became a supervisor in exactly 1 year making almost $60k per year with amazing benefits. The facility is amazing, with lots of employee perks. There is literally something going on there for employees to participate in every day...we even had a Great Place to Work Team, that came up with fun activities for employees to participate in. Great supervisors that want to see you succeed if you WORK for it."
good,This is a very good company with an almost family atmosphere.  You will not get rich but there are alot of opportunities for advancement.  It is what you make it.
good,Workplace culture is everything at comcast. Everyone came to work excited and enthusiastic.  Hardest part of the job was trying to help everyone and fulfill your duties.
good,"In my role as Customer Service Supervisor a typical day was working hand in hand with my reps. in order to provide support and improve performance, thru call monitoring and individualized coaching. Great benefits, clear career paths and continued training."
good,"Great place to work. great benefits, but they should increase the salaries. Also, the promotions are really hard to get. There is a moment in which you fill stuck because the promotions are a few and there are a lot of people to compete with."
good,"Working at Comcast has given me the opportunity to develop myself; take the time to grow and learn, and that was really important to me during the time in my life when I joined the company. If you have the drive and ambition, there are a ton of ways in which you can grow into a leader if that's what you want to be. I also joined a couple of the employee resource groups which offer seminars and networking events that support your professional profile. The point of my post is that this isn't a company you join and just stay stale within. They encourage your growth, but it's up to you to make it happen. Not only this - it's pretty exciting. Emplyees again get the continued education plus free cable/internet, top health care benefits and a truly balanced lifestyle - which is rarely the case within the Tech industry."
good,Job is great. People are great. Facility is nice. The customers can be unreasonable at times. All in all I'd work there again. Only left to pursue different interests.
good,I love working at Comcast which is why I have been here for 20+ years.  They regularly provide leadership training and look to hire from within.  There are many avenues to build a career at Comcast.

Includes extensive training, carreer development, performance driven focus, and great individual development programs are made available to assist front line on their development. NPS (Net Promoter Score System) is the area of focus that allows the company to understand the needs of the internal and external customers so that necessary changes can be implemented.

good,Great place to work and amazing group of coworkers. Benefits are outstanding and time off was very generous. Plenty of room to grow and guidance to do so.

good,This company really strives to help their employees and help them succeed. They always have incentives and commissions. They hold food days and employee appriciation. i have never been anywhere better to work.
good,"Comcast has probably the best benefits I've ever experienced at a company.  Besides nearly free cable, you also get great health/dental benefits.  Management tends to play allot of favoritism, but still overall a great company to work for."
good,The workplace culture is an inclusive one. I have learned a great deal of customer service skills over my course of eight years with Comcast. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction that comes from solving a customer's inquiry.
good,we'll miss that place.. hands down the best job ive ever had.. and i dont have a minimum of a hundred and fifty characters. amazing job. i just wish that one day wasnt that day ... lol
good,"Unfortunately I had to leave the company earlier than planned due to having to relocate. Now I have found my home in Littleton. Everyone there had such different backgrounds which is why we all got along so well. Comcast as a company is one that is not bias at all. The pay was great, your schedule didn't change too much, etc. It was a great place to work and everyone took me on as their own to help me advance everyday."
good,"Inlove comcast. Great training on products , great comission. Flexibility hours very innovative company continues training s always traing on new apps such as vision or csg"
good,"Comcast has a great culture, great people, good management, and a corporate mission that includes caring for its people. From bottom to top, this is a well-run company."

Great life and work balance.Had a chance to do home shows as a Comcast relations representative.,excellent experience. Pace of work was excellent culture was very upbeat with a focus on workers."
good,"Conduct morning meeting, train new reps in the field. Produce new business.  Perform sales presentations in the field, and in the office, Provide superior customer service.  The hardest part about working with Comcast was cleaning up behind there customer service errors. We crated our own work place culture because we were outside sales reps, we managed our own time and work schedule.  I was also responsible tor organizing team non work related events.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working in the field with new reps, meeting new customer and generating new business."
good,Comcast is a fun and innovative company to work for. It is a company that truly believes in training employees and continuously fortifying workers with information on changing technology.
good,"nothing bad to say about  Comcast it is a Great company to work for and i would love to work for them again here in Pittsburgh, pa. i tell every one one about working for them literally."
good,"Comcast is an excellent organization,  I am very happy working here. The only downside is the limitation on location for my position. The do not believe in remote teams even if you work where a Comcast office is located. I don't want to leave Comcast but may have to in order to find a job that will allow me to relocate closer to family."
good,Environment is awesome and the people. Always willing to help reps out if needed more training or so. Work stations were always clean an presentable like it was your home

good,"Sales position was competitive and quota based.  The leadership, team and work environment was helpful in my success.   The guidelines were strict without any deviations."
good,"Awesome benefits, great place to work. Many opportunities to advance. Customer service can be stressful but management is a great support system. Pay could be better but the great benefits almost make up for it."

good,"Comcast is a wonderful company, great benefits, and great environment.  I just need a better job with a better pay, flexible schedules. There's a gym at the site. People are wonderful. The hardest part is not having all the training needed to do the job. Also, the system used is not friendly at all, thank God that will change soon."
good,Comcast has given my life back from being a disabled veteran to working and gaining my life back. Comcast takes care of their employees and fairly compensated for our hard working.Comcast is an amazing place to work.
good,Lots to learn and remember but keeps you busy and you feel valued by the company. 75lbs ladder took my about 10 uses once I was outta training to feel totally normal with. Our team communicates so well it's almost like you're never alone on a job.
good,"Very Employee oriented and fun place to work. It was competitive and had a high turnover rate, but if you were succesful, the pay was very rewarding. My team was very high energy and a joy to work with."
good,"Great place to work! Benefits are awesome from the 401k, which the company matched 6.5%. The tuition reimbursement is pretty good. The discounts that  the company provides are unreal."
good,Everyone there is helpful and willing to teach anybody.  Another good thing is that there is complementary internet/tv for your home.  Another great thing is the cafeteria and the fitness center they have.
good,"The job gives you a lot of benefits , but the pay is too low. It also hurts when the quality of your work is way better then others and it doesn't get recognized, there advancement program is really unfair also."
good,Make calls to customers and talk about products to hopefully upgrade their services. Also try and help save money. Always follow guidelines that are giving because calls are being record.
good,"i had a job helping customers reset their modem to get them back online. i am very good at this kind of job because they teach you what they want you to know about computers.  i still remember how to do this. my manager was a very nice man and ienjoyed working for him.  T"

good,"I have really enjoyed working at Comcast. The pay is fair. The benefits are fantastic, including essentially free cable/internet/home security. In certain departments, there is significant possibility of advancement (Care, Tech-Ops). Managers are almost universally great people to work for."
good,I was very successful with Comcast and they treated me great!  If you work hard you have a very good opportunity to advance and be successful. The company listens to their employees more than mnost companies do.

good,It is very difficult to meet the goals in Comcast sales.  If you meet the goals you are compensated well.  I made on average 5500.00 a month before taxes.  Management is great and supervisors are great.  I was fired for attendance due to family issues but they worked with me A LOT so I don't blame them for it.  I recommend this job.
good,"My overall day at Comcast took about 50-60 calls a day created tickets for each call, troubleshooting. I have learned call forwarding, the work place was great everyone got along with each other, the hardest part of the job was remembering all scripts. I enjoyed that all supervisors always there to help no matter what, also co-workers. I just loved Comcast"
good,My experience at Comcast has been fantastic!  Great organization and great leadership.  The growth of the organization is absolutely crazy which creates a very fast paced day.
good,Comcast was a great place to work. They treat you like family. Job security. You really fire yourself. They will give anyone the benefit of the doubt and will get you help if needed.
good,"Employee's all treated fairly and nicely, place was ran well and you could tell cared about their employees and did a lot for them.A little over strict about their attendance policy, which is understandable especially during your training period, but once outside of the classroom environment, things should be taken down a notch that they don't do."
good,"I work part-time. Get paid hourly, commission and bonuses and incentives. Get benefit package. On overtime weekend they will double and sometimes triple commission. Great motivating supervisors. I feel the commission payout could be bigger."
good,I loved working for Comcast not only were the people great but the management was awesome! The benefits were some of the best I ever had. Base pay was high and commission higher! The stock options were awesome as well as 401k. I am sad that I left such an amazing company.  The only thing that was hard were all the upset customers calling that did wear on you. But the pay and commission made up for it. When I was there the company was in a huge growth process. It was a very exciting time to work for the company. I would highly recommend the company to anyone looking for a great long term career!!!!
good,"I love working for Comcast. My team is in an environment that encourages growth and taking a chance on new ideas."

good,"I am fortunate to have the opportunity to work for an Industry Leading Fortune 50 Telecommunications company that cares about their customers and employees.  Off the street, Comcast provides the opportunities to build a life-long career which is only limited by your ambition."
good,I loved working for xfinity as a dispatcher.  The employees were all very nice and management very considerate to the employees needs and concerns. Scheduling was flexible and pay was good. Plus lots of opportunity to advance.
good,"I had a wonderful experience! My manager was absolutely fantastic. She trusted me to work on my own projects and brought it to upper management's attention, which is what most employees usually want. Appreciation. "
good,Very good job. Always active. Great Customer service. Learn something new everyday. Provide Customers with information about their account. Thats what I like to do be able to clear and questions.
good,"Comcast believes in work/life balance. It's not something they just ""preach"" and don't actually do, they follow through. So many days off are available to all employees. There is a wonderful compensation package, to include decent pay, benefits & a wonderful discounted package for the services."

good,"During my time at Comcast-Spectacor, I was a Human Resources intern.  I interviewed incoming intern candidates for the upcoming semester, I worked with managers to determine what their intern levels should be, I conducted phone interviews with candidates to determine whether or not they would advance to an in person interview, along with running the day to day operations of the internship program.  I learned a lot through this program.  I learned how an HR department is run and what it takes to run the business behind the scenes.  I learned a lot about my organizational skills and worked on them throughout my time there.  The culture of Comcast-Spectacor is very relaxed and laid back.  It was a great place to start out in the business world.  I was able to go to anyone and ask questions, or find out more about what their job entailed.  The hardest part of the job for me was making phone calls to candidates.  I was uncomfortable making phone calls like that but it helped me come out my shell in that area and has helped me grow as an employee."
good,"Door to Door sales, following leads, setting appointments"
good,i enjoy my job everyday is something different and you meet new people every day. I feel valued as an employee and I love getting a company vehicle to travel to work and back.

good,Working at Comcast made me feel very accomplished it was the perfect 9-5 job and paid well.

Collections wasn't the easiest field to get into but with the help of my supervisor I quickly succeeded in my team.

good,"Very hecktic, but fun. Constant phone calls. You will learn a lot about telecommunications. Management is very easy to talk to and are very knowledgeable. Hardest part is how much changes and how often. Most enjoyable is the co-workers. Everyone is willing to help you or answer questions for you."
good,"Making calls to existing customers and providing them with company products and services."
good,"Fast paced, great place to work. Small environment and great people to work with. Plenty of growth opportunities. The company really does value their employees."
good,Awesome! The pay is the biggest are that needs improvement. The employees can be negative in regards to the company and they could benefit from some employee engagement activities.

The hardest part about my job is seeing customers leave our company. The most enjoyable part about  my job is putting smiles on our customers face and giving excellent customer services."

good,"The paid off time was fantastic: 10-days vacation the first year, 6 company holidays, 3 floating holidays and 8 personal flexible days. The complimentary services (extended basic video and basic high speed internet) are great if you live in a Comcast serviced area.

good,I've learned so much during my tenure at comcast. My supervisor and co leagues are so much fun to work with. The only reason why I leave the company is due to salary disputes that keeps on happening.
good,comcast is a great company with excellent benefits as long as you do you job everything else will follow. The biggest obstacle I face daily is the weather and overcoming the objective of the customer.

good,Comcast has a poor reputation but is working very diligently to improve its reputation and the services it provides. I enjoyed the management I work with at this office.
good,"Working at Consolidated Cable Solutions/Comcast was by far the best job that I have ever landed in my life. I loved how I had my own personal desk every day, I learned how to take payments over the phone as well as process the payment, I would then make sure that it is posted to the account and written in my daily log for that day. I loved how it gave me time with my family as well."
good,"A numbers based organization, but also an organization that cares about employees and makes every day different and exciting. Very fast-paced and high-intensity work environment- much is expected of the employees. However, plenty of time is spent celebrating successes, and there is an amazing work force of people who truly care for one another. I love the people here and feel that it's a great place to work. "

But recently the office is starting to get crowded, and two colleagues need to sit on one table, which is not good. and plus the holiday policy is changing this year which is not good for contractor."
good,"Installation and troubleshooting of services in customers residence may vary by situations. Typically its understanding the customer problem and addressing any questions or concerns they may have. Once you arrive to a customer home you are probably the 1st person from the company they have spoken to face to face in awhile or even the 1st non recording they have experienced so they may be frustrated once you arrive. At this time building a rapport is very important in order to assist the customer in getting the most out of their services. "
good,"I managed  thirteen outbound collectors, including seven virtual collectors and a group of specialized collectors. I support, train, and coach my team members to ensure customer satisfaction and maximum collections on delinquent accounts. I coordinate dialer activities and create operational plans to amplify customer contacts for the collectors to call daily. To guarantee optimal performance of my team I trouble shoot and work internally to resolve all dialer issues. In 2014 the team I supervised met or exceeded their collection goals. I attribute my team’s success and dedication to Comcast due to my ability to foster a positive work environment, consisting of open communication, a climate of mutual respect, and fair and consistent treatment."
good,The role of Comm Tech at Comcast is not your typical nine to five job. Each day is completely different because of the work you do and the people you meet daily.
good,"Comcast maintained a professional work environment yet it allowed employees to enjoy perks such as visits from various networks, actors, and vendors promoting shows and allowing the interaction to become informed on the new  and latest so we can relay it to customers and accurately answer any questions."

good,"I really left the company on 7/22/2015 due to the wok environment , the co workers at that job were very judge mental and they always kept up drama in the work place , that was not the type of place for me , I actually need a stable job and Comcast is definitely not it . The management at that particular location was constantly being switched and we never had an help out on the sales floor when customers needed a manager. The company overall is a great company but that location was horrible."
good,"A typical day at work consists of planning out my day at home, checking out my territory and beginning my day.  I do door to door sales selling television service, high speed internet, home phone service and home security services.  Sometimes my day includes making appointments with customers and following up on those.  I've learned alot about talking to people and i've learned alot about myself   that I can do this kind of sale.  My management and co-workers were very helpful if you needed any advice on closing a sale.  The hardest part of my job was being rejected but moving on to the next opportunity.  The most enjoyable part of my job was conversing with people and helping them out in the best way possible."
good,It is a great company to advance in. good culture. good benefits. only thing that did not enjoy was the hours they didnt work with my school schedule.
good,"I work in the Alpharetta, Georgia call center.  The goals for the position are easily attained so long as you are there to work.  The paid time off equates to around 28 days a year.  The insurance could be better, but it is balanced out by the fact that you EVERY cable option they have including internet and home phone.  The base hourly pay leaves a lot to be desired, but you can pick up extra hours (and are encouraged to do so)."
good,"I enjoyed helping my customers with there problem, and selling cable, internet, and phone services.  I learned the benefits of good customer service.  The company really emphasized this.  They would send trainers to help us become more proficient in customer service, and learn how to deal with all types of customers."
good,"Comcast overall is a great company to work for. Great benefits, profit sharing, re-investments in stock and pay increases. The only thing I disliked was the inconsistent of communication between Tech Ops and Warehouse Reps.I learned a lot working there, working with respectable individuals who want to pursue a common goal and that is to satisfy our customers. Management on the other hand typically Warehouse Management tend to be open-minded about the way Warehouse staff had input in operations, inventory and warehouse organization set-ups etc. The hardest part of the job is keeping everyone one the same page you go some co-workers that want to be the boss and not work as a unit. The enjoyable part is knowing that we are supplying our payment centers with state of the art equipment so the customer reps can help our customers in anyway possible."
good,A great company to work for and grow with.  They have a world of possibilities and you can continue to grow within the orginzation

Typical Days would include assisting customers with service inquires, payments and installations, preparing cash deposits for armored car pick up, promoting sales of product, receiving and shipping inventory (cable boxes, various equipment) as well as supervisor staff.  Overall I learned how to deal with large amounts of cash, how to manage small groups of staff and coach them on how to improve their performance.  I learned how to make sales and set up installations for the services we provided among other things.  The management was easy to work with and encouraging which helped in my advancement in my career path.  The co-workers were also helpful, learning to work as a team to reach a common goal.  The hardest part of my job would be dealing with irate customers although I have learned how to diffuse situations to assist them successfully.

good,"a typical day at work was to assist management with crucial decisions with employees on various topics to include training, discipline, training & development, promotions, work metrics, and leadership development. co-workers were from technical and call center backgrounds.the hardest part of my job was trying to visit all employees on a bi-weekly basis.  the most enjoyable of the job was assisting employees and management on a daily basis."

good,The work environment is great a typical work day consisted of coming to an environment where you wanted to be and wanted to engage in. Everyday we had an adherence to follow by but nothing that wasn't achievable.
good,This job was a great experience. helped me build attention to detail by cleaning and organizing areas. I was in charge of cleaning V.I.P suites and rearranging furniture and replacing toiletries. These rooms had to be  according to the room layout set by stadium owners to best attract  customers. Had to work other co-workers and the success of the job depended on our ability to function as a team. This was also important because of the size of the building and its various areas. in my opinion build time managing skills as well as organization skills.
good,"At Comcast it's a very relaxed setting. Cool people, not too stressful, easy work, and a pool table in the break room. I really enjoy the time that I spend at work."
good,"From writing headlines, pitching enticing sports content daily, or generating original content, this was the best experience a young communications student could have received. This job taught me the importance of timeliness, perfection, and attention to detail."

good,great company to work for. Worst part was some of the filthy homes and vicious pets you'd encounter.
good,This is a very goal orientated company with a friendly and helpful support system and many options for employment and training. I was able to exercise my creativity while serving as a field technician doing installs of the company product. I worked with the customers face to face to solve problems and heighten the understanding of the products offered. The management was more then willing to work with you to achieving career choices and to inform you of there availability. The field technicians that I worked with were quick to help and support each other. The biggest challenge I experienced was to not become personally connected to the customers I installed or corrected problems for. I felt personally responsible for them and their product. I truly enjoyed the approval that the customers express when the job was done. This was amplified when received from the children.
good,"A typical day for me was to be the first to arrive from my department. (RCF) I would get my report ready for the day and take calls until my team members arrived. I did activations for RCF, so I made sure customers were ready for RCF before we activated their phone lines. I had never been in the telecommunications field before, but picked it up rather quickly due to great team members in and out of my department. I enjoyed the fact that most everyone I encountered while employed at Comcast were happy to share their knowledge. When we learned something to help with our jobs we were happy to share with others. ""Knowing is half the battle"" is actually something a co worker sent to me in an email while helping me with a customer. The hardest part of the job to me was when the customer felt we let them down due to lack of communication on our part. The most enjoyable was when everything went great for the customer and they were happy with the services. I loved the potlucks and fund raisers and raffles and always tried to participate. I would definitely work for Comcast again."

good,I would answer inbound calls for customers that would like to update their packages
good,"The work days seem pretty short, due to the amounts of work from the time you walk in to the time you leave that keeps you busy. I learned that my job is important to customers and technician's, being that I supply techs with the appropriate items to get what the customers need done. Management is very up to date with what's going on in the warehouses. They stop by every now and then to make sure everything is in order and to see if they can help out. The hardest part of the job is getting to the job, considering its very far from my house. The job itself is pretty easy to me. The thing I enjoy most about the job, is it has a set schedule so I always know when I work and talking to the other Reps and Technicians."
good,Perks for working with Comcast exceed any employer in the area.
good,"Largest cable company and the very best at delivering service to customers. Never a dull moment, attending after work gatherings was the most fun! Networking opportunities such as luncheons and dinners were very enjoyable as well."
good,"A typical day at this job was assisting business customers with technical support on there phone, internet, and television services. I had some of the best co-workers that I still talk to til this day. I was allowed to advance to a team leader over a project that was appointed to me by the manager of the business department."
good,"Work started as soon as you pull in the area of your store. We look for others stores in the block sales or ad. Monitors the conditions of the parking lots and store. Walk the store for possible concerns that will be address during the day. Meet with management team for information and directions. Conduct meeting in your area with your employees and carry out the agenda. You learn how to manage your own business and how to read profit and loss statement, work with suppliers, Government agency. Our management Team is hand pick by the District Manager two months prior to coming to your store. The hardest part of the jobs is the holiday seasons. You are never off and you see families coming in and enjoying the holiday seasons as a family."
good,Comcast is a great company..  Plenty of overtime and incentives and great benefits
good,"Although the job wasn't perfect with its lack of ability to relay and get the most accurate information to best help the customer, the way Comcast treated its employer I have yet to see match. Work consisted on a daily basis of upset customers wanting to fix issues with their products and services which can leave you mentally exhausted. Managers and co workers were one big family and ready to help in anyway possible. Weekly prizes, giveaways, and food to boost moral and appreciation. Benefits go in effect day of hire and medical after 30 days. The hardest part of this job is also the best which is what i love to do is help others. I would recommend this job to strong will people with a high tolerance and patience to deal with daily tasks."
good,I love the Comcast experience. Wonderful place to workplace with management team members that are enjoyable. I've learn alot about the IT feild since my time with Comcast.
good,A great place to work every day is a learning experience with technology changing at such a fast pace. Always had great relationships with management always very helpful.Most enjoyable part of the job was resolving customers issues and making it both a positive experence for the customer and comcast.

good,Comcast is a Nice fun clean place to work. The people are great. Always a up beat work environment. Management was O.K.
good,"Customer service requires good listening skills, probing the customer, assessng the situation and resolving the problem in minutes. I take billing and repair calls. Customer's who called in about billing you would explain in detail. Customer's who called in about one time issues or repeated problems with their services you try to resolve it over the phone. All co-workers I sit around we all worked together as a team, if a agent is having issues with their networks or system, we normally help each other out when no supervisor's are available to help the agent. The hardest part of the job-you have no control over customers anger and the swearing you have to endure, you show them empathy and a williness to resolve their billing or service issues."
good,"Being a sales representative you has the associate bring customer service and benefits to the everyday customer. I have evolved and been developed at a young age into an exceptional sales associate. I work extremely well with my co-workers or as I like to call them my teammates. When ever someone needs assistance or guidance, i always put my best foot forward in order to help them succeed because that is part of leadership. Management has been nothing but great help to our daily work lives; always developing our product knowledge in order to exceed quota goals and expectations. The hardest part of the job is starting the day off with (0) but I always tell myself that I have a goal to set and exceed every single day i am on the sales floor which is what keeps me going. The most enjoyable part of the job is that i can and will provide benefits to customers on a every day basis that will build great relationships along the way."
good,"Comcast is a great employer to work for. They offer excellent incentives as far as 401K, life insurance, corporate perks, etc. They have a strong family based structure and they hire nothing but the best. you will learn the structure of working as a team, which I truly admire."

good,"A typical day at Comcast consisted of taking numerous inbound calls in regards to cable,internet and telephone service. DailyI would probe for business and handle any other customer issues such as, complaints, billing, tech appointments ect. What I learned is that listening is key in being able to de-escalate a call. I learned to be myself and follow my instinct. Management was good at Comcast because they did not lead by fear. They actually expected mistakes and would listen to the call with you, coach you, and tell you how to fix the mistake as well as tell you your strong points and what to continue doing in your calls. Because I was on a team, communication was important with my co-workers. My co-workers and I would share best practices, on what was working to close sales. We motivated and challenged eachother. The hardest part of the job was the constant change in procedures, and the operating system. The most enjoyable part of the job was closing sales and working with great products and people."

good,"This position is twofold, first manage all of the construction projects for the region, second dig deeper and find answers for questions senior managment hasn't asked yet. Our managment team is excellent and understands the nature of this position. The hardest part of this job is some of the political aspects that come with working for senior level managers (VP's SVP's). For me the best part of the job is being a change agent by identifying areas of opportunity within our processes."

I learned after working there was how to be organized and work at a fast pace daily. The management was always pretty fair unless you were doing something against policy.

good,There's a world of opportunity here that a lot of people don't realize. People who think Comcast is only a cable company fail to see the big picture. Innovation and entrepreneurialism rule the culture.
good,"I didn't get to work at Comcast for very long, and it is mostly my fault. I worked as an Xfinity Sales Associate, which is one of the most difficult jobs they offer. It is door to door sales. While working there, i felt very welcome and at home. The training was very helpful and I could tell that they wanted me to succeed. My job ended with them after a short time because I was having many issues outside of work and they regretfully caused me to stop focusing as much as I needed to at work, causing my unfortunate downfall. I would do just about anything I could do to get a job back with this company."

good,"Enjoyed working here, as everyone is extremely friendly and helpful, and you never know what you're going to run into. Days at work can be extremely stressful and tiring, but other days can be full of excitement and easy. You get a route every morning, leave from home, and end at home. Lunch is pretty consistent unless work backs up. The company is very linient on time off, as they understand life's happens but it still cannot be taken advantage of. All in all, the only cons to this job I have : work days can get long and repetitive. Communication between coworkers over the phone is sometimes spotty when needed."

good,"Huddles are conducted each morning to review performance and address anything necessary for the day or week.  Consistent rotation for greeting and helping customers with an easy Queue system to track who is in the store.  Management and upper management always actively looking for your opinion of workplace, opportunities, as well as customer feedback. Hardest part of the job is getting to know the system and working for a company which does not have the best track record for customer service.  It's hard to work with people who do not like this company, which is often, but it is worth it when you are able to change the perspective of the company with your store and your own customer service."

The sales department was very competitive but management helped to keep it fun and interesting."

I have learned many new things in my time with Comcast and have learned to be open to change .I have experience with Microsoft excel, word, PowerPoint, and access, reports as well as databases used by Comcast. I have taken on self-owned projects for my department ."

From those tickets we get the information on what is happening with the customers LAN and any other issue they are having with their VOIP Phones.

good,Comcast was a fun place to work the building offered a fitness center and a game room where you could go on breaks and get a piece of mind which I feel is much needed for a workplace.
good,Swipe badge to enter the building.  Go on sales floor to log into phone and computer.  Start accepting calls from customers who were interested in home security.  Close the sale and follow up with customers before installation. Management and co-workers were great.  When the company started charging the customers for items that would normally be free was making it hard for a sale to be complete.
good,"Comcast was a very fun place to work.  I was a dispatcher and worked in the office.  The company offered several benefits and incentives for employees and the families.  I learned how to work for a large company with several moving parts.  I also learned about many different computer systems.  Plus memory skills because every installer had a different employee number.  I would have continued my employment, but they moved more than 100 miles away from my home."

good,Comcast is excellent. I love  working for Comcast. Good Benifits and awesome co-workers. And you have fredom and the management is outstanding.
good,A typical day at work is productive I've learned to be more humble working for this company because there are days when you can have some very irate customers that can be very rude and disrespectful but you have to learn how to not take what the customer says to you personal. Management is good I have very helpful co-workers. The hardest part of the job is that it can get stressful and the most enjoyable part of the job they have a lot of activities for us to participate in.
good,A very exciting place to work at. I've grown working in such an enviroment like that one I was in. The most exciting part about the job was meeting very open minded people and discussing what they've learned.

good,Easy going while in a aggressive selling call center atmosphere.  Harness in my data entry and communication skills with the constant outbound calling.

Rebuttals were one of the biggest issues when trying to sell but it was also the most rewarding when able to overcome objections.

good,"This was my first real job even though it was thru a temp agency. The people i worked with were ""lazy"". and I feel i did most of the work. When i expressed this to my supervisor he looked into it and actually did something about it, assigning daily duties. I learned to speak up for myself and to be a team player here."
good,I really enjoyed working with this company.  there were constant changes but they were given well enough notice so employees could adapt.  Not only where they about their customers but they were about their employees.  I really hated to leave but i kept getting passed over and felt it was time to move on.
good,"Great place to work fast paced environment.  Call centers open 24/7, learned to multitask to meet the needs of the internal and external customers."
good,"Something new every day..no office to sit in all day and management was great."

good,This place offered a great environment and options to move up the ladder very easily! The free service couldn't be topped! Managers and Supervisors were the best!!!
good,"I learned that no matter what the situation may be the customer is always right! customer service is a must and it is an important part of everyday life. the people were a pleasure to work with and it was a fun fast paced place to work! great benefits, the hardest part would be that it is a 24 hour call center, the shifts could vary and it seniority always wins"

good,A typical day at Comcast can be pretty hectic. Comcast is so successful because they are very strict when it comes to the schedule you have to stick to and what they expect of you.

good,"Company promises to be amenable to supplying advancement opportunity. Unless it is within the current role there is no chance of advancement. The culture is not friendly. Management is very wishy-washy. Best part of the job is having your own vehicle and working alone. Working alone can also be the hardest part of the job, along with climbing telephone poles, tight attics, dirty and disgusting crawl spaces to only have a customer make a complaint after all the hard work to ultimately damage your chances of a raise or recognition."

good,inbound call center where you assisted caller with issues on their equipment and/or services. also the hardest part to me was trying to explain how to fix a issue with ones who were not understanding-examples like pairing a remote or getting their TV back running when they have pushed the wrong button or it has a error code on their screen and they were unwilling to assist or get up to unplug and/or follow my steps in that case we send technicians and schedule them to come int heir home

However, the thing is in the orientation, job placement, interview, to the job app, the key word was show up. Majority of people get fired from Comcast and it isn't for a lack of job performance, or outlandish behavior, it is strictly because people don't show up to do the work. Now working there a year+ I have received a $2.94 raise of market analysis competitive pricing, performance review, and annual raises with another up to 6.0% raise in income. Comcast gives management opportunities to literally ANYONE. A well invested employee returns high yields on ROI, and ROA."

good,"Great benefits and career opportunities, great co-workers.  Helping customers in a retail store environment, completing sales for household technology such as cable, internet and home security."
good,"Comcast is customer orientated, technicians are well trained before entering the field. Comcast has a excellent management team who give substantial support to their technicians."
good,Comcast was a great place to work I really enjoyed my time with the company. I was really disappointed when they dissolved my department but they did look out for the the employees by offering a package I enjoyed the experience.
good,Comcast is a great company to work for. They have great benefits. I don't recommend technical support. The metrics are stressful within that position. You deal with angry customers all day. Management is on you about sales when customers are already upset that their service isn't working. If they'd remove sales from the technical service positions the turn over rate for those positions would go down.

good,This is an office job at a call center. I show up to work at the same time every morning. I log into a computer and sign on with an employee id. I read and respond to emails. I answer incoming telephone calls from the general public and ask questions strategically aimed at gaining control of the conversation and selling Comcast products to customers. I never really had a true sales job before working here. In fact my original position only involved answering customers' questions about their bills. Since we were converted to sales I have had the opportunity to learn many great sales techniques that have allowed me to be better than I ever realized I could be in the sales profession. Management is very supportive and work hard at maintaining a positive environment. I have come to understand after talking with many fellow employees that other sales environments can be just the opposite. Sometimes it can be tough to keep up with the sheer number of calls and maintain good talk times but it is always exciting to take that next call and try and  take advantage of the opportunities it presents.
good,I really enjoyed working at Comcast. My co workers where always friendly and management was also very understanding. I would recommend this job to all my piers.

I come to work get everything set up for the day. I am ready to start my job at 9:30 am helping customers with disputes about their bills, help with troubleshooting their equipment issues.

I enjoyed working at Comcast because the team of managers believed in me and helped me get promoted every time I applied for a new department."
good,My typical work day was 8-5 Tuesday though Saturday. This is where I first learned how to work in the cable industry. Management for the most part was extremely professional.

Management is doing a great job keeping the employees happy and engaged with different activities ( raffles with 4k tvs, lunch, incentives) , it’s a friendly work environment. Everybody is so helpful it’s like a big family. But if you’re considering a position in sales you got to know what you are signing up for and ask yourself if it’s the right fit for you. You gotta hustle, be strategic and aggressive. Most importantly, do not take anything personal, a lot of customers have the wrong idea about the company ( services provided, prices, customer service) and get on your line ready to curse you out without giving you a chance to tell them how you can and will help them with their issue. It was really stressful for me to the point i was afraid to take the next call. There are opportunities to grow within the company, God just had other plans for me. But if you’re considering a career at Comcast, I’ll say go for it. Just make sure you get a position that will suit you."

good,"Comcast is a leading telecommunications company and is committed to upholding a leadership position in this industry, and although it's always easy to blame those tasked with providing the leadership role in any particular sector, for their supposed shortfalls, rather than what is in-fact exceptional about the caliber of leadership they provide. As a result I often perceived people to undermine what our added value which we could offer happened to be in relation to how much better we could deliver a guaranteed level of quality, this of course, while tasked with representing the company during my time employed as a sales representative, and having to resolve many issues one on one with Comcast customers. Even considering all this, I still could perceive that more often than not, people tend to appreciate all the rewards and benefits which are only made possible by forging an alliance with the leading company in this case, rather than trusting whatever alternative there happened to be. Therefore I am thankful to have had the opportunity to work with Comcast, since I believe that working with those who provide leadership, is always a building experience, and always worthwhile."

If theirs a problem I have the managers are good at handling it and we are given several tools on handling the problem.
