bad,Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.
bad,Ball has people in high place that have no idea what they are doing! they shut a plant down and open another up about 1 and hlf hours away. were they have to sub out about 60% of there work because they do not have the skilled employees!
bad,"A horrible place where shouting, cursing, and name calling is the norm! "
bad,Great benefits! Excellent pay! Very routine jobs. I made a living there until they closed our plant and moved production out of USA.
bad,"Hard working people have to work harder because management does not do its job to make sure that all co-workers do there jobs. Work life balance does not happen here they don't hire enough people for the job so there is over time all the time. union work that pretty much lets the company do what it likes."
bad,"Pays well.  You are just a number, no one cares about you. I kept machine running, and reared it when it broke.  I gave operators breaks."
good,Everybody was so nice and helpful! Enjoyed working with all the different people and backgrounds. Management was not easy to work with at times but overall enjoyed the work.
good,"Trabalhar na empresa foi uma experiencia muito boa ,pois conseguia me comunicar com todos ,sabia fazer meu servico muito bem,em fim aprendi a me comunicar com as pessoas melhor."
good,Ball Aerosol was a great place to work they had great benefits and options for retirement.  I was paid good and their was plenty of overtime offered and made some life long friends.
good,This company provides its employee's with a casual and relaxed work environment. I was an intern for this company for 9 months and during that time I held two different positions. I enjoyed my time with this company and I learned a moderate amount while working there
good,Would still be working there if they had not closed our plant.
good,"Was really excited about working for Ball when our plant was purchased. Loved my job until Oct. 2011, when they announced lay-offs and lines shutting down. Nobody knows if our plant will stay open or close. Moral is very low. Loosing, and have lost good employees, good people, and close friends/co-workers."
good,"Training is a bit lax.  Shadow for a few weeks, read a book, take the tests, don't screw up.  Co-workers are quick to throw people under the bus to avoid consequences or pass blame.  Shift managers often make bad calls that trickle down in blame and disciplinary action for the process tech if they catch heat.  Do your job and do not get sucked into the nonsense and bad habits of your co-workers."
good,"Empresa muito boa, porem sem muitas oportunidades de crescimento profissional"
good,It was a good place to work . The people where difficult to get to know . Was managed well when I started but had a change of management .After that it went down hill . The constant bickering between union & management was the worse part of job. I feel like I made some lifelong friends at work.
good,great coworkers and chance to learn alot. Large company with many divisions. Management needs to be a little more aware of employees knowledge and understand they can benefit from this.
good,"After starting ball i enjoyed the hours and how they would flip on four days off four days. Main disappointment would be management. I currently got injured and contacted Ball and Manpower to inform them I wouldn't make it in for a few day's, nobody would call me back."
good,Great people on the production floor to work around. Co-workers became a family due to long hours and working holidays
good,"Buena empresa con buen clima de trabajo. Prestan atención al trabajador con atenciones como capacitaciones mensuales, desayunos y actividades en equipo."
good,"12 hour shifts, switch monthly between day and night. If you adapt easily to overnight graveyard shifts and like an active work environment, it's a great job. Downsides are the continuous shift swings, a loud, hot environment, and long hours.Upside is good pay and good culture of teamwork."
good,Muy buena empresa pago justo sin retrasos mala administración exigencias por cubrir gente para no pagar tiempo extra
good,"great people and testing  and a interesting job, management  could have been better I think partly why it closed.the co workers were like family and greatly missed"
good,"I like working for a company that cares about there employees."
good,An excellent opportunity to acquire in-depth knowledge related to container manufacturing. Though recent actions have left some positions with less stability. I'm satisfied with my overall employment with this Company.
good,"An enjoyable position in workers' compensation, personal injury and mediation, with exciting absorption of procedures and laws to include same."
good,"I always knew when going into work that the challenges awaited me. I further knew that I could manage it, adapt to it and have a productive day without fail. Sometimes, a co-worker would drag me down and make me sad, due to them having a bad shift before me. I always did my best to lift the spirits of any and all, by injecting a little humor and speaking about it all. I listened a great deal while people vented. Good therapy for the work environment, as well as for me, while trying to make a positive difference."
good,It was a good company to work for. good people. Management treated you equally and fairly and it was good Pay too. Also worked with your schedule and had opportunities to work plenty of overtime.
good,"ambiente laboral muy bueno y mis compañeros sos personal geniales,teníamos unas llaves para sacar de las maquinal café y galletitas"
good,Most days where very busy. I learned the importance of making a good quality product for our costumers. My co-workers had become like family to me. The hardest part of the job was the heat in the plant. I love working in a fast pace company.
good,"Great Benefits, Good People, Ball is getting too big for current staffing levels at corporate requiring extremely high stress levels for current employees. Plants don't get the support they need."
good,The hardest part of my job was the heat. Co-Workers were friendly. I learned alot about different coats for aluminum sheets. Managers are very understanding.
good,"Empresa excelente para trabalhar onde temos bons profissionais, ambiente convidativo par sequencia de carreira, horario bastante interessante pois nos dá a condição de viagens e ficar mais tempo junto a familia."
good,"Hectic and challenging, but rewarding. My job consisted of final inspection of product before shipping to customer. I learned to multi-task and enjoyed working with other people who cared about our product. The hardest part of the job for me was working swing shifts and the most enjoyable part was working in quality."
good,"Formerly know as Metal Container, Ball Corporation, is a manufacturing facility of aluminum cans. My employment spanned over 15 years. I am very familiar and have taken continuing education classes certifying me to perform maintenance and skills needed to operate all the machinery in the facility."

good,"Excellent place to work. Great co-workers and management. Always had work to do. Very clean, well lit shop. Everyone was a pleasure to work with. Hate the plant closed."
good,"A normal work day is about 10 hours long, fast paced and challenging. I have been able to grow from a shift lead to a production supervisor , to a production manager. I feel I have built a great team that can accomplish ant challenge to comes up. The hardest part of the job is juggling all the schedule changes to meet our customer demands. One of the most exciting things I enjoy is the challenge of completing the job, hitting our goals."
