rating,review
bad,"Very dull environment to work, no room for progress. Atmosphere is very negative filled with awkwardness. Management team come to work and hope for the best.. No skills or professionalism which led many staff members to quit. Would never recommend."
bad,Unfortunately Fossil has taken a significant turn for the worse and is in significant decline.  In addition their leadership is significantly challenged to make basic decisions to improve the business and move the company forward.  Don't waste your time.
bad,"The company does not really advance within, and if they do you have to fit into their ""brand"".  It's really not about what you know or how hard you work in order to advance; It's about who you know and who likes you.  "
bad,"This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. The manager constantly would gossip about others and as a result almost the entire team (including management) had to leave. I contacted HR about these issues and nothing was addressed or resolved. As a retail manager myself for the past 10 years I was extremely disappointed with the lack of judgment, professionalism and understanding from not only the store manager, but the company as a whole. I would never recommend working for the Fossil store at Cherry Creek in Denver, at least under the current management."
bad,"Pésimo trato humano, condiciones laborales muy justas, experiencia muy negativa, de las peores empresas que he conocido."
bad,"I loved the product at the store I worked at, but my manager consistently kept breaking the rules by coming in 3-5 hours late for her shifts everyday. When I reported her to HR it was only two weeks before I was let go without reason except for it was in my three months and they legally are allowed to."
bad,The team I worked with was great spent a long time with this company but management just turned the place into a wrestling match. Management is terrible. Job security is 100% won't get fired won't get laid off cause they can't find anyone to work for them.
bad,This place is a waste of time and I would not recommend to someone looking for growth or a career advancement.  It's only for those looking for a part time gig or just for fun other than that its not a good place to work. The management especially is horrible and demand alot from you.
bad,"Bad managers tended to stress out employees and create drama. They tended to feed into rumors and did not mind making employees cry. They would turn an hour break into a two hour break and they would never help the employee with cleaning the store or garbage duty. They made me do double trips to the garbage outside in 20 degree weather instead of doing what other stores do and go together. The hours was based on favoritism. You are told you get more if you sell more but, I sold more than the managers and got the least amount of hours than all of the associates. I was treated with less care because a manager was jealous because I got close to a manager she disliked. All in all... avoid the job."
bad,"company constantly wanted your ideas for how to change business but never does anything. "
bad,"A typical day at Fossil was trying to make it on time because they take being on time very seriously yet there no grace time, and its not easy getting there when the Highway is right in front. At Fossil i learned that the customer will always be right even if they aren't, aside from that I did get more knowledge with their SAP system. Management is blah, they all seem stuck up. The culture at Fossil is very fun, for the most part everyone is nice but there is a high fashion demand upon everyone, you always feel like you must fit in and that is stressing. The hardest part about my job was the amount of hrs and only having a 30 min lunch with mandatory overtime during the holidays."
bad,"Sent all IT work offshore and within a year bringing back onshore. Management was not good.  Culture was okay, laid back atmosphere but IT department in the basement very depressing"
bad,"Fossil used to be a fabulous company and was unique. With the addition of new Sr.  management over the past few years, it's not the same place. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. The hardest is not knowing if you will have a job or not in a few years. There is a great deal of uncertainity and feeling all over the organization."
bad,The company lacks a clear direction.  My direct leader was not supportive. Company cares more about the customer than the employees. Undue pressure to influence Google reviews and to keep the customer from complaining.
bad,Es una empresa donde no puedes tener un plan de vida debido a que no hay tanta estabilidad laboral y en cualquier momento pueden dejarte sin empleo.
bad,Aucunes reconnaissances au niveau du travail par le manager
bad,Fossil has great intangible benefits but compensation and job advancement is lacking. Lots of layoffsvas they are behind the curve in keeping up with technology.
bad,"Excellent co-workers, best part of the job!"
good,Compensation is terrible and the management culture is less than desirable.
good,"A great place for work to life balance, great people and a great culture. Fun atmosphere, great discounts but not a lot of growth to move up in the company."
good,Don't look for this to be place to grow where u start is where you stay. I have a great manager and the job is fun. If you are just looking for a solid job this is the place
good,"The rest of Fossil Corporate does not seem too shabby, but customer care is not a great place to be. I do understand that it is entry level and that they have to be pretty strict on pretty much everything, but pretty much no one in management there is genuine. One of Fossil’s main tag lines is, “welcome home” when you are first hired, and it did feel like home going through the hiring process and training, but the moment I was on my own and confined to the lower level, things changed. Management will make you feel as if you are doing everything perfectly and the next day, you won’t have a job. I feel like I was walking on eggshells everyday going into Fossil’s customer care department. 10/10 would not recommend."
good,"Worked as a CSR at the corporate office seasonally. It is very unorganized and they literally cut majority of the seasonal people the day they were leaving with no warning. They told us they would start letting people go after 1/20 and called us in on 1/6 to fire us about five minutes before closing. The supervisors are never available when you need them, they claim to be so helpful but are not, and they obviously show favoritism as they kept a few people longer than the bulk of seasonal people even though they didn't really know what they were doing. They throw a lot of potlucks and feed you so that's cool and the other CSR's are really nice and helpful."
good,"It is a very high-end brand that was established in Texas, US. "
good,Een heel varierende job waardoor het wel boeiend blijft.
good,"Fossil is a great company, great culture with great work life balance. All positive the only negative, there is no career growth or advancement. Have to be in a position for 10+ to become a manager or director."
good,"All in all, I enjoyed my two years at Fossil; however, once we changed over with a new district manager, everything began going downhill. The growth they promise is rarely delivered on and they don't hire 'from within' like they like to boast. It's also hard to get any job at the corporate level because your district manager has to sign off and approve even though the position you're applying for has nothing to do with a store or customers. I loved my coworkers and they made each and every day bearable. They made coming into a tough work environment fun and easy, but the higher management is where the issues come from. They lack empathy and care and are willing to let you go to find the next best thing (that they can also pay way less than you). The things we sell are amazing and the product really does speak for itself. Quality each and every time. If only Fossil spent a little more quality time with their employees and asked them what was working and what wasn't."
good,If you're not doing exactly how they want you to do it they may or may not let you know. Also are not open to conversation about me ways to do things.
good,This brand makes great quality products that most customers love. Working here is very simplistic. Upper management is constantly restructuring and turning. The product is available in so many locations that the retail locations struggle to hit goals or incentives.
good,24/7 on call for facilities management for 300 Fosill retail stores and 350 Shop in Shop locations.  Extremely busy with limited help.
good,"Fossil is een bedrijf waar geen enkele dag hetzelfde is, erg gebeurt heel veel en zeker de laatste jaren zijn er veel ontwikkelingen geweest op organisatorisch- en productniveau. In mijn functie heb ik veel vrijheid en bepaal ik grotendeels mijn eigen agenda, maar toch heb ik het gevoel dat ik in een team werk waarbij ik veel contact heb met collega's op kantoor. De lijnen zijn kort en duidelijk en dat maakt het erg overzichtelijk, maar daarmee zijn ook de doorgroeimogelijkheden vrij beperkt. Het moeilijkste van deze baan is de sterk veranderende maatschappij en het daarop in moeten spelen en het leukste is het klantcontact, de adviserende rol en de tevreden klanten."
good,Pay isn’t great and neither is job security. Fossil hasn’t been doing so well the last few years so they have had major layoffs in the process. Which is a real shame.
good,"You're taking about 95 or so calls a day. Some are really simple, others are stressful because the customer is angry and wants only what they want, nothing less, nothing more. Those calls also might last up to an hour or so. It's basically filled with consistently talking to customers on the phone all day non stop, with a lot of negativity. If that's something that's no big deal to you than you're definitely fit for this position. If a lot of negativity weighs on you, then you should probably look elsewhere."
good,"Typical day at work: cashier, work in our personal goal (sales), a lot of costumer service, organizing the store."
good,Very good company to work for  if you are to looking to grow with a company very fast. Staff and members was great. I head that the office is going to relocating
good,"Great place to build skills and experience. I really enjoy the job, however I would not reccomend the company for others looking for a career in retail."
good,"Worked as a selling specialist selling hand bags in the Macy store working as a vendor."
good,This company works well for people who are trying to advance there careers within retail. I only recommend for store and field employees to stay no longer than 3 years. As this company grows advancement is not promoted internally. This company hires externally to help there chain growth advancement.
good,This was a good job but not many opportunities for me. Management and employees were nice.
good,"Working for Fossil is a good way for someone right out of high school to get started. The pay was decent for someone young but not enough for someone trying to live on their own. "
good,"I was always greeted by smiles from my employees when I came to work, and was able to learn a lot and hone in on my selling skills here. The management was great here and I really liked the culture."
good,The people are the best part and really have fun together while getting the job done. Great products with outstanding quality for a competitive price. Updating and publishing process will help the teams maintain momentum in this tough retail environment.
good,I enjoyed working here becuase of the employees but the idea of meeting a sales goal was uncomfortable for me because I was inexperienced and found it harder to sale items.
good,"Good Company to work for if you want a full time position where your sole focus is work. Great benefits, harsh procedures regarding sickness but over all good company."
good,"Worked in shoppers stop under the banner of Fossil group and gained fantastic experience about the watch industry , which was creatively routed in authentic and classic design."
good,"• Developing staff to a higher professional level by modeling the way and setting company’s proper standards of professional behaviors on the sales floor and customer service, thus ensuring that store is aligned with company’s core values and that the staff are brand ambassadors to the customer.  "
good,"definitely, recommend working for fossil. it is very slow paced, rewarding and pays well. The management is extremely professional and does well. They work well with your schedule."
good,"nice place with good team,learned new things, everyday is a "
good,"It's fun to work in the retail business, but the business of retail is an up and down business.  If the business is booming, you get lots of hours, if it's slow, you get little hours to work."
good,"on m'a promis pleins de choses lors de l'embauche sur mon avenir , rien ne sait produit."
good,"Good discount "
good,"I absolutely love my job with the Fossil Group, however, it is an extremely tight knit community to break into for advancement. It is a who knows who basis and how willing one is to “suck up”. Also their policies are very well written yet very rarely followed due to their “obsess over the guest” ideology. We are told to do absolutely anything to make our customers happy even if we must break a policy."
good,"I love the company and what it stands for. We actually receive Volunteer Time Off hours to use rather than our regular PTO for giving back opportunities."
good,"Fossil was an great place to work, lots of great people and the culture was always great. Compensation was not the best, but they had a few perks that balanced it out a little. Management was not always on par, but over all its a good place to work."
good,The company has many great perks for the employees. At times more is focused on the culture rather than actual innovation that can lead the company to prosper.
good,Its a great place for a part time job or move to management. The people are nice and the company really backs a very human aspect of retail. I learned how to interact with different costumers on a more personal level because of what this company stands for. The amazing style/vibe of the store is refreshing
good,Fossil was a fun place to work. They would take time for team building activities and had a flexible work schedule between 7:00 am to 6:00 pm that was supposed to encourage a work/life balance with no overtime.
good,"I worked as a Shop in Shop Manager Full Time. Management was great - supportive and available. Great benefits and paid vacations. Employee discount was great especially when using the deep discount one time a month."
good,"A great company that really cares about its employees and treats them very well. Although the hours are sometimes strange, the benefits certainly make up for it"
good,"Fossil overall is a good place to work, however it is operated in small company manner.  There is no career advancement for most folks."
good,"Working for Fossil assesories is very challenging... You get to meet new people everyday and the work environment is very good"
good,Heel mooi bedrijf met hele mooie merken en producten.
good,"Man ist für ca. 7 Marken zuständig und dass dann für Uhren und Schmuck. Dadurch dass man meistens alleine auf der Fläche war, hatte man immer was zutun."
good,There are lots of friendly and talented resources at Fossil. I enjoy the work culture and environment.  I do not enjoy the uncertainty of our industry.
good,No comment. Join their Company if you want to know more.
good,"I was a Key Holder at Fossil. I loved the culture and workplace. However, I was being paid for a Key Holder job when I was basically working as an Assistant Manager. I was in charge of associates, worked forty hours occasionally (though I was part time), and have weekly conference calls and sales analysis work I had to keep track of. I would recommend Fossil as a fun sales job for associates who don't want to work in retail for the long run."
good,"I learned about inventory management, analyzing turn and sale through, gross margin, and making adjustments to the orders and re-orders to increase profitability. My typical day would consist of talking to the buyers about orders, the buys, suggested markdowns, etc. and working with the merchandising and marketing teams at Fossil to ensure our product assortment and all marketing materials meet the wholesale account's needs. I enjoyed analyzing the business, talking about opportunity and how to increase profitability."
good,"Fossil group is a great company to work for if you get a chance.with a great work life balance , very big on giving back , and all about team building ."
good,"Fair work culture and good home life work balance. Good teachings from higher ups. Not the best pto program. However, everything else was great. Alot of time spent with consumers which I greatly enjoy! Smartwacthes are very cool and the company has a great progression plan on staying with the consumer trends."
good,"Great values and culture. Good compensation, lots of great incentives. Sales expectations can be difficult to meet due to the high volume of customers coming in with warranty repairs, troubleshooting needs and battery replacements in watches"
good,"Fossil was a great place to get my career started. I learned much about wearable technology, systems engineering, and manufacturing. "
good,"Overall great company to work for, however they have struggled with a tough market environment and have had to make a lot of internal changes to become smaller and more profitable. Great company culture and campus and a great place to work if you are just starting you career."
good,It's a fun place to work.  I was given many opportunities to learn new skills and branch out.  The building is great and the culture is lively and exciting.
good,"Fijn magagement, wordt veel rekening gehouden met werk en prive. "
good,"Fossil was a relaxed environment that promoted a creative and productive environment. My supervisor allowed freedom to organize our work however we needed, as long as we meet certain deadlines. She was always open to hearing concerns and ideas."
good,Typical day consisted of helping out clients pick out their watches and making sure every part of the store is looking up to company standards. In the mornings when you come in you are responsible for cleaning and making sure everything is filled for the day to come.
good,"Amazing place, a lil bit rush on sometimes but amazing team.Every day is a amazing experience, the company sent trainigs thats helps to be a good manager. Etc"
good,I learned many systems however it was very hard to feel appreciated from outside departments. Management tries their best to keep morale high with potlucks and customer service appreciation week. I enjoyed spending time with my coworkers because most everyone is extremely nice however as stated before advancement into another role is a bit difficult.
good,"during the holiday season, it is crazy the hours are really long due to universals extended hours so keep that in mind. after the holiday seasons, it is dead like maybe only 10-20 customers during your shift.  There's a lot of pressure to sell since the only way to get more hours is to sell more they have competitive hours, no commission at all. there is a great discount on all merchandise with 2 deep discounts a month."
good,"Great Company to work for with great benefits and compensation. Flexible Schedule. Not too fast paced, big focus on selling and customer service."
good,Great company to get great management experience while maintaing a work life balance. i enjoyed moving up quickly while learning from great peers and mentors.
good,"As a company which has seen huge growth in previous years, Fossil continues to have a family feel, while still operating at a corporate level."
good,"Varied hours throughout the week"
good,it was awesome because Fossil management gave us the tools to actually help our customers and gain their loyalty in the process. We were graded pretty heavily and often but our managers wanted quality over quantity when it comes to calls.
good,"Quite honestly one of the greatest companies I work for, they are very attentive to the needs of the employees and are always striving to strengthen sales teams to ensure everyone I working efficiently."
good,Fossil isn't a bad place to work. It's not the place you want to work if you want to make money or move up. Pay is low and hours are not guaranteed. Usually gets slow from January until around August and hours are cut.
good,great place to work. Being out there in the field getting to work with great minds. Very flexible schedule if your looking to balance school and work
good,"The management at Fossil make the job very enjoyable and a pleasure to work there. "
good,"Desde que llegas, hasta que sales, la gente se porta muy amable , son muy considerados  y algo importante ofrecen mucho crecimiento.  te desarrollan como persona y profesionalmente."
good,"As a sales associated I felt valued and was respected. I worked there for three years and loved my time there. I interacted with other sales associates, managers and customers."
good,"It was an fruitful experience. I learned a lot, grew a lot. And now I am at a different point in my life. I will remember my time there for a very long time"
good,Fossil group is a great company to work for. They are big on couching and development and building the team from the ground up. There main focus is the guest that come in to shop to radical customer experience is KEY!
good,Working for Fossil you always know where the Guest stand.  As a company we go out of the way to make our Guest happy.  Since working with Fossil I have grown both as a manger and as a leader.  My favorite part of being in retail is the fact that I get to be that devil/angel on the shoulder that is there to help you make a great purchase.
good,"I like very much Fossil group and Watches."
good,A typical day at Fossil consisted of catering to customers wants and needs based off product knowledge to offer the best fit. When it became slow that time was utilized to merchandise product displays or tend to other projects. Management was very attentive and helpful with any and everything. The hardest part was seeing customers leave without purchasing anything due to price preference. The most enjoyable part was collaborating with colleagues to meet goals as well as delivering satisfaction to customers through our service.
good,This job is amazing ! I was lucky to work with great managers who are very helpful and they teach you things in a great manner. The only hard part about working with Fossil is just trying to make LY.
good,"Enjoyable"
good,Maryhurst is a rewarding place to work. However when you work with traumatized children it can be stressful and you need to take some time for yourself. Co-workers are wonderful and always respectful of each other
good,Fossil has a great company culture and a good work/life balance - hard to advance due to layoffs and pay is sub par. Need to know all about excel and how to use more than basic functions.
good,"I greatly enjoy working for Fossil. Great teams, management, and workplace environment. Teaches you lots of invaluable skills about sales and self-development. Very authentic brand."
good,"Focused on strategy, employs top line experts in the industry. Branding and storytelling are at the heart of this company and they are very good at it."
good,"Fue una experiencia fantastica a cargo de 2 mercados y trabajando en puntos de venta y haciendo home office."
good,"This job had flexible work hours.  I worked for internal reporting then, and had an excellent manager.  The only time that overtime was required was at month end.  Very friendly atmosphere and a great place to work."
good,good company. They have great perks and discounts on all of their brands. The company is fun and the atmosphere is very modern.
good,This job has taught me so much in retail and management. It was a little difficult at first becoming a store manager but soon became easy and second nature to me.
good,"The work culture for Fossil group is  just amazing. While, the emphasis is always on getting the job done, it has never come at the cost of a great work-life balance. Overall, I had a great and positive experience with Fossil group."
good,"Busy all the time running around performing different tasks, like answering phones relating messages dispensing mail and other packages. Sending outgoing packages to other countries. Entering new orders. Making sure office was clean and in order."
good,Dont work crazy overtime like some companies. Very nicely balanced. Job advancement is only available if in an area with lots of stores (not MN). Benefits are typical of most retailers.
good,"Buen equipo de trabajo y buena colaboración por parte de todos. He aprendido sobre un sector que desconocía, de manera rápida y sencilla, sin descuidar detalles."
good,"It was an amazing school for the Fashion Watch and accessories industry. "
good,"Bei Fossil herrscht eine sehr angenehme und familiäre Atmosphäre, in der man sich sehr wohlfühlt. Man wird schnell ins Team integriert und lernt schnell, was man wie zu tun hat. "
good,A typical day at work would consist of helping the customer find what best fits their needs. You would first engage in a personal level and then try to best assist the customer. Very sales driven environment.
good,I loved the team and management. Great product. The culture makes for team work and a happy place to work. The management kept things fun and upbeat while having us still work hard.
good,Everyone works together as a team and advancement opportunities are available. I would go back in a heartbeat if they had an opening. They were flexible with our schedule to give us the best work/family balance.
good,Overall a great company to work for. Good work life balance. Good advancement for growth. Coworkers are easy to work with and managers are encouraging and helpful in career growth.
good,"It was a pleasure working at Fossil.  Great management team, product and culture.  The Brand, Sales and Finance organization are top notch.  It was a great experience working there."
good,I have been working just part time in Vancouver and so far It's awesome. The manager and in general your co workers are very friendly and collaborative.
good,"I loved working here. Never hated coming to work, unless it was like someone's birthday I was missing of course, but even then the day went by quick and management had me in a relaxed mood. I wish they paid more of course. If they paid like $15/hr or more for a full -time position, I would definitely go back to work at Fossil. For a part-time job in Kansas,  while being in college or school, this job is flexible as long as you advise ahead of time."
good,I loved my job at the Fossil Group.  The people were great to work with and I have made lifetime friends there.  The products we represented were also amazing something to be proud to be a part of the company.
good,Very good place to work at. Absolutely amazing management as well as crazy worker discounts which include 50% and 70% twice a month. People are encouraging as well.
good,Working for fossil corporate was amazing. They taught me a lot about answering phone calls handling customers and also jewelry and watches. I never knew anything about watches until I work there it was pretty tough to learn some of the steps but if you're willing to learn and you're a fast learner you'll get the job easily.
good,The best thing about Fossil is that people treat you as family. They work with you schedule and want you to succeed in life. Management is great and they make sure everything is working in your life style.
good,"Profesionalidad y ambiente acogedor."
good,"Amazing company not only with the management but also with the everyone from the top to the bottom. Nothing bad to say, just a great place to work. Everyone helps you in any way then can which is a wonderful feeling."

good,"Great culture and great environment.  A fun, creative place to work.  Fast paced and dynamic.  Fossil has helped me grow my career for which I am most grateful."
good,"Managers take time to know you, it is a family. They take time to know you at work and off work. People keep in touch and they are not just a coworker, they are your friend. They help you with challenges and help you succeed in your workplace."
good,"I have been with Fossil Group for over four years now, and never in my life have I been more grateful for a group of people. My team is a unique blend of some of the most genuine individuals I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. The atmosphere in the store is a direct reflection of our leadership, and I am very proud to be a part of such a warm, caring, and tolerant organization."
