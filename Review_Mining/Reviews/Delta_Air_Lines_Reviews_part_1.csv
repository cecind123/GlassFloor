bad,Don’t waste your time. HR is a joke and the pay and benefits are the worst. They don’t care about their employees and just want to make money. The hours are long
bad,"low opportunity to move up,  workplace is toxic, by definition, it is unhealthy and damaging to those who work there. Individuals who work in toxic work environments begin to see problems with their own personal health. This can include physical symptoms such as not being able to sleep, gaining weight, and having increased medical problems."
bad,The delta worker harrassed us from doing our job they don't respect employers they don't pay enough money and they fly in bad weather I don't know why the company can't respect people
bad,we haven't get any raised the hourly rate after work long months and 14.00 is not enough for us to work in the warehouse because we worked so hard and short lunch break. Our management is not good too. They haven't do anything what we asked for. We learned nothing just same things everyday.
bad,Delta did not pay my on the job accident caused by my supervisor.  The manager never submitted paperwork and this caused by credit score to to reflect their negligence.
bad,"Management doesn’t care for balance between life, family and work! If you’re not all in for Delta, they will find a way to get rid of you! "
bad,Nothing positive about this place. Stay  away don't expect anything from this company. You are on your way to a no where job hopeless work with zero gratitude.
bad,"If you want to work for Delta , be prepared to become a slave . "
bad,No treat people like slaves. Move on save the BS. if you don't move up in the first few months you will never get a promotion. The flight benefits end up being a nightmare.
bad,Poorly managed.  Trained on web based system and then when you get down on floor told to use old system it's faster...mixed messages from older agents
bad,"Also ways be as fake as possible at the interviews, I faked smiled until my cheeks started twitching. iDuring training instructors definitely pick their favorites. During your first 90 days known as ""Fly Right"" don't even attempt to call out sick with even the flu as you will still be written up. Be prepared to consistently work 4am, 5am, 6am sign-ins."
bad,"Take this job at your own risk. "
bad,They dont care about employees . Only care for flights cargo passengers arrivals and departures . Plenty of favoritism . Blame workers for everything if something small may take place
bad,Terrible working place to work in. many heath risks and chemical exposure at delta. Management has poor peoples skills and create very toxic environment.
bad,"Not family oriented , racist , management is horrible, pay is horrible, jobs are stressful and they do not care about family. This company is very racist and closed minded especially their call center"
bad,Ga er niet werken en wacht tot er iets fatsoenlijks komt
bad,"If you want to be treated badly paid poorly and treated like you are a number and not a person then Delta is for you."
bad,do not work here it is a terrible company they do not care about their employees. no sick policy. company only cares about money. they work you to death and tell you they take care of you. but you are overworked and underpaid
bad,"Delta Airlines Global Services stresses safety but expects the minimum crew to offload 250+ and deliver them to customers in 20 minutes or less. "
bad,"I learned how to quickly and efficiently make travel reservations for guest who were sometimes demanding, in a professional way. I also learned the different codes to the airlines which has come in hand."
bad,"I was unfairly arrested and terminated for theft which did not occur."
bad,They have multiple work forces that do the exact same work for different pay.  The pay & benefits for the subsidiaries are less that half that of the mainline counterparts.  This is an unfair work practice that needs to stop!!!!  The same work deserves the same pay and benefits.
bad,"not able to say anything because it is not good "
bad,Horrible place to work I would not recommend anybody to work there. The station manger didn't know anything about the job and still got hired over people who had more experience.
bad,No advancements unless you know someone within the company that’s higher up. Flight benefits aren’t worth it.  Very strenuous. Lack of sympathy for employees. Everyone Ima replaceable.
bad,"There is no appreciation on whatsoever you give or contribute to the company, they just want to take work out of you."
bad,"I would never recommend this job to anyone.  Terrible work life balance with terrible management. I've been with the company almost 10 years now (trying to leave) and things are getting worse. They change pay levels on a whim, profit sharing on a whim, and give their employees the bare minimum.  Their medical benefits are awful. Forget about retiring, the 401K match is awful. They give everything to the pilots (401K match for them is 16%). Let's not even get started on the fact that employees can't even call in sick without being put on a level. Please do yourself a favor and look else where. Don't waist ten years for a company who couldn't care less about you. The company should be ashamed of itself."
bad,the work day was slow and depressing. Management was useless and often times killed morale. They didint really have a good training programs as well. Lastly they lie about how the pay and comission would work out.
bad,"Everyone thinks that being a flight attendant is all glitz and glam, but it is not!  You work on a dirty airplane and are surrounded by constant filth.  All Delta cares about are numbers.  They make cutbacks constantly to make more money.  Delta continues to reconfigure airplanes to make our workspaces smaller and smaller.  This contributes to a poor work environment and extreme discomfort in the workplace.  The trip constructions are not conducive to giving the flight attendants quality of life.   You get paid significantly less for the hours that you are at work.  The healthcare provided is subpar.  You are bullied by the managers when you call in sick more than twice yet you are subjected to so many germs and planes are never properly cleaned.  The cleaners are given 10 min to ""clean"" a plane therefore no real cleaning takes place.  There is always some sort of issue, mechanical, or delay due to a plethora of reasons.  If you want happiness and a good work/life balance, DO NOT work here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,The companty was Aircraft Service International Group which serviced Delta Aircraft. The work environment there was horrible. No adequate pay and employees were not appreciated at all.
bad,"See summary above .I was made to resign after I had been told I was eligible for retirement. I'm not! I have no income, insurance and no longer can I got unemployment"
bad,"fast paced, a lot of information to remember and apply daily per your position. most airliners work off of senority so be mindful of that as far as growth and advancement"
bad,No good  long hours and chasing work all time and very stressful never enjoyed it in end to much pressure and long hours and no life need fresh start and new beginning
bad,i dont need to answer this. this is wild. my review should not have to be included. apparently i have to give a review but why. I guess its because i have to
bad,Save your time do not work for delta; they abuse their workers and they don't appreciate your hard work. If you like to work for free and then delta is the best place for you. Not to mention that they lied to you and tell you that you will get all the benefits and in reality you don't get the benefits unless you have work for them for years. I would not  recommend this place no any one.There is a reason why they are always looking for new people all the time (because people always quit because they found out that other airlines pay better)
bad,"everything about this corporation is a disappointment, needs true leadership. management is thee worst part of it all. no one cares to work with you and aid to your needs."
bad,"The gas stations are terrible. The owners act as if they don't want to fix anything that is wrong with the store. Customers are great. You are required to do everything in the store by yourself. Stock, clean, run cashier, paperwork, inventory, and have it all done before the end of your shift. I believe that this is a little to much expectations just to be paid minimum wage."
bad,"Management is toxic, but the employee makes the company.  New applicants will be forced on probation for 6 months.  You cannot call in sick,  cannot have bad letters from employees or guests and you cannot speak of UNION activities at all.  You will work on old, reconfigured aircraft in all kinds of harsh weather, exposed to disease, fumes and unruly and unappreciative, conniving employees and passengers.  I would highly recommend another airline and stay clear of this atrocious company."
bad,"Bad experience. I was bullied and harassed since day one and management would do nothing about it. Delta is a horrible place to work, a dangerous work environment and they discriminate when it comes to employees."
bad,Delta is a large corporate structure.  They boast as a family environment but don't care about the health or wellbeing of their employees.  It's an anxiety ridden company.
bad,"No comment. Northwest Airlines is out of business. I enjoyed the work, but the flight attendants had access to my editorial files and kept corrupting them, introducing errors of all kinds."
bad,"Be careful if you are a PM and want to do true PM work.  Delta says they want drivers, but if you are not willing stroke the ego of the management and do only reporting then you need not apply."
bad,Delta needs to work on treating their employees better and hiring better management. The culture needs to change. We are grown folks working for a paycheck getting treated like children.
bad,"Agents over there work like their are working for free, always mad and rude with the passengers."
bad,Work schedule is the worst at delta. And pay is very bad! Managers are not trained well. Put under a lot of stress and pressure without the proper training. Not a welcoming environment. Senior workers are not helpful in training and giving advice.
bad,Görev sırsında bıçaklandım 2 ay sonra işten çıkardılar
bad,I hear working in other departments is better but working in reservations is the worst place to work for and when someone complains about something your manager never ever has your back even tho you give passangers the right information.
bad,"you work harder as a temporary employee than any of the full time employees. Literally they always give you more work than they give to fulltime employees. The holiday pay is a sham, the safety first ideal that they preach is bogus, everything is about working faster and doing whatever it takes to get the planes out faster. delta doesn't care about its seasonal or reserve employees and it is shown through the unnecessary aggressive tactics that the management and supervisors use on a consistent basis where they blame the employees lowest on the totem pole and never take responsibility for the unsafe work environment the employees that are overworked and underpaid, nor the lack of functional safe equipment to carry out day to day tasks."
bad,Big lack of communication some employees was rude didn't really feel like they had to give a help in hand will talk over you if u had a question about the job supervisor had their pick or should I say click
bad,"This reminds me of joining the army after high school.  Get promised a lot,  then you get in and it's not at all what's expected....at least the army was fun. Management is a d*mn joke.  They're all on a high horse.  Should have voted union when we had a chance.  can't get properly staffed.  have to know someone to get anywhere."
bad,"Management does not Care about you"
bad,"I just wanted to say that this Airline strives on giving good Customer Service but treats their employees terrible."
bad,"Summary"
bad,"Not a place to work where you try to get your foot in the door as a young person just starting out. If you are a fast paced learner and aren't afraid of responsiblity do know be so forward about showing your knowledge, it will be used against you."
bad,"Extremely unhappy environment, company is very profitable but they pay their employees very low salaries, hence a very high turn over"
bad,a great company to work for Awesome Opportunity to travel and see the World...meet people across cultures....
bad,Horrible company to work for I was a work at home agent they took $1.50 off the hour when I became a work at home agent. It did not bother me at 1st because of the bonus. They then after being home about 3 months changed me and my entire class to another unit where the bonus was impossible to make. No adult can live off Delta base pay. This was a shocker if it was not for the bonus I would not have been able to make it.
bad,"I really enjoyed my time working for Delta and the people I was working with, the day would include taking calls and booking taxis and also dealing with customer issues which included complaints lost property pre bookings, taxi prices etc. The management were great dealing with any problems I had and any help I needed to better myself as did my co-workers who where a great help getting me settled in. The hardest part of the job was getting overtime as staff in the morning got first refusal and I was always on afternoons and lates so made it hard at times. The most enjoyable was working with great staff and helping customers on a daily basis."
bad,"In the current setup the human resource function is just doing the Operations profile for legal compliance and the management wants to improve the Employee Employer relationship and that's why i had been hired."
bad," bom la aprendi a importançiade trabalhar em equipe e "
bad,work daily operations passengers baggage feight deicing of aircraft
bad,"laid back, fun, decent hours but the pay sucks. somtimes a celebrity will fly in but plenty of down time"
bad,Management wants all employees to be against each other that way they can't vote in a union. If you are not the manager’s favorite you should look for another job soon. Sorry I should say at least in ORLANDO FL
bad,very well company to work for and to grow
bad,"Wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Airlines that pays minumum wage and works people to the bone. Local management tries its best to do what they can with what they are given but corporate does not realistically budget for a good operation,"
bad,"Mean back stabbing from fellow employees. When fellow employees give misleading info to sabotage for their advancement ~ management turns a ""blind eye"". No benefit for any new employee as they hire ""ready reserve"" so they can dump you immediately. Poor ""Micro Management"" procedures. Favor some employees over others. Place on probation for actions that others have been doing for years. Very stressful job with no real management encouragement. No advancement for anyone over the age of 25. For such a stressful job they pay 10.00 an hour. And the travel benefits are so restricted that if you get bumped from flight and do not make it back to home station missing part of all of shift. You are placed on probation. Very Stressful without any compassion from Management."
bad,"I have a hard time believing that one of ""America""s Most Admired Companies"" is this toxic of a work environment across all of it's locations and facilities.  Nonetheless, the work environment at this particular job as well as the management was absolutely atrocious.  By far and wide the worst job experience I have ever had.  What a terrible and miserable place to work."
bad,The worst environment to work in lazy lazy people there if you were a hard worker you will be overworked if you are lazy you will thrive the company sucks management is the worst I’ve ever seen
bad,"Working as a ready reserve agent means you can only work 1400 hours per year. Not eligible and you only get free/discounted flights (that's if the plane isn't oversold). It takes 5-7 years to become full-time. This company brags about how much they make, that is so because they'll keep the staff cut short and give you a billion of takes. Ready reserves don't get any benefits and they expect for you to give your heart and soul to delta. I will never brag about delta until I receive benefits. United, Southwest, and American airline all give their part-timers benefits. Delta is full of games and you have to kiss but to get anywhere. If you're looking to be a pilot, work here, if not go back to school."
bad,Never get up from your seat you will be fired all eyes are watching never talk loudly to customers never look at customer too long always greet when walk I. Door or you considered antisocial go to events with coworkers and gossip about job don’t need degree to be manager
bad,"AWFUL AND GETTING WORSE!! Delta’s long term plan is to get rid of the older Flight Attendants and replace them with  millennials by 2020!! So they stalk, harass, demean, and target people to help their goal! It’s disgusting!! No Union, No Respect!! RUN THE OTHER WAY!!"
bad,"They don't care about you and let you get blamed for things out of your control (also with leadership mechanics in 250 and 206). "
bad,Poor job enviroment no advancement or raises your better off working somewhere else. You are better off working anywhere but here in delta. They hire anyone as a supervisor lol
bad,I personally don't advice people to work at delta . It is hard work working on the ramp during inclement weather. during my 8 month there i haven't never experience such mistreatment
bad,"Any other area of the company would be good, but not under the HR umbrella. Anytime leaders have been in place for 35 years, but have never had to earn degrees or learn how to manage people you're going to have problems. There are power hungry females that will end your career with Delta in a heartbeat if you even speak up. They have been labeled ""golden"" because someone recommended them and they were awarded to ""__ Club.""The culture is to put people in a position just because they've ""done their time"" or are able to kiss butt, not because they have proven skills to perform within the position."
bad,Non productive and stressfull environment. Contractors are invited for some company events. Poor team building environment. Low professionalizm.
bad,"Very stressful, no advancement, it takes 10 years to be full time and the company separates ft from pt employees..  Try another airline to work for b/c Delta does not take care of there employees."
bad,"Poor planning."
bad,Always short staffed. Benefits are horrible and pay is extremely low. They change the schedule quite a bit every year and give little to no notice for you to adjust.
bad,Management sucks and they got favoritism on certain employees and for the amount of work u do the pay is to little. Other then that most colleagues are friendly and ppl try to help each other out.
bad,"When it comes down to it, you are valued like a piece of used furniture. The IT management is now in place to make a name for themselves. The culture stinks. Work/job is all that matters now."
bad,"My co workers are always at each other’s throat, there is no room for advancement and if an opportunity comes up and you qualify you will Not get it.."
bad,"Trabalho mais de 4 horas por dia, e ganho bem menos que um salário mínimo por mês"
bad,"If you must work for Delta apply only to full time positions, ideally above-wing (dealing with passengers, etc). New jobs are now mostly for part-timers (no vacation, no health benefits, and very small per-hour salary, so while you have flying benefits, you will not make enough to afford going on vacation). And if you do decide to chance it and work below-wing (aka the ramp) keep in mind that if you get hurt, and you will if you work the ramp, you are toast. The chiropractor will become your new best friend (don't say you were not warned) and staying home means no pay whatsoever while you are out recovering."
bad,"The only good thing was a update salary from minimum wage, easy location to work with a lot of public transportation and 401K benefit. Otherwise, forget about!"
bad,My experience here has been horrible. The company is extremely political. If you attended Michigan State and have no ounce of experience and/or intelligence you will be a manager in no time. The leadership is not diverse at all! And your success purely depends on if your part of the “good ole boys network.”
bad,No wander NWA does not exist anymore. Not the best environment and experience for me.
bad,Worst management and compliance company I've ever worked for which includes all components of management locally and in the corporate offices.........
bad,"Most Flight Attendants do drugs or drink a lot. You kind of have to self medicate to work for them. It's a fun job if you know how to tune literally everyone out. Mean passengers, chatty crew members, pilots that want to flirt with you, etc."
bad,The guys I worked with were rude and I quickly felt out of place not worth the little I was paid for the amount of work required of you. Great if you go to school other than that not for a job to support yourself
bad,"If you don't like to sleep then this is the right company to work for.  As a non-unionized airline the flight attendants are routinely abused and the work rules are awful.  Your day can start at 12am or 4am, it can last for 15 hours after that and once that is over you can be given as little as 8 hours and 40 mins EXACTLY to 'rest'.  Again, if you want to become an insomniac and age ahead of your time then this is the airline to go with!"
bad,"i really have no comment on this,thankyou,i have had a stroke and a very bad back injury,theses things have impacted my ablity to perform any type of work"
bad,great pay after working for almost 8 years but the working conditions were not the greatest. poor management at my station  but the benefits are okay and non union
bad,"Typical day answering inbound calls about missing luggage."
bad,you have a limited amount of hours as a ready reserve and though they say you can easily trade shifts or give away your hours that's far from the case. Won't be seeing any good days off for at least 2 years here at DTW. If you use all your hours they threaten you with the idea that you might not be rehired if you get layed off for the year. More focused on profit then taking care of their employees
bad,Good pay. Behind the scenes illegal practices of age discrimination and other violations   Very unhappy employees.  Hostile work environment. Constant flight delays and broken equipment. Passengers are placated with replies of I apologize which results in no getting an answer. Agents always trying to avid dealing with disgruntled passengers and pushing their responsibilities off on the flight attendants Minor Mechanical issues written off to get the flight out.  Ovens on the aircraft are often broken taking longer to heat meals and get the service done leaving passengers hungry and waiting for a salty over cooked or burned meal.  Constant management changes because they are over worked and not given the proper training to assist the flight attendants.
bad,"The job is not as glamorous as most people think. Yes, you are there for safety but most customers see you as a glorified refreshment server. Passengers are rude to you all the time and the management will not back you up. The planes are filthy beyond belief and that is your daily work environment. If you think you will ""see the world"", think of this: international flights leave in the evening and arrive when it's about 3-4am at home. Your body clock is in your home time zone. You have 24 hour rest at destination. You are picked up 3 hours before departure time and you also need to sleep. Doesn't leave you any time or energy to explore. The job burns you out very quickly. The first 3 to 5 years you will have very little control over your schedule. Yes, there are senior people who work at the airline for 20+ years but a lot of them are women with rich husbands who work for flight benefits and don't fly a lot."
bad,"If they tell you-you have to stay you do, or you get fired.  If you ask for days off and then something comes up and its a mandatory 4 day weekend you have to work you no longer get your days off.  When you first start working there they tell you once your training is done you get to bid for shift change... Not true!  You will be at midnights for years unless you know somebody... You never get to use your flight benefits because they NEVER let you have time off!  There is never enough managers to help and they DO NOT care about their EMPLOYEES just their Customers!"
bad,"Job was very routine, and employees seem to be lethargic. Not all, but most don't care about others. Higher management tends to be bias to senior management. Management can lie on personnel and nothing is done, but move anyone around that they do not agree with. Also, conceal evidence that is not in their favor.  They do protect senior management even when wrong. Strong work place culture even when wrong. Most enjoyable part of job is getting paid, and benefits."
bad,Terrible place to work.  Inexperienced Management team and poor training programs.  There isn't a team atmosphere culture despite being lead to believe that there is one.  Misleading goals and objectives.
bad,"This is the worst station to work at for Delta Air Lines.  Management is horrible! They are never held accountable for their actions, quick to blame each other and the agents. Always competing against one another to shine for the big boss. They do not care for the employees as they call us ""idiots"".  The trainers do not properly train new agents as you are just thrown out on the job and learning on your own.  Corporate needs to come in and start cleaning house with these managers as they all lie and cheat just to get promoted! They hire managers who have no clue how to run an operation.  Also going on retreats leaving no mamagers to run the operation and the biggest ""abusing their corporate credit card""!!!  If management do not like you they'll put a red flag on you and find anything to get you fired along with preventing you from getting promoted as they'll feel you'll take their job from them!!"
bad,"I was hired as a Manager to create a group within IT. Once hired things changed quickly, the role wasn't what was advertised. Other Managers and Directors had 0 experience in the field but were promoted because of ""time of service"". A year and a half after being in my role and hiring my team Delta did a huge layoff of IT. This company is a joke to work for and I would highly avoid it at all costs."
bad,Love to travel but the schedule is exhausting. Never the same and a lot of stress and high expectation. The job itself is pretty good if you don't mind being away from home and you don't have a family. It takes many years to get seniority.
bad,"Cut throat atmosphere, out for themselves (management) take credit for others work and ideas. Typically fire 20 plus year employees over lies. Avoid if you can"
bad,"There were a lot of supervisors and managers that had no business being in those postitions. A very ""clickish"" environment. Working outdoors in extreme weather got old fast."
bad,I learn to socialize more better and to keep a clean and safe environment for me and others learn to let things go and speak to someone over me if there was a problem I learn to work well with other and to  communicate with many other people and a respect menner
bad,I was a ramp agent for DGS for 4 years and a lead ramp agent for 1 year. I loved my job and met some amazing people but can’t live off love. I was getting 12.10 as a lead maxed out and they took leads away and I dropped down to 10.60 the insurance is completely laughable and just really a joke in all honesty. I got fired cause I put the company on blast for being cheap and unfair. The more you know the more the responsibilities with nothing extra. It’s sad that everyone can be replaced at DGS is Delta’s eyes.
bad,"a empresa e boa de se trabalhar,os amigos são alegres,A parte mais dificil é as vezes a falta de material para trabalhar e o salario quando atrasa."
bad,"A real shame as it could have been a wonderful place to work. But the management politics keep getting in the way at every turn. And, they have two small aircraft. To tax justify them (actually toys for upper management) they expect you to always fly in these small 1 engine planes; even if they have to hire a pilot for you."
bad,It was too many ppl trying to be a manager and too many people handling the money when the luggage is paid for with cash.  Couldn't go over a certain amount of hours
bad,"Entered this position excited to contribute to whatever project they wanted me to work on as a Sr. developer, but was put on a team working with software developers who haven't brushed up on their software development lifecycle standards in 10+ years. "
bad,"Physical Job, picking up luggages and puting them in the right carts. Management, scheduling and Co-workers are not in order."
bad,Delta has two kinds of employees. Ready reserve . No  benefits  health ect. Just flight privileges. Limited hours get laid off after 999 hours in a year then asked to rehire. Benefited employees are only  pre-merger  Northwest/delta 10yrs ago. No chance to get benefited.
bad,"Very poor new management. They started finding excuses to fire all experienced workers. Everyone is afraid to try and do their job with the haunting of management around us. Waiting to fire us. Management has a clique of all the people they like and if you're not apart of it, you'll get harder punishments. People in the group usually don't get in trouble at all."
bad,"I did not mind the work at delta. I usually got along with the passengers that I spoke to on the phone. I provided them with knowledge and the best customer service, even when problems existed. I did not like how I was micro managed on a regular basis. I do not think that they believe in positive reinforcement. We had to pay for everything! including purchasing tickets for our own Christmas parties. I had to bid on shifts that were based on seniority every 3 months. Days off and start and end times changed every time a shift bid changed. It did not matter if it worked for you or not. I learned more geography then I have known before."
bad,"Part time workers, Ready Reserves, do the exact same work as full time, but are treated like indentured servants.  If the Delta Family includes Ready Reserves, it's as undervalued step-children. Ready Reserves work-life balance, health, flexibility aren't a priority. The Delta culture places full time workers comfort, health, happiness, way above ready reserves.  In Nashville, the difference in how the full time & ready reserves  are valued is extreme.  Anything that ready reserves get (after years of service!), weekends off, or a better schedule, a raise, anything, and the full time workers complain bitterly. The unbelievable and saddest thing is that Nashville management listens and the hard won improvements are taken away.  This is the most unequal place I have ever worked."
bad,"I just didn’t like the way the company handles their employees, the management will not be on the same page what so ever and it’s like you really have to fight to secure your position within. Delta could be a top employer if they took better care of their employees. For the simple fact that they don’t have a union, you could be out there busting your butt and if they feel like you’re not a fit candidiate, they’ll just get rid of you."
bad,"No communication  poor mgmt"
bad,This was a temporary position.  I do not feel I have enough knowledge on the company to write any type of review.  The full time people seem to be happy with their jobs.
bad,"The senior leadership at Delta is very strong and committed to the mission. The local leadership is laughable, greedy, self-interested, and incapable of doing the right thing."
bad,Was one of the most stressful jobs I've ever had. Had to listen to people constantly yell at me on the phone and the management had no compassion when my grandfather was passing away and needed time off.
bad,A typical day at work is very demanding and very toxic. You could not trust anyone. I wish anyone that works there. Good luck.. I learned what not to do by the local management.
bad,"I am dependable and enjoy interacting with people.  With my various experiences and my willingness to learn, I feel I would be a valuable employee to any company. "
bad,did not enjoy working here they did not pay well at all for the amount of work they expected you to do. was supposed to get a review and raise after 3 months I was there for 8 months and never got it I would not recommend anyone to work for them
bad,"Was a great place to work until the Northwest and the union busters moved in, bust the Mechanics Union so they could sell out to Delta. Airlines are good o'l boys network when it comes to management."
bad,Terrible shifts with 26 to 30 years and can not hold a day shift position
bad,contract position and was fun for the time that I was there. We had a lot of food and gifts that were given to us as contractors. Overall it is a fun place to be for a while.
bad,"I worked for Delta for six and half years and while I liked the travel benefits (which were barely worth it) there was really NO other positive side to the job. I started in Reservations which was very demanding with low pay. Loved the people I worked with in CVG (BIG shoutout!!!). ACS was another story. A typical work day was pretty bad as it was a stressful work environment where you constantly felt like you were on the chopping block. Management was awful, played favorites and were very underhanded. Don't bother standing up for yourself or having a voice---BAD IDEA as you were then a target. Forget EVER having a holiday or weekend off. Constant rotating shifts with terrible pay so there was no point in traveling since you couldn't even afford to buy yourself a sandwich :-( I have never been as broke in my whole life as I was working for Delta Airlines!!!"
bad,"I've worked for Delta Air Lines for the past 24 years.  In the beginning middle management cared and they motivated you. Now middle management does not care about you as a person.  They only care about you as a number and are willing to violate the company's policies for the ""operation"".  It's become a hard place to work."
bad,"No advancement options, salary doesn't live up to work done. Only good thing is the benefits. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone else to wor if you're looking for advancement options."
bad,"If your thinking that this company will care about you or your well being , you are sadly mistaken. Management is horrible and have terrible attitudes. A sense of entitlement is amongst anyone who has been there a day longer than you. Management will try to intimidate you every chance they get. Selling pipe dreams is an understatement with this company."
bad,Job is not secure and pay is easily messed up from people in payroll.
bad,"Delta is a great company as a whole but the HR/Recruiting Department was there only because it ""had to be there"".  HR employees gave 100% and enjoyed the team I worked with."
bad,No primeiro dia foi bem difícil pois colocaram para entregar senha que não era o meu cargo aprendi a direcionar as pessoas para as partes certa do banco as pessoas que realmente precisavam falar com o gerente demoro uns 3 dias para poder pegar a pratica depois fui conhecendo mais com a minha colega de trabalho ela ia me ajudando em algumas coisas a parte mais difícil era se dar com alguns cliente como tínhamos regras la algumas pessoas queriam que fizemos coisas que não estava autorizadas para nos mais era agradável pois eu ficava satisfeita por ajudar as pessoas e ver que ela saiam satisfeita também
bad,"People are cool, the shift hours suck if you haven't been there for a while. And getting approved time off is hard. And the manager says he's on your side but if you can't make it to work due to illness you get an ultimatum."
bad,"Typical work day is very unpredictable/predictable"
bad,"work hard as a Ramp agent, from a 4AM till late afternoon.... terrible pay $7.00 an hr... the co worker is rude towards me when am doinng my job i had no problem minding my own business... this  the cultuere against a minor person... no unemployment compensation for working 6 months on the job...."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was to make the reservations for the people that needed to travel.
bad,Delta is the only legacy carrier without unionized Flight Attendants. Enough said! The company is so massive that you get lost in the crowd and management doesn’t care about your individual concerns. From day one they expect you to “drink the Kool-Aid”. They propagate this belief that Delta is the best in the business and that you should just be happy to be a part of it. Proceed with caution
bad,"They like to say how much they pay their employees but what they don't tell you is how much employee expenses are increasing.  There really is no raise.  Actually a loss.  Higher tax bracket and more out of pocket expenses.  Yes, you can fly for $50 a year, but its stand by.  Who has time to sit in an airport for days to try and get on an already oversold flight.  When you can get on, its great. but don't plan on traveling all the time.  "
bad,terrible management and no room to grow.  if you are not in the click you are not going to last long.  There are only full time workers that get most of the benefits and other workers get the bad hours.  No job security at this place.  Lots of gossiping.
bad,it is fun and a lot of work moping is hard at top nice
bad,"Assisring clients with fare and flight information. Holding fare schedules for 24hours. Confirming flights and delays, rescheduling customers from cancelled flights."
bad,"We would load and unload planes in a timely manner. Safefy is very important as well. We work in terrible conditions. We work outside."
bad,A job for those who truly desire a passion to help others reach their destination. Must have great customer service skill and require minimum to no supervision
bad,They put profits over people. They kept me as a temp employee for 7.5 years after promising me I would be hired on in 6-12 months. I left a great paying job for what was promised to be a career. After a few years of temp work at delta having them stringing me along i was left poor and broken. I had lost the ability to pay my mortgage and support my family.
bad,"Very poor leadership at Director/VP Level. Passive aggressive people promoted rather than counseled. "
bad,"Delta subcontracts in out stations. If you are not at a main hub, most likely you are subcontracted. The pay scale reflects as well, less pay. Management changes frequently Travel with standby quite frankly is horrible. You cannot get anywhere during the summer months and holidays."
bad,Not a career jobs it is a temp job sot something for life. This is not a job if u want something to advance and make a career out if it. There no benefits and you'll be working 40+ a week and will not be treated fairly.
bad,"Great travel benefits, 401k match, etc...Culture is not a fit for everyone.  Highly political. Accomplishments and experience are not always recognized, especially if you are a technical professional."
bad,i would love to work there again but the pay sucks and the managers play favorites. A typical work day was either working at the gate or the ticket counter . Hardest part of the job was oversold and delayed flights . If you cant handle pressure dont work there
bad,"It might seem great when you first start. Flight benefits are amazing but it is easy to realize that they use this as an excuse for low pay, and stressful work environment."
bad,"Degree or no degree, you will start part time with Delta. Depending on which station you're assigned, your shifts will most likely be 4 hour days, 5 days a week (Because who doesn't want to tie up 5 days a week for a part time/second job). You can trade shifts and double, but you're responsible for finding a trade partner. It takes about 5 years to get a full time offer with them, and everything is senority based. Being a hard worker does you no good with this company. Station management will short staff the station, so you work harder and they get a bigger bonus. Want a foot in the door in the airline business? Pick a different airline."
bad,Beneficial but pay is not so good. If you are interested in flying around the world but don't necessarily need the money then it is a good fit. I was not a flyer so therefore it did not benefit me.
bad,"Unhealthy work life balance. In the brief period I have worked here health insurance has changed for the worst and overall compensation is not worth the time and money invested into this type of lifestyle. The only way it seems people are able to advance their career is if they have an in with the right person, not by merit."
bad,This is not a bad company to work for unless it is winter time. Then unless your an outside person this job is not for you i can guarantee you that.
bad,Company is not for employees.  Work in bad working conditions.  If it was not for the flying benefits job sucks.  Very dangerous high number of on job injuries
bad,I worked with good people but it was a short term job from the beginning.
bad,"There is not much room for advancement within this company. Typically, you are given more tasks and responsibilities, but with no compensation."
bad,"doing airplane security sweeps and loading un unloading planes"
bad,"Muy grato ambiente laboral, con turnos extremos bajo mucha presión. Por otra parte, excelentes beneficios de vuelo. En relación a la renta, es bastante cuestionable tomando en cuenta las exigencias y compromisos que esta conlleva."
bad,affords a nurse multiple types of mental health work. There is work also in the subtance abuse rehab arena.
bad,A typical day at work changes from day to day you never know what you have going on.
bad,"You will be overworked. We're constantly short on manpower, but management still wants you to get the job done with less. They preach ""safety first,"" but they squeeze their employees for every ounce of productivity. Many people go out on injury due to the heavy workload. Management doesn't care. You are disposable."
bad,"I worked at Delta for six and a half years and I’m completely disappointed with the culture they brag so much about. In the call center I worked in, you had to be part of the click to get ahead. It’s not what you know it’s who you know. Delta desperately needs a Union. There is nothing in place to protect its employees if your treated unfairly or if your accused of doing something that may put your job in jeopardy . I once held delta to the highest esteem but seeing how they operate especially in the Tampa call center, I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone. Go to Jet Blue"
bad,"This is nothing more than a temporary job, the fellow employees are good to work with but the corporation does not actually care about its employees and their success"
bad,Work rule are in place but lax until management need to blame someone for something even if they are not guilty of anything. Then they want to fire you.
bad,"the company is very flexible with schedule. pay is ok. flying benefits are great. but management makes working for this company a nightmare. it was a lot better, now it is just stressfull to work there."
bad,"The company wants to live up to ""Delta's"" standards but doesn't provide Delta type training or equipment. The flight ""benefits"" has become a joke over the years it's more like a perk. It was like pulling teeth trying to get days off to fly and they do not treat the veterans well at the job. The corporate office isn't knowledgeable and does a lot of he say she say with no evidence to back anything up and becomes irritated when asked to provide proof."
bad,"Turn over rate is extremely high mostly because the company doesn’t pay anything, barely get 40 hours I have 3 jobs because I can’t afford to live off Delta Security, other city and states make more than Atlanta, I have applied for other positions throughout the company had serveral interviews it seems like everything is based on favoritism... Even Supervisor are leaving"
bad,Reservations is micromanaged from the top down by people who have never done this job or haven't done this job in decades. The demands are unreasonable for the pay. The majority of everything is negative. Everything is based on numbers which are arbitrarily created by those who don't know how to do this job. The manufactured stress is unhealthy. This department has been described by those in the medical field as a toxic work environment.
bad,"The internal fighting between the Delta legacy employee and the Northwest employees makes for a very tense and counter productive work environment. This behavior starts at the top, SVP and VP levels. SMH."
bad,"It is true, this is the worst place i could wish to someone to work for. The Account Manager is so heartless racist woman who enjoy watching immigrant employees crying and begging just to be treated with respect.The Operation Manager is a Mexican guy who doesn't like to touch anything at all."
bad,"I wouldn't advise anyone who has a family to work for this company unless you have a second job. However you do  you learn about teamwork, leadership, time management, how to handle situations under pressure."
bad,Working on the ramp is dangerous and everyone should have some type of health insurance. I've almost lost my legs twice because of one else's neglence. For the Ready Reserve program Delta's management isn't willing to work with individuals schedule and expect people to live off 1400 hours a year making less then $13 an hour.
bad,This job at first was okay and seemed great to work as a team but you soon realize how shady people are and it really hurts your self esteem because of how bad the management is in Delta. The Manager for Delta is very shady and only keeps his fiji people close to him and puts others at weird and unconditional shifts. That to me is poor management and Delta needs to hire another General Manger.
bad,"every day was a different problem, workers felt job was not worth throwing their back out, fun for a shot time but not for long run"
bad,"Hard work but never boring.  Always something to be learned at a drop of a hat. Very smart team. Well established company, just no room for advancement."
bad,"No direct management organizational ability . Constant mixed messages , attempts to get everyone on board with putting students first however they do not value employees . Most employees are in fear of their jobs. I give this poorly managed company another year and they will be closed down . Horrible morale but anyone who speaks out about it and they will find a way to get you out."
bad,"An anti-union propaganda effort on the part of management has left the employees of this company as vulnerable as dead red meat under a flock of vultures. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME building up years at this company, or you will be left with nothing."
bad,Could use improvement in multiple areas.  Pay is appropriate for the position.  The culture of the company could be improved.
bad,i learned how to operate forklift and work alone. it had a lot of drama with workers and only one camera worked in warehouse.
bad,"Working at NWA was a typical corporate environment but did learned to ride an aircraft from and to the gate area. This was only done after hours by ground operators. The station manager was the great guy and I am still friend with until today. Though, we, the ground workers didn't have much contact with management except the station manager. The difficult part I would say was the attitudes by few co-workers refusing to do the job because it isn't on their union lease. Overall, the job got done because we have an obligation for on time departure/arrivals.Thus, the most enjoyable part of job was free flights benefits, got dominated for global peace initiative for Darfur, Sudan."
bad,horrible management and treatment of the employees. happily not employed by delta airlines
bad,Company merged with Delta. I took a early retirement buy-out. I enjoyed my job as a F/A and had over 18 years with the company. The reason I gave them 3 or less stars is because Northwest Airlines really no longer exists.
bad,There was a lot of favortism while I worked at Delta. The two great benefits were the flying privileges and the time off with pay. There where however a lot of downsides.
bad,Une journée de travail se compose de plusieurs façon :
bad,No where to advance. They try to keep you in one place. Management is not willing to listen to reason.
bad,"The flight benefits are great, when you can get a flight or time off. Working the ramp can be grueling, and the passengers, well, its customer service."
bad,Terrible senior management and a horrific HR Department. No support from what's supposed to be a system to help when in need. I've never been so unhappy in a workplace until I worked for Delta.
bad,"Commute is a major trouble and work environment not good. It was very stressful and management was really poor."
bad,It's a tough job to get ahead in. Delta is a loyal company. It just does not benefit new employees but for those that are there for years it will benefit them.
bad,"A typical day at DAL consisted of an average 3 meetings a day.  (sometimes more).  I learned to focus and prioritize my duties.  As a contractor, I answered to at least 3 Project Managers.  There were SMEs who were former DAL employees and understood the functionality of the system we were working to replace.  The hardest part of the job was acquiring information from persons who worked for a different Resourcing vendor and being allowed to follow QA Best Practice during crunch time.  I learned a lot about functioning productively in a high pressured environment and I will take that with me wherever I go."
bad,"I worked as a customer Service supervisor for nine years with Northwest Airlines."
bad,"Your day starts with your first flight of your shift. you would be handling bags for most of the shift."
bad,good work place we can make our own decision to work and friendly environment to work with in the organization and learnt many new technologies over here
bad,The pay was good.  The free travel and  discounts for many companies were great.  The opportunity for health care and benefits was good.  The senior leadership leaves a lot to be desired for.  No confidence in the senior group.
bad,the only really good aspects of this job were the pay and the hours were for the most part stable. they did tend to give little notice when mandatory weekends were added
bad,"I think this company is a good place to work, but the contractors really only get a check, there is no work place balance, there are no benefits to working at one of the greatest companies.."
bad,Management made it very difficult to work with. Employees were getting write ups for quota. Long time employees were being harassed to leave or to take certain shifts.
bad,"I wouldn't say that Delta Airlines is a bad company to work for but be aware of the subcontracted sister companies that serve under airlines names. It also highly depends on where your stationed and the types of people you work with that can make it a good environment or not. "
bad,Overall I liked working at Delta until recent changes in Management have ruined the place seems the company now like to target people and make examples out of them.
bad,"Delta as a company is a contradiction. On one hand, it treats it's operation employees extremely well, it builds an atmosphere of family, and goes out of it's way to make everyone ""feel good"". On the hand, it is resistant to change, has created a corporate culture built on tenure, and has become so insular at the corporate level that anyone not from the operation is excluded from all but the most elementary positions."
bad,"Management team are racist at the reservation dept. Especially HR John McDonough who stated to other managers ""why are they still hiring Africans who speak french for the reservation?"" Social media managers Michelle Brittian & Tammie Duncan shared the same point of view as John. They forced employees to do 4hrs of overtime mandatory every day even when operations are down."
bad,"I guess it's okay if you don't mind working overtime hours. Being part-time you didn't get benefits, and sometimes you were scheduled to work 8 hours and then end up just working 6 or less. Found a full-time job and left."
bad,"Most enjoyable part of job was team work and comradely. IT jobs always subject to being off-shored or contracted out. Delta at one time valued the fact that they maintained employees and the did not outsource. Delta provided itself on promoting from within. Delta now goes through an annual ""Blood-Letting"" and severs long term employees to drop the bottom line by removing employee salaries by cutting their job."
bad,"I found Delta to be very typical of many corporate environments.  Low pay, average benefits package and few opportunities for advancement.  Very few opportunities available for people of color."
bad,"Mostly under managed, expected to work 6 days a week.  High turnover rate but mostly good employees stuck around.  Learned a lot as a first year and was given a good amount of responsibility that i would not have otherwise had with another company."
bad,"The Significant Contributions;"
bad,"Apparently, Delta has been going through a culture shift for the past few years and the ""old"" Delta is losing out to the corporate drones that value the bottom line over the customer and employees experience. This is not news to anyone who has traveled recently."
bad,"After 9/11 they went downhill before then they were a great company, I loved to be able to fly anywhere course I ever got the time off to fly there so that was a draw back no time off my days would be spread out"
bad,"Delta is an enormous company and they favor flight attendants in both the field and corporate settings. Mostly promotes from within, and often times promote people with little to no knowledge of their new roles due to huge profit increases."
bad,"working in a high paced environment for a company who doesn't respect their employees, but wants to portray to the media and general public that they are an employee friendly company."
bad,"Ramp operations which includes the following lift, load, unload, and transport baggage, mail, and cargo to and from aircraft. Duties also include operating ground support equipment such as tugs, conveyor belts and tow tractors."
bad,Enjoy the journey in the airline but the last manager was a total joke. She favor counterpart and allowed him to date team member
bad,"- Assist Passengers with checking in."
bad,"Costumer Service oriented position requiring leadership, translation, enforcement of safety regulations."
bad,loading bags on the plane Coworker where nice people. management did not do much at all
bad,this company was nice in how they treat there people id deff work for them again
bad,I was an independent contractor. This question should be optional and not mandatory. I am not an employee and have never been an employee at Delta Air Lines.
bad,"I worked for Delta for 2 years as a Ready Reserve Ramp Agent.  I enjoyed the physical nature of the job.  People you work with don't talk much.  Culture is non-existent.  People have been there for 15+ years average and all you hear is complaining from the old-timers.  My wife got laid off from her job so I was forced to get another job, which cut into my work schedule for Delta.  I was an impeccable employee and because I wasn't able to give 2 weeks notice, they deemed me unable to be rehired.  I'm really disappointed.  Felt like trash once they knew I couldn't work there anymore.  Training is terrible and you'll get in trouble for every detail.  Hard work is not valued here."
bad,"Fast paste no time for work life balance. Would not advise working from Dallas, Travel is good but very hard to get out of this hub on off days and very hard to return."
bad,"I learned to be a strong human being. I learned what I want out of life - to be treated with the same respect I give to my fellow employees, passengers, etc."
bad,"Delta Airlines is not how they claim to be. They pretend to care about safety regulations but they don't. they reprimand their employees on ""so call"" safety violations but don't follow their own or FAA rules. Not only that, they always look for ways to not pay people what they have earned or deserved. Delta airlines is the most disorganized company I have ever worked for. Their leadership team members are all on completely different pages and they operate more by individuals than a unit. Not only that, they require employees to follow the company's ""standard operating procedures"" which is something they never follow. Delta airlines is truly a company that is all about who you know. There is much favoritism and racism within the company. For the most part, the only a lot of people want to keep their employment there is because of the flight benefits."
bad,"I know my experience was not the norm as I was a contractor. I worked in HR and the Manager was a liar and no one trusted her. In the end I asked for a meeting in private to discuss her disparagement practices (Radical Candor) the next day I was walked out-fired. This is a person that everyone was afraid of and I was told that if I had applied to a role in Delta without first asking for her approval that she would purposely lie to the hiring manager. "
bad,I knew going in that this was not going to be a glamorous job. I enjoy airplanes and being around aircraft but this is looking like not the job for me. Management thinks yelling and getting upset at employees is how to manage. You can correct someone when they are doing something wrong by not yelling at us like a we are children. The training leaves much to be desired. My trainer has a habit of disappearing leaving me in the lurch. I usually end up shadowing someone who is not my trainer. No one tells you anything they just assume you know how to do it. Sent on wheel chair run and had to figure out how to negotiate the airport on my own. Luckily the airport I work at is small. Do not know how much longer I can take this. Flight benefits are not worth the work environment.
bad,be prepared to play political games instead of work.  constantly set up for failure and given minimal support to correctly safeguard your license.  horrible hours
bad,"Worked at Delta for over 20 years, fired recently for a minor rule violation, no union. Management in PDX breaks the rules to protect their cronies. Once you are at the top pay scale, after at least 10 years, Watch your back."
bad,Delta was too large of a company for me. Everyone is just an employee ID number. Most often then not their entry level jobs are part time. Also they prefer to hire mgt positions from with in.
bad,"A day at Delta was a rollercoaster ride with changing work rules everyday.Delta didn't like the employees that worked for Northwest airlines. They treated us like we were their enemy. although they gave us a bonus. The new people that they hired weren't accountable for anything they did. They were allowed to sit there and watch everyone else work. And the department managers, told us we couldn't say anything to them."
bad,"Great company but was refused assistance for housing when operations at JFK underwent renovation therefore not allowing for housing and share boards during renovation."
bad,"Although I love the company, it is very hard to have a family life with the company.  It is very hard to get time off, unless you have seniority with the company.  The base pay is really hard for new employees and the life style change is also difficult.  However, I have never worked at a more fun, exciting job before in my life.  "
bad,"Was hired in to close a station, but wasn't told that. Work was tedious, trying to back track through years of inventory movements that had gone unrecorded. Got to travel a lot. Bosses had zero idea how to effectively manage their assets."
bad,"A lot of pressure from company to perform in a timely basis."
bad,"A typical day at work consist of checking in passengers, dealing with ticketing issues, bags, gates, boarding."
bad,It's a horrible place to work where you are never appreciated by the management. Hard work is never recognized. The mentality in this department is that you are lucky to have this job. I am trying to find something else as soon as possible.
bad,I start at 4:30 am and begin to check customer in then head to the gate the board the aircraft. the most enjoyablepart is i am always meeting new people.
bad,"Every call is monitored, you handle customer complaints - often without anything you can do about the problem. Your calls are taped, and 3 calls a month are scrutinized to see if you are ""Brand-tastic"", ""Brandish"" or a Brand-miss"". You have no choice which calls are selected - and these calls determine whether you will be given a ""Pass"", or face disciplinary actions for the next month."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting deadlines in a team oriented enviornment. I also like the open door policy, and frequent feed back from team players how things can be done more efficiently."
bad,Delta is a nice airline .. It's just the I think it's kinda a cult culture..they make up the most ridiculous rules..they are Ran as the marines of the airline industry..definitely a cult culture tho..
bad,"they hired sodexo magic as their agency.sodexo is the worst.their ethiopian supervisors are racist,sexist and have no common sense.i wonder how they even got their position.manager has favoritism.and if your new.they will bully you.had to see a therapist after.im talking about seattle sodexo for delta airlines.only few survived here.lack of staff make you work double.even at break room they will follow you."
bad,"Program Manager (Contractor)was rude and used demeaning language to the entire team."
bad,"Well, I came from a regional air line working line maintenance and working line maintenance now at delta. Everyone at the regional said delta would be better. Let me tell you the grass isn’t always greener on the other side of the fence. I am not here to just complain to you how I am not happy or tell you how the company owes me something... I am simply here to provide an honest review and since it’s honest, I will tell you what I like and dislike so far. "
bad,"very under paid for amount of responsibility. No real management, employees complain a lot, not many people with any idea on what customer service really is. Training from one shift to next is not consistent. Want too many job to overlap so no training from beginning to end on any task assigned. Too much inappropriate behavior and gossip.No employee satisfaction."
bad,"I worked as a ready reserve where you were only allowed to work a selected amount of hours per year. This was a fun job, however, it did not allow for growth."
bad,"the company pushes the delta culture they drill it into your mind almost like a cult, the management. management puts a lot of pressure on you when they dont like you they really attack you and everything you do is wrong"
bad,"Management is a disgrace. they lie, they don't like paying their employees money that is owed to them and extremely inconsiderate. terrible people to associate yourselves with. the ONLY perk working for delta is their flight benefits. being able to fly whenever you want, wherever you want, is a wonderful thing. I miss that so much!"
bad,"job was good , Didn't have time to use the perks but all was a good learning experience . Liked being around the different planes . Hours were the only pro being it worked as a senority list"
bad,"Most work days are 12 hours plus."
bad,Enjoyed the job and the whole idea of it but didnt get on with the management team well atall they didnt have any idea what they were doing.
bad,I worked for Northwest Airlines for 20 years and was laid off during the merger. I very much enjoyed the culture and fellowship of this industry. The technology of fly by wire and industry standards provided a solid foundation for my present career.
bad,"90% of the co-workers don't look forward to coming to work at that department."
bad,great way to manage weight as you continually work either in your area or helping your neighbors dangerous if you don't pay attention
bad,"i learned to not trust management and that dont expect too many opportunities to advance unliess you are related to someone in managemanet. "
bad,While I will always care for Delta's health - I have to be honest in sharing that it's ethics have suffered in the last decade. It is why I opted to leave early. It is primarily it's management and their lack of mentoring or even caring about the quality employee. There are employees there that do absolutely nothing. If I was asked to make a list I could easily write 50 names down. And write down only a handful of great dedicated employees.
bad,Great place to work and for advancement before the unfortunate events of 911. Not the same after that.
bad,"Old methodologies in a new age. Operation personnel placed in IT roles...great SMEs, but definitely BA material as typically titled. Big company syndrome overall...just throw money at a project without any thought of value-add or risk."
bad,It’s really about the culture and flight benefits that makes this job worth it. Really just average pay. Nothing to make you want to retire here. I’m a peoples person. So I enjoy the people I get to meet more than the job itself.
bad,"Delta is a good company that rewards it's employees.  They also have bad managers.  They are always willing to promote the brand with good deeds to consumers, but are lacking when responding to employee issues.   Their managers lack empathy for  for worker issues and stick with one another upholding policy even when the polices fail to address the proper solution.  I give them good grades for being innovative and staying away from the status quo when comparing to other large corporations.  Their arrogance sometimes get in the way of them being the best company to work for even though  they try very hard."
bad,The last year has been a year of transition within the Delta IT Team.  This transition has been very stressful due to lack of transparency. The Leadership Team doesn't interact much with the folks that are doing the actual work and that causes a disconnect.
bad,"Took calls making airline reservations, checking for mileage awards or upgrades. Checked for flight availity, if flights were on time. Would rebook passengers due to missed flights, weather, of unforeseen delays. Would also advise passengers where to go to file or check on lost luggage."
bad,"Festive workplace, able to travel free, stressful. it was nice to fly for free as an employee but stressful workplace due to unprepared management and slow outdated computer systems with delta term systems."
bad,great place to work and great people to work with. Great atmosphere and enjoy meeting knew people from all over the world. But it can be very demanding.
bad,"Fun place to work. Great management leadership, great benefits, room for advancement. the pay was good and teamwork was provided. I love providing customer service and meeting new people over the phone. I love to make people smile and hang out with my coworkers. Delta was an excellent place to work."
bad,I traveled the world and saw places I would have never seen otherwise!
bad,"Vejo a Delta,como uma empresa onde seus administradores não fazem seu papel correto,por conta de salários atrasados, recisões pagas incorretas e um salário baixo."
bad,"Great People,  Good travel benefits. Good training and advancement opportunities."
bad,"Poor management, lack of appreciation and valuing of employees. Bad scheduling and not enough people always short staff always so workplace becomes a hazard for doing double the work of what you are paid for."
bad,"A lot of the CEO talk is centered around the people, or employee culture. Specifically the ramp employees and ticketing/baggage/gate boarding employees have the hardest job working physically  and mentally yet many factors weigh into not protecting their jobs due to Georgia being a right to work state and no frontline worker union is in place. Human Resources should be there to protect the interests of the employees but really serve the interests of senior management who only cater to and serve the interests of the shareholders which is why the frontline employees will always be the least important thing to the company and the claim that the employees culture being the most important thing Delta is focused on is very untrue."
bad,".  Below Wing Operation- (AIC)team leader, Marshalling, Wing-Walking, Baggage, Cargo handling, GSE checks"
bad,"This job was a lot of fun I was able to travel anywhere in the US for free, and internationally for the price of the tax on a ticket. the pay was not that great, but good for just getting out of high school. I never worked over 8 hours."
bad,if you re not traveling you should not  be working here.  take advantage of the benefits to travel the world. go out and meet people that's the only benefit.
bad,"the only thing good about this job is the flight benefits, after that, they just work you like a dog. you hardly get days off and they don't really care about your well being."
bad,Delta stacks shifts so that it is nearly impossible to get full time hours or overtime. Supervisors will try and find any person to blame for a short coming as a team.
bad,"No Review is required.  This was a contract position with no opportunity for advancement or to really show my experience or skills.  Disappointed in my manager, but company was great."
bad,good place to work relaxed what ever you need to do a job they provided worked with a lot of professional people who did quality work. worked as a contractor did not get total benefits.
bad,"This is an airline, therefore you have many opportunities here. You can train in many areas  after you have been with them for awhile Keep in mind you will be working in extreme temperatures and have to dress accordingly"
bad,"funções pertinentes a produção. embalar, fazer colagem, contagem, conferencia. trabalho em equipe muito bom."
bad,"I still work there. I can not say too much at this point in time. Like any jobs there are pros and cons, but people have to be willing to change in order for any of these comments to matter."
bad,heavy work load. Stand on your feet most of the time. Friendly co workers.
bad,"Long days, and could get stressful when customers take their anger out on you. The best part of the job is when grateful customers truly appreciated your help."
bad,"Integrating fun and interactive activities with children's friendly,cheerful,honest,and dependable personality Able to give detailed and accurate care to clients making sure their basic needs are met great communication skills with ability."
bad,"short and sweet if you dont plan on having a life, no set schedule, working at all types of times of the day and $10 an hour this job is for you. The people i worked with made the job better. Flight benifits. Could never use them because of the schedule."
bad,"I will take what every will take me to do, to show my best working for Delta"
bad,I learned how to be a team worker. I had also learned more about customer service.
bad,"Работа хорошая ,карьерный рост есть но переживание будут ли менять свои оконабалконные конструкции или нет это не очень хорошо."
bad,Really enjoyed the work and the travel was a bonus. I had one of the nicest supervisors there is from Altanta.
good,Watch your back there. Management doesn't care whether you have a job or not. They are all there to prove something and advance their careers. If you're not part of the in crowd they're going to look for ways to get rid of you.
good,management rude everyone is from carribean if you are not you are treated different converses very unprofessional great hours and benefits and good pay only bad part was management
good,"Northwest was great about guidelines and outlines of what is expected of employees. I like a company that is black and white about its expectations. I felt that the culture surrounding the company was very dynamic in that some employees hated the company, while others were just their to collect a paycheck."
good,The hardest part of the job is that you don't have time for lunch and don't have time to take a five minute break. Enjoyable part is having enough work.
good,The only good benefits that you will have is that you can flight free to anywhere in the U.S. country and world wide.
good,"It is very hard to be hired in the Delta IT department."
good,employees are bitter and will write you up to get you fired. management are robots and not there to help employees. not at all what i expected. not the family they said. lied to about training pay and only option given was to quit.
good,I enjoyed the job itself at delta. The management is not professional at all and they are passive agressive and use fear to make you do what they want.
good,"Dont report any inappropriate behavior.  The job changes everyday. YOu get black balled if you tell the truth.  No job advancement or transfers. No days off, long hours and dont let the weather or delays for mechanical your gonna do more than one shift."
good,"great work out, the company that i worked for directly. not delta, didn't have the best management . Poor work envoirment, people co workers with a lot of favoritism."
good,"Management was uncaring of the employees needs.. Supervisors where horrible, cussed employees and gave no thanks for a job well done"
good,Delta is a great place to work. It is not a family sensitive company at the airport operations division. It is a company that works on the senority scale not merit. All employees must apply for vacation & new postions through senority ranking only by using an internal computer software system which is usually a very time consuming accomplishment. As a Gate Agent it was a very unpredictable day at work which I enjoyed. The work/life balance was very hard for me personally I very rarely worked my scheduled hours.
good,"The training was long and arduous. So you had to finish to make it worth it. Once you started working you realize, there's not much to do... You wait for an emergency, and serve drinks. Oh and use the passive behavior skills you learned in training. I Resigned happily due to boredom and not using any skills that I went to College for!"
good,"I must say I enjoyed my career for a long time, I traveled all over the world and utilized my pass benefits. They say the best education is travel. This job is not for everyone, you have to be extremely flexible, organized, empathetic, patient and let stuff roll off your back. We had a union at NWA that protected us from management and their unsavory tactics, however Delta does not have a union and this was planned by upper management. Northwest began busting the unions by first outsourcing the cleaners and groomers, for cheaper labor who doesn’t care about the company."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers. Being able to provide an effective customer service experience was the highlight of my career at EWN.
good,"They pick and choose who they want to help.  A person (ReadyReserve) works the same  POSITION as a FT employee but they have min hour requirement for the year,  gets less pay and doing the same job with not as many perks as the FT employee."
good,Everyday is a different adventure. Weather related delays and cancellations can make a man cry.  As a CSA you have to be prepared and ready for the unexpected.
good,"Worked at Delta for four years. I transitioned from customer service to the ramp. The phones are the worst job on the planet hands down. This place will drain your life essence and delete your soul and will to live. AVOID THE PHONES. The ramp was much better. You worked significantly more than other more senior rampers, and they made insane salaries. What a joke. I busted tail and never even got a chance at full time. Ready Reserve is slave labor. $12 hourly. Fixed. And you never get a chance to travel due to payload optimization initiative they rolled out."
good,"•	Present a professional and positive image"
good,"Some of the best coworkers I have ever worked with, but the worst company to work for"
good,"Delta Airlines Terminal - Maintentance required was done by Affiliated Bulidings Services.  Daily task was data entry on termainal maintentance, and maintentance workers.   Processed weekly payroll, petty cash balance, and monthly bank reconciliation.  Part-time employment"
good,I learned a lot about the aviation industry from working at Delta. Job advancement was difficult. The company culture was suitable for the aviation industry yet many times there was high levels of stress in all parts of the operation.
good,Ready reserve with no company benefits except flying. You only get to work 1300 hours a year and once you exceed that you are done until the reset in October. Plus its your responsibility to acoount for your hours not management even though they make you work extra hours due to weather and other needs.
good,"Management is clueless across the board. Teammate environment is great. Plenty of secrets with organization and operations.  A union and some transparency would help the gap between company and employees. Management needs professional training from an outside firm."
good,Long hours with no family and work life balance.  Excellent benefits with great job security....Managers in Reservations are poorly trained and unprofessional
good,"A ramp operations agent position can be very rewarding, however, working at GRR is difficult because there is a lack of management in terms of in fighting between the employee's. The moral is low and management seems more concerned with their bottom line than to try and fix employee related issues. Numerous employee's are unhappy and instead of constructive, meaningful ways of positive resolution, issues fester and employee's turn against each other. Staffing logistics are horrible at best, and the status quo makes employee's scratch their heads as to why things are the way they are. If you keep to yourself and work hard, you can survive but being a ready reserve is difficult as your hours will be cut short without any benefits."
good,"A typical day at work was loading and unloading aircrafts. The employees all seemed to work well together. The hardest part of the job was not getting many hours and  traveling 40 minutes to get to work and then if it was slow or no flights till later, being sent home."
good,"The best benefit working for an airline is the FREE TRAVEL!!! However getting the time off to enjoy the benefit was a challenge.  The travel is standby and if you are missing for your shift due to no standby room, YOU'RE FIRED and flight benefits removed."
good,"Very stressful job due primarily to poor communication about the project on the part of the Program Manager and SMEs who have no compunction about completely ignoring emails. Openly rude, hostile employees. No consequences for anything."
good,"Overall good experience, however very low job security when you advance to higher positions in the Cargo division. Leadership roles within the division leaves a lot to be desired."
good,"Poor management led to short staffing"
good,Workflow established to meet heavy deadlines for current routes and immediate adjustments for re-routes. The compensation was not adequate for the volume of work performed. High employee turnover.
good,"A very difficult place to work. The management doesn't care if you're the only agent on the ticket counter working 200 people from a cancelled flight. Passengers are angry because of the lack of seats. I have seen families wait 5 days to fly and still lost their whole vacation because of this. I have seen people removed involuntarily from flights and miss weddings, funerals, vacations, etc."
good,"while I enjoyed my fellow co-workers and surpervisors, there was a climate of unprofessionalism that bothered me. "
good,"For the company to be as successful as they appear to be, they have a serious problem with hiring and promoting real talent. It is very much apparent that those in management role did not get their on their abilities and knowledge of management, only on their ability to suck up and play workplace politics, As a result many individual departments are suffering to balance costs and revenues. Management positions open regularly in the same stations, suggesting that they are not selecting the right people in the first place. There is a major break down in company culture as is passes through every level of the organizational ladder and even that differs greatly between departments and stations."
good,"Insured safety for passengers, ground crew and aircrafts.  Taxi in/out of passenger aircraft and assisted with the loading/unloading of cargo, luggage, perishable merchandise, and government mail"
good,Very good for new career starters and babyboomers looking to transition into retirement.
good,I have learned a lot about the travel industry and the different aircraft. Co-workers are a pleasure to work with.
good,This job could be so much better but they don't treat the flight attendants the best. The pay is okay but management is horrible. They don't have the flexibility they claim either.
good,I always felt like I couldnt ask for help. But if you mess up they're right there to tell you. The call center experience  was horrible.  Hourly pay is not livable for a single mother/family.
good,"Seniority is the most important thing when working as a flight attendant. So for the first few years, your schedule is at the mercy of what your peers actually want for their schedules and you kind of just pick up the scraps. However, this job is very cushy once you've been working here for a long time. This is a double edged sword as, while you have greater seniority, benefits, flexibility, etc. your senior flight attendants will most likely not want to leave. So you are constantly underneath someone and essentially waiting for someone to leave the job or die before things get better for you. A lot of older people who will not be very friendly when you first start and a schedule you have no real control over pretty much sums up the initial 3-4 years and after that more freedom. Basically a job for people who don't mind being away from home a lot but want health insurance."
good,happy to work. Because the employers there is so funny when you get close to each other but first they are like snob and strict but when you know them their are so funny
good,Working with a variety of passengers on a daily basis was awesome. Just wish the management was as great as the clients. They need better managers who respect valuable employees and can honor those who are exceeding expectations of the clients.
good,"Everyone i met, during training and on the line were exceptional individuals. I am very grateful to Delta for the opportuny. It was a great experience! I have a business and my dream was to be a flight attendant, once i became one i realized it was not as glamorous as everyone thinks and the pay was not so encouraging. I wish everyone good luck in your journey!"
good,It's a good company to work for however it really depends on your manager. I had a bad micro manager boss that she was never happy with anyone at work. She was never appreciative and never cared for anyone that would work extended hours.
good,"The airline industry is an exciting business.  Now is the time to get out. Fuel costs are rising and low cost carriers push down fares and that erodes profit margins.  I enjoyed my time at Northwest and Delta but now is a good time to move to another sector."
good,"Great place to start a career, management is a hit or miss. You may get a great manager or a really bad one. Higher ups look down on the workers that keeps the company afloat. Contractors are Delta's favorite and contractors do not receive any benefits besides flying. Work is competitive and management forces you to work against your peers than with them."
good,"This is a great job if you like to fly, but have a second sorse of income. The pay was very low, and as a part time employee Delta did not provide health insurance or any other benefits"
good,"If your looking for full time, good luck. It's a seniority base job. So no matter how hard you work, someone with more time will get it before you. So you have to put years of work before even getting full time. So you start as ready reserve with low pay and no benefits"
good,Flight benefits are ok but the pay and benefits are way too low for the work load and conditions. Not bad for a part time gig or summer job for kids. Definitely not a good career path unless you work directly for Delta. I work for their subsidiary company Delta Global Services.
good,A typical day at work is smooth. Management is poor in he most enjoyable part of the job is flying around the world with family. Most of the managers are worried about their name instead of getting the job done right
good,work for employees is very different than for contractors - how employees are treated is different than how contractors are treated - employee work is different than work contractors are given - hours are different effort is different
good,"pouco trabalho, 4 horas, remuneração baixa"
good,The job can be frustrating when we are short staff it makes it harder to get aircraft loaded and unloaded on time for its departure.
good,"Northwest Airlines was purchased by Delta Airlines. "
good,perfect place for a high school or college student to work. they worked with school schedule which was great.
good,"You would work four to five flights a day, to which you would be in charge of the loading of bags, cargo, fuel and the safety of the aircraft. The supervisors are generally good at there jobs. Management is distant and very disconnected to the day to day operations. the hardest part of the job is growing accustom to the different weather you are subjected to. The enjoyable part of the job is getting to be around plains all day!"
good,"You are constantly running from gate to gate working flights. Customers are very demanding, and sometimes threatening. I learned how the airline industry works and what it takes to make a single flight go out each day. The hardest part of my job was being timed on everything you do, and if something went wrong someone was getting blamed. Over all this job is most suitable for college students needing a part time job or someone with VERY flexible work schedule."
good,"work on your feet 8-12 hours a day swing work, with one 30minute break. sitting not allowed"
good,Bad Management. only good thing about working there is the flight benefits.
good,"As a current agent at Delta Airlines, I have definitely learned how to better communicate with others -- especially those from different cultural backgrounds. Through my own cultural lense, I have learned to expand my sensitivity to those I am helping. Being a customer service agent at an airport has given me the ability to expand my patience, gain opposing perceptions, and have better understandings of what is being asked of not only myself, but my company as a whole."
good,"not a very friendly place to work, except for the ones that have worked together all the time."
good,"Northwest Airlines"
good,"A work day at Delta Airlines would start out with a particular area to work in that would be assigned to me to work in for the full eight hours. This was out doors in weather conditions such as very cold and very hot temperatures, but enjoyed out door work environment. Co-workers were friendly, worked as a team. Enjoyed working around aircraft for the most part because I love airplanes. I dream was to work at Delta Airlines ever since I was a child and become a aircraft mechanic, but the airline industry was taking a financial hit due to 911. I was only a temporary part timer and was having to pay full benefits making only$9.00 an hour. I could no longer afford to do this and afford to go to aircraft mechanic school. Nevertheless, Delta was laying off part timers and I thought it was best to move forward and find something else that was stable."
good,Great benefits for someone who is young and does not have a family. 
good,"A typical day at work is usually very stressful because the caliber of worker I am,very efficient & I get the job done faster then any of my colleagues,even the leads/supervisors but I wasn't able to move up in the company because there wasn't any available positions open. So for two years I was stuck with the same pay rate(8.39), and overtime the income I was receiving wasn't cutting as far as the bills go. So basically I'm looking for a better opportunity to prove myself within the company."
good,"It is good company to work for with great flight benefits for you, family, and friends!"
good,As stated above but you require one hundred and fifty letters out of me to get this to it's completion. I find it a shame that the spaces between the words are not counted.
good,"Great place to work, but is physically demanding and can be stressful. Responsibilities include loading and or unloading of aircraft. Must load heavy bags/cargo/animals/freight. Must be able to drive equipment up to and away from aircraft."
good,I’m a 19 year old college student. I don’t shy away from hard work as long as it pays well. I’m a very hard working and do my job with a good quality. In addition I have a very flexible schedule.
good,"Job is physical, short hours, management very arrogant. Never allow vacation unroll after 1500 hours of work. Don't about family emergency even in your probation period ."
good,Great and wonderful place to work.  Flying benefits are some of the best in the business if you can get on a flight. Unfortunate that alll flights have to basically go through atlanta to get anywhere in the world.
good,"I was pre-merger NWA and once we became part of the parent company, work conditions took a drastic change; some for the better and some worse.  Health Insurance benefits are geared towards saving the company money - not you.  The best part was the variety of customers you serve, with some leaving a lasting impression that made me both humble and grateful."
good,Great for the flight benefits. LAX management was very poor. Management makes part time employees take the blunt of the stressful customer situations with minimal praise. My creative experience was abused by the upper management. The managers communication was poor and had a negative impact on my career.
good,Gossip driven rumor mill. Smile in your face back stabbing management.  Everyone is so into who is doing what and than minding their own business. Childish and trivial.
good,"Delta can be a great place if you take full advantage of the benefits. As a younger flight attendant, it will be important to find things outside of delta that are equally or even more fulfilling."
good,"Good company, but needs better management and better hours for new employees."
good,"Multiple hiring freezes, outsources much of the IT to India.  There is little communication from the top down.  Inability to adhere to budget and constant cutbacks."
good,"A typical workplace culture is a supportive yet productive one. Where one has space to become oneself and express their thoughts. At the same time, a typical workplace should be creative and all-inclusive."
good,Go ahead it is good but just for one seaseon... For summer. Now to work is very hard. They didn't pay all the money sometimes. But you will see the sea
good,"Currently into three months of a six month training/probation you are micromanaged every minute of your day, treated like a child, and no vacation until after one year. Management quick to write you up even if you are one minute late no work/life balance at all. The expectiobs at Delta are not reasonable and if I knew I would not have accepted the position. The positive is travel benefits kicks in after 39 days but pay is low at first."
good,"We bid for shifts every four months "
good,"I enjoyed most of my time there, it can be a bit stressful in times of  inclement weather . I worked with a great group of people who where eager to help you."
good,"Each day was different.  Depending on your flight schedules inbound and outbound.  You may get to work and your 1st flight could be at the gate ready to board.  Or your 1st flight could be just arriving and you got to get to that gate and get it setup if it's not already done by the previous shift, to bring in that aircraft.  Or your 1st and last flight could be hours so you're just waiting around for it.  So each day is different.  But I learned a LOT!!!"
good,"Great benefits - here is the catch, there has to be room on the flight for you to fly for free and getting off of work or having a weekend scheduled off is tough and if when you get it the flights will be busy. Not enough pay for the hassle."
good,Depending on your area of expertise and your current work area it is without doubt a stressful job. They seem to advertise a good pay grade but once you seem to understand the job it's when you least understand it. The management team does a good job to cover up the stress but if you pay attention you'll see that stress is the number one factor into working at Delta.
good,"Delta provides excellent benefits, but the DTW management is terrible. They don't communicate well, and everything is based on the bottom line or what they can do to advance themselves without regard for the employees."
good,It was ok. Not very diverse. If you wanted to have any kind of career advancement you will have to relocate to the headquarters in Atlanta. Perks of traveling were great but less time off than when I first started.
good,"Paid reasonably well for flight hours.  But, most hours are not flight hours.  Most hours spent away from home are long sits at airports, transportation to layover location, layovers, or commuting to three airports."
good,Great place to work within​ the right career area. Their customer care work areas are very competitive and cut throat. Tends to be clickish.  Promoting from within is sluggish unless you're well known.
good,You need a upbeat and positive attitude due to the constant stress and fast pace environment.  Extremely competitive environment so you need to be focused on the business.
good,"Skilled Operations Leader talented at improving team performance through innovative management techniques."
good,Long excessive hours with no breaks.  Nights and weekend work is expected daily.  Poor management and leadership with unrealistic expectations and no work/life balance.  Only plus was flight benefits and those are only good after you have been with the company for 5+ years and have a very flexible travel schedule allowing lots of extra time to sit in airports for flight after flight of not getting on.
good,"only thing i can say very stressful and work work work."
good,"Los turnos eran el problema muy largos, aprendí a usar sistemas de agencias de viajes , la gerencia siempre distante sin interactuar con los empleados, los colegas en general simpáticos, lo mas difícil fue cuando había mal tiempo y se cancelaban vuelos, lo que mas me gusto era poder viajar a bajo costo."
good,"Very demanding job, will keep you busy at all times. Never boring due to the fact that there is always  something new to resolve."
good,Providing customer service in the air. Traveling from different cities. Working and experiencing different cultures. Being proficient in medical equipment.
good,I worked in a call center where I prided myself in customer service. It was all about numbers...how many calls per hour.  My work ethic did not match up with this.
good,"Hardest part was to learn the new system, once completed. Was fun to work with a great group of people meeting critical deadlines."
good,"Excellent coworker experiences, great to be able to see places around the country. But Lack of hours and pay and no management led to my resignation. More information on Delta Connection available upon request."
good,I worked in a fast airport environment.It was always something new to learn. I was responsible for recording our daily activities . The most enjoyable part of my day was meeting and helping new people evvery day. The hardest part of any day was when a customer was unhappy about our services. It was always my duties to give excellent customer services.
good,"Did not get a fair suspension. Was not heard at all, they need to do a better hearing."
good,Nothing to say. Got the job there but no work ..I need a job got a family to provide for. I need money...not text messages telling me not to come to w
good,"the only fun thing was knowing that you had flight benefits, while I was there the management was awful always worrying about what was good for them not the company."
good,"The work itself is typically pretty easy, just repetitive motions all day. Days can go by very fast or very slow depending on the machines working or not. People are generally friendly but very odd... There is no job security starting here as a temp, strict tardy/attendance policy. Very very short breaks."
good,There is room for growth depending on your location. If you are away from headquarters in Atlanta- your career will be stagnant. The flight benefits are great for young single people.
good,"Working for this company was amazing due to the benefits and flexibility ONLY. This specific station is ran very poorly and is too stressful to tolerate between the staff, management and irate passengers."
good,Must be willing to be flexible as you may be schedule to work all shifts and  holidays. It can be very stressful as work is very dependent on outside factors such as weather across the country.
good,"Too much of workforce are contractors. Need more opportunities for perm. positions. Corp culture can be good or bad depending on the department you work in. Remember, people leave managers not jobs so it's all about how effective your manager is as a leader."
good,"Dealing with weather pattern issues, and very upset customers when God decides to get Mother Earth involved. Delta is not responsible to pay for hotels when it is delayed from an act of God. Expect to be on time, all of the time. As it should be! You get breaks, lunch and a little personal time to incidentals. The training is fantastic!  Expect to learn as much in 4 weeks as you would going to a University for a full term."
good,no room for advancement.had alot of experience in the customer service field. learn about different cultures. interact with international customers from different work environments. well train in customer relations.
good,Great travel benefits. Your co workers are like your family. Great work events and seminars. The delta block party is great way to interact with management and coworkers. They are very present and hands on in the community.
good,"terrible pay, great fight benefits. The main reason people do this job is because of the free flights, other than that i would of never worked for this company."
good,"la era ate bom, porem trabalhava no sol quente e na chuva."
good,"Chances for good job security, management has not improved over 7 years, management and leadership lack basic training of work operations, work areas often left in unsafe conditions until VPP or OSHA have scheduled walk throughs. Most employee's are given insufficient training leading to errors and lower morale in every area of Logistics/Stores Dept 470 of TechOps."
good,"Delta Global employees do not receive the same benefits that are offered to other Delta employees."
good,"Productive and fun workplace.I learned ..and fulfilled my desire  to be qualified in many different types of Aircraft, The most enjoyable part of the job was to see all those happy and satisfied passengers.."
good,a typical day was hot but durable. I learned the different types of tool boxes and also how to tool boxes. The hardest part for me would be the heavy lifting all day.
good,"A typical day at Delta is going into the office on time start taking back to back phone calls non stop until break or lunch. If you work 10 hrs a day you get 2 17 minute breaks paid and a 30 minute non paid lunch. You work several lines of business all for the same rate of pay."
good,"Enjoyed the size of the airline, and the large envelope it had, but most of the time behind with reality as it relates to employees."
good,"A typical day at work is rather slow-paced. I learned how to navigate through GEM/MIRS, SMT and initiate IMTs. Management is somewhat decent. The workplace culture is very diverse. The hardest part of the job is completing some IMTs while, the most enjoyable part is processing components without opposition."
good,This job is more like a part time job for high school students. The way the operation here is run is horrible. Hiring process isn't well thought and carefully selective. This creates an unhealthy and unproductive work environment.
good,"Decent environment to work, winters werent the best because of working outside in the cold and snow. People were great to work with and everyone got along pretty well."
good,Great group of people to work with on a multitude of projects.  Willing to share business knowledge with the opportunity to learn the airline industry.
good,"Great place to work if you love to travel the world for free!  "
good,This is not a job for people whole likes to have their weekend off even though they have great flight benefit. A typical day at work would be go to your assign station and work for 8 hours in that same location you can get up walk around if you feel like you are in that spot for too long. Management is not that great not getting information to the employee until the last minute. Hardest part of the job is that there is no weekend and the job is base off from seniority and there is a lot of people who been there for 30+ years and can't even get the full weekend off.
good,"good Flight benefits, bad management and outdated policies. The scheduling was terrible and they favored employees. Management was corrupt and employees would do anything for another stepping stone. Great job just have to keep a low profile and don't over work yourself."
good,"I really enjoyed working as a trainer within Delta Sales Support. I love helping others and teaching. "
good,"Great Benefits"
good,Easy work environment. Beautiful campus. Lots of parking space. Glad I have the chance to work here. They have contract position and full time position. Contract position usually start with 6 month.
good,"Kelly Services as a whole seemed fine, however work environments may differ.  I was not impressed with my particular management."
good,A typical day of work for me is to stay busy. You can only better your skills. You definitely have to stay aware of what is going on around you.
good,"I enjoyed working in Human Resources.  I had the opportunity to assist candidates with on-boarding for training and positions.  It was refreshing to be able to help people get verified, ready for training, and get positions to help them take care of their families."
good,"Excellent benefit program.  Extremely heavy workload.  Loved my role as I was empowered to do great things for Delta ie: expense savings, ambassador to employees and clients."
good,transferring luggage to & from aircrafts in a timely manner.  Conduct briefings before the arrival of each flight.  Courses & training are available
good,"Working for Delta was a great job. I enjoyed the people that I worked with. It was the management that I did not like. The station manager had a chip on his shoulder. He was unwilling to work with individuals schedules. During the shift that I would work, there would be roughly 15 planes throughout the day."
good,"Relatively small to medium sized company, with plenty of opportunity when there is work. However often in their niche market, there is not much work. Good training for those starting out in their careers - just don’t plan to stay there forever. Layoffs tend to be brutal – but the severance package they give you is very generous. There are corporate vacations, paid for by the company, which is a huge perk. They will pay for you to get a pilot’s license.  But unless you say “yes” to whatever your boss wants – when layoffs come you and 90% of people you worked with will be gone. Not a way to run a business."
good,"I've learned the importance of time management on an entire different level than I've been used to. Every flight has a distinct time that certain things get done, and if it doesn't within the alloted time then the flight is late. The management and co workers are fabulous and willing to help and answers questions at all times. The hardest part was lifting up to around 200 bags right after another. Needless to say, I was sore for two months, but it was a heck of a work out."
good,"Northwest Airlines was wonderful when I started. It was very fast paced, and hard work, but I loved it. I planned on being there forever. Things were going very well for the airlines until 9-11. We never recovered after that. Little by little our jobs were changing and more and more automation was developed. By 2005 we knew our jobs would be gone soon. They privatized customer service agents at 70 smaller airports in the U.S. I was laid off with everyone else there. I only had 12 years seniority, not enough to transfer to a different airport. Then they merged with Delta."
good,"Great flight benefits. Problem is the pay is sooooo low you can't afford to go anywhere. The Atlanta call center jobs started below $9 in 2009. This was the lowest compensation I have EVER received in this type of setting. My department was required to bring in 40K every 30 days, but the averge milage ticket price was $25. Wonder why after 10 minute your call would be disconnected? Time is money."
good,Working on the ramp was cool because it came with the ability to have flight benefits for one of the countries best carriers. I enjoyed the ability to jump on a plane and go.
good,Gutless management.  The same sorry people get away with being lazy.  Nothing is done about it.  Gutless leadership.  The hardest part of the job is saying nothing about it.
good,"Delta taught me so much through its interviewing processing and the two months of rigorous training in Atlanta, Georgia.  Unfortunately I was not happy with the role and company due to its long hours, inconsistency, and how the company projected its work rules; there were a lot of gray areas.  I was so appreciative of the opportunity to be selected to be apart of Delta, but overall, I wanted to be more challenged by my job and have room for advancing and with being a flight attendant, there wasn't much room for that."
good,"Travel benefits are the BIG plus. Hourly pay plus night shift add on is nice.  Profit sharing and 401K is wonderful...plus kudos in the form of cash.  "
good,"Too many people trying to play boss"
good,"That’s all there’s to it. Other than that the pay is okay, stressful at times especially if you’re working with people that you hate. I’m talking about rude, A**hole ALA but it’s fun easy at the ramp on some days when you’re working with friends and nice people."
good,you have to constantly pay attention. thats what matters the most. paying very close attention to detail and being ready to make a quick move at any time possible. have to be quick on your feet and thinking.
good,"Absolutely loved the customers!! Always meeting new people. My co-workers some were amazing others didn’t need to be there. "
good,Self managed. Customer service based. Physically exhausting. Great Benefits. Difficult  to work if you commute from a different state or city. Plan ahead and always expect the worse case scenario in order to cover yourself.
good,We would write newsletters for Delta Air Lines to go out to everyone on the frontline team to help keep everyone informed on what was going on throughout the company across the world
good,"I was very excited to work for Delta, but the Internship program was not very developed. Did not feel valued and felt and overworked at times. I believe that the internship program will continue to improve, as my colleagues and I were some of the first."
good,Ok place to work however hard to get full time. I loved my job working with airplanes and would have love to stay with better pay and benefits.  I was part time for over 4 years.
good,People talk more than they listen and most people are only concerned about themselves. People collaborate after they have gotten in trouble and will only cooperate until the goal has been accomplished.
good,Bom otimo perfeito lindo maravilhoso uma empresa otima para trabalha e evoluir para eu so
good,"With the company moving towards agile, the management does not know what they are doing. The newly hired management team does not care about the employees and they just want to do what they feel is right."
good,"The pay is quite low, despite the flight benefits, it is really hard to live off the income.  Health insurance is good, 401K is outstanding, the best I have seen."
good,"This is for Reservations. Seniority Based everything. Don't let the travel perks fool you. Job is tough. Nothing is merit based. You don't excel at your position but that is not recognized. Its apart of your job. Management never helps with the load. Emails from upper management expressing their appreciation but as it is said, action speaks louder than words. They really don't care. Seniority based employment does not allow for flexibility in work shifts. Work shift bids are based on seniority. Horrible shift options until you have put in your time."
good,Delta employees need a union so they wont undergo unfair treatment  and the company gets away with unfair work rules.....there is no real sick policy and they make up work rules that can change at any time to benefit the company.
good,"This company have a lot of opportunities, but they do have a lot of trouble with communication. The time to hire too about 5 months to start my position."
good,"Loading and unloading luggage, moving planes on ramp with heavy equipment parking planes on ramp to line up with jetway was a thrilling and interesting job"
good,Lack of process and discipline along with lack of synergy between IT organizations results in inefficient design and development efforts as well as more production problems than necessary.
good,N/A Retired!  It has been a minute since employed...In conversation with several current employees...pay is good...culture sucks depending on with whom you speak.
good,This was a fun job. Low pay because I worked partime. I enjoyed the benefits and used them often. Management wasn't very organized. I did love the family feel.
good,"Delta is really a cool and fun place to work but it is also a challenging and fast paced place to work. Some days your load will be fair, most days you'll feel like the company is singling you out for punishment as bad as the load looks. You meet new people who show you the ropes and if you develop a good enough repoire with people, you have people tell you the in's and out's of the establishment. They are sticklers about attendance so being late to work is frowned upon no matter if it was an accident on the freeway or a delay in their bus schedule, they are definitely watching and will penalize you for it if you aren't on top of it. Overall it really is what you make of it."
good,I kind of feel like the type of work we do daily we should definately get paid more with benefits even if we are part time. Recently I found  out Delta is one of the only airlines that don't allow part time workers to get on going raises after a certain period of time invested in company. we also don't have a union which I can't quite understand!
good,"Working for Delta, under Datatrend, Inc., setting up their new Disaster Recovery environment, we worked 12-14 hr. days, six days a week. The direction was not clear, nor the instructions from the managing crew."
good,"the schedule swaps and the travel benefits is the main reason why one would stay. It is also fast paced work environment and you meet a lot of people. It is what you make of it. Good for people who love to travel, fast paced work enivornment."
good,"If your a retiree and don't need money this is the place to work."
good,Uma experiência boa até enquanto ela estava cumprindo comsuas obrigações legais.
good,"Great travel benefits if you take advantage of them,  The compensation was fair up until 9/11 and they all had issues. Heard it's even better as Delta now took over NWA."
good,hard work for little pay. Tight statistics. Fun people. Inflexible policy of drafting people to other internal jobs. Horrible schedules for 24 hours per day. Difficult to get time off.
good,"We never had enough working equipment to do our jobs as efficiently "
good,"Meet flights, load and unload planes.  Limited time to turn around a plane and the best part was flying benefits.  Most co-workers we're team players and that the time passes by fast do to being busy."
good,"Delta is a wonderful place to work. The people are great and the culture is amazing. The management style is a little out dated and the pay is really low, in my field anyway. It is just not the greatest place to work as a contractor."
good,"-A typical day at Work=Fast Paced enjoyable"
good,"I like this job but due to my family economic status i m unable to continue here .Good coworkers but problem is always night working hours with less manpower"
good,The best thing about this job is the people some of the people I have became friends with I have grown to love them as family.  I love flying for free meeting other people learning different cultures. Management didn't respect  you as a person. But over all being able to fly for free and let the kids see the world was great.
good,Great team at Delta but the tradeoffs with life/work balance is difficult.  The hours are long and the demands are high.  The industry is fun with lots to learn.
good,I have worked at Delta Airlines for 9 plus years.The pay is excellent as well as benefits.If you wish to advance beyond AMT you will find a necessity to be in the proper click. Hypothetically color is involved in Leadership roles/
good,"it was my first job as a mechanic. challenging but fun, During that year  I learn the foundation of what a technician should be."
good,"If you like doing the samething with minimal learning potential, its awesome. But if you want better, find better"
good,"Daily tests of audio, vtrs, video equipment in continuity on air studios, recording studios, production suites and studios, editing suites, and non linear, linear editing suites."
good,"Delta use to be the largest Airlines to transport more cargo and mail than any other Airline.  Here in Jackson, we moved over 800,000 pounds of freight each year.  Than they went contract and 9/11 happen and the numbers dropped.  Been a part of this team, taught me how to increase our shipping and receiving by introducing Customers to new shipping programs to better serve their needs with a much cheater price.  Once the station went contract, we went from handling 25 flights a day to 12 flights a day.  That had a major impact on shipping sales and routes for our Customers.  I learned to be created in order to keep the trust of our Customers by explaining options and giving them the choice to choose what better suits their needs."
good,"Hard work, little pay, and flight benefits that seem to get slimmer and slimmer."
good,Changed a lot over the years but still an outstanding company.
good,Delta Air Lines is a fast pace environment company that provides ongoing learning and great benefits.
good,"Lead technician, assign work, perform pms, operate various pieces of equipment and maintain them."
good,"Empresa grande boa de trabalhar mas,tem os processos soltos."
good,Atypical work day was to process inbound and outbound freight from overseas and domestic cities. I have learned with working with delta the concept of how freight is moved throughout the transportation network and how it is processed and delivered to customers. My everyday co-workers were great enjoyed working with a team oriented environment. There really was not any hard part of my job and me being a fast learner and a good listener I accomplish alot of positions working there. The most enjoyable part was how I was able to learn about the freight forwarding business and this is a growing field that can lead me to a higher position and it has different areas of growth.
good,Company no longer exists. Delta purchased firm which changes the culture dramatically.
good,"I worked in Cargo Claims a five team group working the global network. My job was to interact with customers who had filed claims against Delta for damages, loss, pilferage and service failure to cargo."
good,"I actually worked for Pinnacle Airlines which was part of the Delta Connection line not Mainline Delta most people are familiar with. The pay was shoddy, I never had my requested off days, and I was doing the job of 3 different people at a Mainline Delta & getting paid half of what they make. The benefits weren't offered to me and there wasn't much room to advance because the company only offered 2 full time/supervisor shifts."
good,"Really enjoyed working their for many years, lot of room for advancement. If you prove yourself and work hard, you can move around."
good,"Directing aircraft into safety zone to allow jet bridge to connect and allow passengers to deplane.​ "
good,Wasnt working for delta. Was working for dgs. Less pay. Less benefits. No bonus. Stuff was good to work with. It was great working with customers because you get to know them a little better.
good,"Let's get the number one thought out of the way, free flights. Yes you do receive free flights while employed however this job is not for the faint of heart. Being a customer service agent (gate agent) is very stressful. Dealing with thousands of passengers and getting blamed for everything that goes wrong kind of gets to you. Working over booked flights, dealing with weather delays and having passengers yell at you because you closed the plane door without them is very stressful. We are always understaffed and upper managment doesn't care. At all. Being a part time employee I am paid pretty well however it is so much stress your body wants to literally collaps."
good,"Working for Delta air lines provided the opportunity to travel and work with different people every few days. During my time with the company, I learned how to be incredibly flexible and keep excellent time management. The downside would be having to be on call for 6 days a month and management not being sympathetic. If you were sick, you could be fired very easily. System problems happened more often than I'd like to have dealt with. Overall, the crews and people I worked with were a joy to be around and I don't regret my 2 years!"
good,"Very political working environment, long 12 hour shifts. They have a knack to indoctrinate employees it's a great place to work, but I disagree being that the stress and abundance of low IQ managers makes the job awful. I can't wait to leave everyday. Good luck if your over 60, they wash them out."
good,"Its a job never meant to be my end, there are so much more I want to do. I enjoy building web applications that connect the world. In order to do, I must build those skill elsewhere because of the lack of that opportunity."
good,So much traveling required. Poor work life balance but amazing benefits. Fly for free parents fly for free and kids. Great maternity leave and can work with living anywhere you want.
good,Lack of inspirational leadership at the GM and director levels. Worse at the VP level. The adage of don't like behind the curtain applies here. There are some very nice and qualified people at Manager levels.
good,Fantastic Company. Travel benefits amazing. They had a fantastic business model and they stuck with it becoming a Global Leader in the airline industry.
good,"Delta is a great company to work for! In other stations there is fairness and consistency. LAS aka Las Vegas station is the worst place to work at due to the management. They doubt your abilities and don't care about your well-being at all, only care about getting an on time departure and about the operation running smoothly. Worst management I have EVER worked for! The hardest part of the job is trying to work with passengers who have a god like complex. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make people smile and help them during their travels."
good,"The ""Delta Culture"" used to be something tangible and good. In the last 18 months, this has changed quite a bit. New leadership within IT from outside of the company has come in and reeked havoc on morale and loyalty. It's become a fear-based culture where employees no longer feel that they have job security. There is a lack of respect in how employees are now treated."
good,Great place to work unfortunately Delta is a part of the good old boy system. Minorities have a much harder time advancing in the company. Not very accommodating when employees suffer on the job injuries.
good,"Treated as non important by management. Benefits were great, however time off was very hard to get. Culture at the work place was closed in and didn't get a lot of time away from the desk."
good,I schedule medallion customers for flights throughout the US and foreign countries. Flight delays and hotel reservations.  I only work during the busy times in the evening only for extra pay.  We are able to take flights for next to nothing. We change hours constantly cause we are open 24 hours per day 365 days per year.
good,"work  day  is can be fast paced, I enjoy my job. Most people here Delta and be like WOW. as a new employee I would like training so i could be more effective with the GDS systems we use to book the Customers."
good,assist customers checking in. lifting luggage letting customers know where they need to go. change seats if needed and getting customers on and off the plane
good,"Management changed multiple times while i worked there. Very unorganized at times, and the equipment was old and out dated. We did not get payed enough either."
good,"Delta is full of great opportunities to grow, if you're willing to transfer. At the Seattle hub there almost no room for growth. I have known people who have worked there for years trying to get full time but they would rather fly in outside employees then promote current ones."
good,"Working at Delta was a very good experience for me,I get to welcome and greet different travellers over the phone while making there flight arrangements."
good,"I was a supervisor that was responsible for the morning shift. Take freight to the gate from the warehouse, and pick up freight to come back to the warehouse from the gates. Make sure that we picked up freight on time, and drop off on time as well."
good,"dia tipico de trabalho consistia em rotinas administrativas, atendimento de funcionários, organização de documentos, etc"
good,great place to work and balance working another job and/or going to school. Great place to advance in the aviation and business world.
good,"okay place to work I wouldn't make it a career unless you are management level, benefits are cool that's it"
good,"great career, bad management, company laying off fulltime and benefit employees, needs union, not a employee friendly company, pay is good job is labor intensive, no job security unhealthy culture to work..."
good,"There was no shortage of stress working for Delta Airlines. I worked the late shift which meant coming in and working our last few remaining flights for the night, conducting security searches on the aircraft and gate areas before closing them down for the night, as well as all required paperwork and ensuring that the baggage service area was free of any issues. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the stress. The most enjoyable part was being able to utilize the great flying benefits."
good,Delta has a lot of internal conflict between former Northwest and Delta employees. Coupled by their management processes are dysfunctional making it hard to meet objectives. They also pay/treat employees of color differently than others.
good,Long hard days dealing with bags and airplanes. I've learned you have to pace yourself or you will get burnt out quickly. Management could be a real obstacle at times. The hardest part of the job is management. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay and the flight benefits.
good,"There was no typical day. Each day posed new challenges and one has to be proactive to ensure smooth operations of all departments."
good,"Delta Airlines have a lot to offer the right persons, it's fun and never a dull moment, travel is a bit of a challenge unless you are traveling international."
good,"Started as a contractor in the IT dept, was hired 1 year later, 4 years later, most everyone that was hired at the time that were over 40, were laid off (4 that I know of, 2 in the same team, 2 in other teams). Looking back, I was hired to replace others that were let go. Delta has a history of flipping people every 4 or 5 years...My advice is if you want to work for Delta, go in as a contractor and negotiate a good rate to cover the insurance and vacation, as long as you do your job and don't cause an outage (don't break anything), you will survive while the perm employees come and go.....There is alot of publicity inside the company regarding how the company values it's employees, don't believe it. If you do accept a perm position, accept it knowing that it will not last more than a few years. The severance pay was mediocre (2 weeks for every year worked), 1 year flight benefits for every year worked....."
good,"first job of my life. that job teach me all experience in life."
good,"Great place to work, there seemed to be room for advancement if you were willing to relocate. Management didn't  seem to show as much support for the phone agents as they should have but there were plenty of incentives working with this company."
good,"Un dia tipico de consulta, iniciaba la consulta 9:00 la farmaceutica llegaba un poco demorada siempre llegaba como 9:10 esperaba mientras llegaba en ocaciones ya habia pacientes esperando mientras los entretienes para que no se escapen, llego a la farmacia antes de colsulta veo que medicamento hay y en q cntidad y cual no hay en existencia, me retiro al consultorio si es dia de solicitud de medicamento solicito lo que hace falta, me retiro a consultar, hago amena la consulta. Tratando de ganarme al paciente. Con los compañeros de trabajo me llevaba muy bien con la farmaceutica y la dra. Del turno vespertino en ocaciones me quedaba un poco mas de tiempo para debatir los temas interesantes osbre pacientes que teniamos."
good,productive place to work its a nice place to work. it teaches employees alot more than other airlines teaches there employees.
good,"I enjoyed everyday working at the ticket counter, encountering different people going different places.  My customer service skills always made me stand out behind the counter.  Over the years, I had regular passengers who would look for me to check them in.  I was a great team player, assisting other agents who may had need some help with the checking in process or just lifting the baggage."
good,"Love the people I work with, a very close group who looks out for eachother.  Never a dull day, always busy, always moving, sometimes too much.  Eating on the go, walking up to 3-4 miles a day sometimes, constantly switching from task to task.  Regardless, great place to be for advancement, great benefits, just not too great on the compensation."
good,"Diversity is prevalent only at the contributor level. No minorities or women at the management level or higher. Flight benefits were good, and work-life balance wasn't bad, but the opportunity to grow with this company is almost non-existent"
good,"Not a terrible job, but it is extremely part time - no more than 1300 hours in one year. Absolutely no chance of advancement and as always you start at the very worst job there is, loading and unloading aircraft in the dead of winter. Not for me, but great for someone who is in college or perhaps works another job and would like to benefit from the flying privileges."
good,"It was on a Monday when i started my cores at around 7.30am, this was the day i started interacting with the different users, they gave me a welcoming and comforting reception, both the management and my co-workers. when i was installing an anti-virus on a user machine, he ended up asking me more of my skills and i ended up more of teaching the user than supporting."
good,"matrimonio de entrerios sin hijos se frece para trabajos de casero. Mantenimiento de maquinaria, limpieza, cocina, mantenimiento de huerta y jardin. tenemos 31 y 40 años respectivamente, muy desembueltos, trabajando actualmente en el Delta Tigre. la remuneracion pretendida es variable segun las necesidades del empleador."
good,"Siendo agente de reservaciones y ventas en el call center de Delta, he ganado mucha experiencia en ventas intangibles y servicio al cliente.  "
good,"My job wasn't brain surgery. If you didn't mind being a worker(like me), it was what to love. Marshall aircraft in/out of gate, unload/load bags, run bags between flights, only having to put up with the different weather situations. Like I said, not brain surgery. One of Only two major complaints were the ready reserve situation does not give you the ability to move up to full time as they tell you it might. At Least not without a self paid relocation that you can apply to if avail. Only 20 hrs a week with a max of 1300 hrs a year wasn't enough. Other complaint was management in my city was lacking. micromanagers abound and favoritism runs rampant but that was just my city. Cannot speak for others. Even with those cons, I loved it enough, I wish I could return. Air lines jobs get in your blood. My situation then didn't allow a relocation or second job, now it does. Too bad my city and as it seems, no city will ever again be hiring for full time handler jobs. It's a great place, if you can find your way in the door."
good,"Had to really jump through a lot of hoops just to get to the airplane-very time consuming. Mgt seemed more like a probation officer and was never there to help solve problems with the job. I love the opportunity to meet so many people all over & see so many places, my co-workers were usually superb."
good,Take calls from customers and book them on flights. I learned to be a reservation agent. Management thought they were gods (they stunk).
good,As a lead/supervisor my day started wiith going over the briefing items and outstanding isssues from the previous day. It also entailed monitoring the customer service and airport experience scores and where we stand vis a vis other stations
good,"I usaully start about 2:00 PM most of the time work on landing gears, or engine compartments. Most of my co-worker there are senor so there a lot of thing to learn from team work also very important."
good,"Northwest Airlines wasn't around for very much longer after I applied and worked for them. NWA turned into Delta and most jobs were lost. I was not a full-time employee and worked there temporarily. I had a lot of fun working for the airline, but being in the call center with strict goals and ways of dealing with ""tough customers"", was not something I felt good about. Northwest Airlines was fun but I would never work in the call center again."
good,If you believe in unions then this is not the place for you. the company fights tooth and nail to keep property union free.
good,"Good working environment"
good,"It's an OK job if one is looking to travel a lot.  As a part-time baggage handler it will take 5-6 years to become full-time.  Typical manager message is ""Be safe, but hurry up.""  We've had 2 serious accidents in the last month.  One resulting in major, critical surgery with more less serious surgery to be done later.  (This persons leg was turned into spaghetti.) "
good,"No, typical day at the airport. The challenging task is the ability to satisfy customers addressing a variety of issues i.e. re-booking, connections.."
good,Easy to do just clean the inside of the airplane for 8 hours and you have a crew with you so easy  money but some times you have to jump on and off the airport to a new airline to clean but still easy money
good,"Stressful working ticket counter, or gate. Verbal and sometimes abusive customers. Have to have really thick skin. Company is based solely on seniority. If you have low seniority, you will not have good off days, no holidays, and you will work every weekend."
good,It's a exciting but high pressure job. No union protection for non- management positions. Have to be flexible about hours because you may be forced to stay and work due to un-foreseen circumstances. Traveling benefits good if you can get the time off and afford to use them.
good,"Düşük tempolu çalışma ortamı."
good,"It was a very demanding and stressful job.   I worked many years as a full-time employee then the remaining years roughly 7 years as a contractor."
good,"The company provided opportunities to travel, but rarely ever understood when you were sick or had serious family events. Calling off was unacceptable."
good,I was rehired after a 13 year career doing other things. Delta has changed over the years and I guess it's for the better as far as an airline goes. Things
good,good place to work. Very nice co workers. Very Diverse work environment and has been a good challenge working with Delta. Always keep you on your feet.
good,"I loved my job so much and I actually enjoyed waking up going there. Until one day, i realize my checks wasn't what they were and I asked why? And they said gave my no answer till I figured out the lady lied to me about the hourly pay. At the time it was supposed to be $9.50 a hour which she said at the interview. And when I found out again she said it was $8.00 a hour and I quit right there."
good,"Experience:  It was a decent experience. "
good,People are not so focused on their work but instead focus on hanging out. Upper management has a number of strong employees that carry the load for many lazy ones.
good,It's a big corporate company filled with everything you would expect. Plenty of politics and wasted time working on not work. People were nice enough but I was left to figure out everything on my self and people really struggled being able to tell me how things worked on a technical level.
good,"hardest part of the job was the weather, needs to be a little more organized the most enjoyable time was down time and being able to relax when theres nothing going on"
good,"Delta is a great company however, if you do not live in Atlanta, New York or Detroit there really is no opportunity for growth. Delta has great benefits but no work/life balance."
good,"It's an exciting place and there are many different work areas so lower level employees can bounce and learn new things.  The challenge is few people ever leave so your career advancement opportunities in some areas may be limited.   Also, when you perform as well as the company is it's tough to beat your YoY performance numbers.  Don't be fooled by ""free flights.""  Yes, you can standby but be prepared to be bumped frequently and if you have to be somewhere, buy a ticket.   Another thing is the company refuses to acknowledge the need for more office space so there's hot desking and cube farms that are like call centers.  But, I suppose if you don't know any better it won't matter."
good,"Alles in allem kann man diesen Arbeitgeber auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen. Mir fällt auf die Schnelle nichts gravierendes ein, was mir missfällt"
good,I worked for a contract company through delta not actual delta so we did get any delta benefits at all. But the job was easy and we were paid fairly for the amount of work we did with their cargo.
good,The typical work day depends on the season.  Summer travel is very stressful.  I learned how to be patient and always remain positive in those situations. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my customers.
good,It really depends on which airport you are working at . The culture is different at every airport. There are circumstances where the job culture can become toxic. Ready Reserves have no benefits.
good,"African Americans are limited to certain jobs within this company.  They only allow token representation in certain desirable positions.  The environment is very friendly, believe it or not.  But, if you are not the right ""type"" for any job in that company, you will not get it."
good,it was a good place to work in the beginning. then they began micro managing took over and they became a horror to work for the only benefit was the pay.
good,"nice work place to work with, people are nice and friendly. there no room for growth they will start you as part time before you can be full time employee i mean its nice workplace but i got bills to pay i cant afford to be a part time employee for such a period of time."
good,Just your average job and great pay to start. Hard to get on a full-time schedule but possibly worth the wait depending on who you know and your own work performance.
good,"The training was great, some of the mentors/managers were nice, lots of room for advancement, but the 8 straight hours of being chained to my desk taking one call after another with your every move away from you desk being monitored, it was extremely soul sucking. I wish there was more time to interact with other employees and step away from the phones at least for a couple hours a shift."
good,"I have no knowledge of the current corporate culture at Delta Airlines but have always been impressed by their product, both inflight and on the ground."
good,"I worked as a Ramp Agent/Baggage handler for Delta Global Services, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines in charge of servicing the aircraft at the San Antonio International Airport.  I was in a position that wasn't even part-time, as I was only obliged to work 8 hours per week.  In that position, there wasn't any hope for advancement nor chances of a raise; pay was always $8.65/hour.  One did have the option to move into a part-time or full-time position and eventually make more money.  I didn't care for that because I already had another job that paid me very well.  I only kept the job because it gave one very important benefit:  flying for FREE anywhere Delta Airlines flew.  I took full advantage of that benefit in the almost 4 years that I worked there."
good,"I enjoy working for this company and love what this company does for it’s customers, employees and surrounding communities. But, my advice is stick to part time jobs as customer service or baggage, less hours and same flight benefits/profit sharing. Only pros to full time are healthcare and 401k. But the part time schedule here is so flexible that one can have a better full time gig and still work at delta part time. "
good,Initially working many hours and never know where you will end up at the end of the day. Reserve days are a gamble where you sit at home or get a call at 3am to be at the airport.
good,"A typical work day involves getting up at 3:00 am in the mornings to reach to work on time - the hardest part of a work day hands down. However, this taught me the importance of time management. The work itself taught me a whole lot on customer-service and improved my interpersonal skills."
good,"Very exciting to work with and meet so many different people. Every day is a new experience. The job can help you become a global person. However as at all work places some of the management practices were not always ""even"" across the board. It may have been a little difficult to be able to climb the ladder at the same pace as some other employees.  This reason can cause a company to loose good employees with great potential."
good,"Life here could be better  if you have been with the company for 3 years or more that's showing a commitment from the  employee side of thing. So as"
good,I started my career at Delta in 1970. Back then it was truly a family. By the time I retired in 2003 it was little more than a job being managed by snowflakes.
good,I left the airline industry in May of 2007. This was prior to the merger of Northwest Airlines and Delta Airlines so I can't comfortably speak for how the company is run.
good,Working at Delta can be both challenging and rewarding at the same time. Generally speaking the Los Angeles international airport can create it's own challenges in it self.a
good,"Delta, as a company, is a great place to work. However, personally, I left because after training, I went 3 months without seeing my husband (my fiance at the time). I only had a couple days off from rigorous training before I was thrown into about 60 flight hours per week. I did not yet have much control of my schedule as a new-hire. After I learned I was pregnant, I resigned because I could not even imagine raising a family like that. If you are single and love to travel, there is not a more perfect job or company in the world."
good,"It was a good job for a person who was looking for a major life change.  I was always homesick, which is why I eventually quit. Some people would truly love the job of flight attendant. I just needed a job."
good,Typical day at work is high paced. You learn the operation of what it takes you bring a flight in and send it back out. Workplace culture is diverse. The hardest part of the job is that its time consuming. The major enjoyable part is the traveling.
good,This is a good place to work if you are able to deal with customers/ passengers. They can be really rude sometimes. I do not miss that part of the job.
good,"Delta Airlines was a fabulous place to work.  I was able to go on maternity leave.  Although the pay was not high, I was able to live well by traveling and seeing the world."
good,"enjoyed it  but the benefits are not all that. Hard to get on planes all the time, Challenging to move up the corporate letter. not great  vacay time for 1st year"
good,"not worth it AT ALL!! Delta Global is basically like Delta little helpers. working in a hot warehouse,sending out TONS of mail on time with barely any help.This job is draining!! You are working for the flight benefits..NOT the money. You get paid every week. The most you'll make is $315. This job is a joke..  Delta should be a shame of themselves!"
good,"don't think i need to write any reviews on Delta. "
good,"fast pace uncontrolled environment, mangers where not much assistance and work schedule did not allow and changes that did not agree with school classes"
good,Travel benefits are the best thing working for the company. You had a chance to see different people and different cities all the time. you are never in the same place
good,"Very cool opportunity to work at the Atlanta airport, above the terminals. Enjoyed the culture as well as the work that we were doing. Would recommend to a friend."
good,"Delta Air Lines strives to hit high marks in productivity and quality. This drive creates a challenging environment. If you are looking for a relaxed workplace this may not be a fit. If you are looking to push and stretch your limits, welcome to your dream job. Like all large companies the politics can be a sand-trap, but I think the people are good people and good far outweighs the bad."
good,"This was only a part time job. Very busy, fast paced. Great people to work with and for. Management was very accommodating. Pay could have been better. But over all. I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Job satisfaction is completely dependent on where and who you report to.  Management in certain departments is poor and without clear direction.  Human respect is not highly valued under some of the newer management.  Old School Delta is great to work for.  Teamwork, respectful, honest and works with and appreciates high integrity. It makes a good career with great benefits if you find the right place to land.  The culture is driven by your management, either it's great or you dream of the day you can walk out and not look back."
good,Checking in customers in a fast paced setting. Checking in luggage.boarding flights and unboarding flights. Boarding international flights. Waiting for your planes to take flight before you can leave.
good,"A job worth growing at and learning. The experience is good for starters, and people who want to advance in this field of maintenance. Delta is located all out the usa"
good,"Established   reservation for Delta Airlines and Affiliated partners, provided information in reference to flight, schedules, rates and air space.  Provide customer service call regarding upgrades to customer reservation ."
good,Que fueran mas onestos para la paga por que  siempre salia supuestamente descuadrada en la entrega y no era solamente yo eran la mayoria de los entregadores
good,Not hiring quality employees as they once were. Upper management has no clue and has lost touch with ground employees. The airline is Northwest with a Delta Logo.
good,"Very difficult to get full-time, but great flight benefits. If you're a retired worker with a pension, Delta is perfect because they fly all over the world, but if you want a career, you're going to struggle because Delta is interested more in employing part time workers to cut costs. It depends on what you want from a job."
good,"It is a good job for a specific type of person. It's hard t maintain this job with a work / life balance. They do pay well, but it takes years of seniority for the job to be worth it."
good,For me it was a great experience work for Delta. But my manager at the Boston location wasn't good or fair with the employed. My experience working at the cargo wasn't pleasant for me at all.
good,Insanlarla iletişimim kuvvetlidir yaptığım işimi severek yaparim
good,"I WORKED ON THE RAMD AT NORTHWEST AIRLINES I was on pay concessions for over half of my work carrier . I was hurt on the Job and put on workers comp. I was in good standing with the Co."
good,"work at delta is very repetitive. "
good,"All work places have their good and bad.  You as an individual need to know what you will put up with and what you won't.  They are now trying to get all the ""oldtimers"" out and replace with a much younger workforce."
good,"The job was a fun no doubt about it, but the pay I was getting was fairly low (£2.80 an hour approx.). The hours were long but the people who worked there were a laugh and it was overall not too bad as a Saturday job."
good,"good place to work, the cons is working oversees didn't give any career opportunities, which was really bad for a seventeen years service with Delta Airlines"
good,Paid by one of Delta subsidiaries companies which does not pay the contractors well. $1.80 per hour is too low as a salary. Delta does not say anything about that.
good,Delta was a good place to work but the hours kept getting cut back and they would change because of flights. I enjoyed the people I worked with very much.
good,"Days vary from long to short. You get about 16 working days on your schedule but you can pick up more. Get ready to never be home. If you have a significant other, children, or pets this job is even harder. You get to travel for free which is nice but on your off days you don't want to be anywhere but home. Flexibility is necessary in this career."
good,"Delta  is a contract work assignment.  "
good,"They only  have Part time with limited amount of hours and if you exceed those hours, you will be suspended or terminated. Full time takes 2 plus yrs."
good,Apendi muchas cosas nuevas muy tranquilo y muchas horas
good,They keep you busy. Use newer software so you are unknowingly updating your skills which is good when job hunting. People are not so friendly. But a decent place to work.
good,"Please see resume!"
good,"Delta is the only major airline without a union for their flight attendants, which makes the job very unsecure. You only get 2 sick days a rolling year and on your 3rd call out you're written up. The work rules are also all over the place. There are 22k+ flight attendants so they pretty much treat you like a number. "
good,Permanent night shift can be trying to a working female and her overall health. Thus to be working straight four nights can be quite a burden to one self.
good,"Really enjoyed working with the people versus the company itself. Great to use for traveling, but not great if you are using this job as a full time career."
good,i worked here 17 years ago so i have no idea how they are now.  back then they were great.  got to fly and had good benefits.  low pay though.  i would have stayed.
good,"A lot of physical work. "
good,"As they say, ""flying is flying."" Delta is a good company to work for. The destinations are great and travel benefits can't be beat. Teamwork within departments is positive."
good,"A typical work begins with setting up the gate on the ground for the arrival of the flight,guiding the plane into the gate,unloading of luggage n cargo and prepping the plane for the departure flight.The hardest part of the job is working with lazy co-workers but it is enjoyable because u r doing a great customer service for the passengers."
good,Difficult management during  the merger. The fleet was forced to move after we had been assured out facility would not be affected by the merger. Good employees left behind in this process.
good,Great training program and great benefits.  Very fast paced work environment taking flight reservations.  Fairly nice work conditions.  Good support from management.  Had to work the worst shifts because of being the newest employees.
good,"Muy linda área laboral trabajaba de cajera y encargada general "
good,"typical work on a day"
good,"Difficult job working with difficult people. The environment was loud, cold and unforgiving. Making mistakes meant causing delays. Lack of management and motivated employees often led to an unbalanced distribution of work. Getting unlimited free flights made this job tolerable."
good,"Ability to meet new people daily. Fast pace and exciting, yearly uniform allowance, educational updates via electronic media provided to enhance work performance regularly, several different shifts to accommodate various schedules and work assignments, indoor as well as outdoor positions requiring different skill sets for employees, ability to transfer within the company open and available at least twice per year."
good,"There's an opportunity to meet many wonderful people traveling from place to place, as well as the opportunity to travel yourself. Compensation is okay, but health benefits are good. The ability to switch shifts to accommodate your schedule is available after a few months through a bidding process, if necessary. Delta allows employees to swap days and hours for time off or extra hours, which is great."
good,"Very good airline operation.  Decisions are focused on investors and stock price, so company remains profitable.  Frontline employees are focused on the passenger and are well trained.  Great pilots."
good,"It is a good Place to work. They have a highly knowledgeable staff and have a friendly and collaborative environment."
good,"I learned a lot from senior developers. Atmosphere is really awesome.Entrepreneur like atmosphere makes your work that much more important to the success of the business. With the growth of Industrial Automation, opens doors to new opportunities and expansion in the company."
good,"Yes Delta is definitely a fun place to work. Very team interactive."
good,This is a good job to work at overall you just don't get a full time spot in DTW for years at a time. No one retires at this position. There are also no benifits
good,"I liked working for Delta. I loved the old lady I sat with everyday. I became pregnant and I wasn't able to lift her anymore. I had to quit ,and I started my job at Wellborn."
good,A typical day at work is chaos and confustion combined with managers who are incompetent and of no help at all.  The hardest part of the job is working with managers who don't know what they're doing.  The most enjoyable part is days off and free flights.
good,"It is a good place for those that only have high school diplomas, anything above that you are overqualified to work at the airport as a customer service rep. It is not worth all the abuse and the lack of support from upper management. Pay is not feasible for someone living in New York, the only thing that keeps you working is the free flying benefits."
good,"Must be willing to commit to 10+ years off working weekends and nights, but is a fun job with great travel benefits."
good,nunca tuve ninguna amonestacion por parte de los vecinos buen ambiente de trabajo el trato bueno con los compañeros tratando de sobrellevar los dias de trabajo lo dificil las malas noches  por lo demas bien
good,"The teams and projects you support are the most rewarding experience while employed at Delta."
good,take care of passengers as they arrive for flights. tagged and handled baggage. make sure all flight info was correct and if there was any problems take care of it for the passengers.
good,great place to work however really have to maintain accuracy and accountability. Have supportive relationships with all employees to sustain cohesion and production throughout the warehouse
good,"working the ramp at delta airlines is tough but a great job. you learn how to work hard in a team, how to manage your time and a small team every day."
good,"On a typical day at Delta Airlines, you can expect to have a lot of downtime. The environment is fun, and everyone is very friendly to each other. The hardest part was staying focused on everything you have to watch out for. Monitoring flights that are consistently changing, and the commute from Tacoma to the airport were the hardest parts of this job."
good,I spent 20 years working for this company with great benefits and compensation. There is plenty of room for advancement and the people are pleasant. They offer good pension benefits as well.
good,"Loading an unloading is a important responsiblity "
good,"Greatest revenues and profits on record followed by management reductions and layoffs.  The culture, also known as ""Rules of the Road"", only apply to front line agents, pilots and flight attendants.  As a result, work/life balance is non-existent (unless you call working 70 hours/week followed by layoff ""balanced"") especially considering all the layoffs are taxing current staff to the point of exhaustion.  It used to be a great company with a culture you could believe in and rely on; however this sadly is being wiped away."
good,Have been employed with Delta for 20.7 years and have had a great career. Layoffs affected me 11/3/2015. My career has been great and wishing the company much more success!
good,"my had day was when flight get delay"
good,"I love shoes so this job was great for me. I enjoyed the 30 percent discount on sneakers, and I also enjoyed putting together appeal to meet a counter needs."
good,Delta was once a great company to work for. The envy of the industry. Still good but very few full time positions. Most new hires are ready reserve part time.
good,Not very flexible.  Pay is decent.  Atlanta is not a great city and you pretty much have to work there if you want to move up. Working from home is a dirty word even though many people in the office do not work.
good,Flying is free. Job security is a major issue. With a simple customer complaint you are at risk of losing your job. Health insurance is mediocre.
good,This job is great for those who like to travel and explore. If you are a homebody or don't like to be away from home for long periods of time I would not recommend this job. If you have kids it is also tough since you will be away many days and nights at a time.
good,Typical day at Delta is fast paced . Very Team Oriented must use verbal skills when working together. I stay in my lane when it comes to communicating with my co-workers I do not get into personal conversation with many of my co-workers. Its a part-time job so I only work for 15-20 hours a week. The hardest part of the job is the computer documentations before and after the plane leaves lots of coded messages you must use. The best part is the free flights you can your immediate family can go on.
good,A typical day at work is very busy. Hartfield-Jackson Airport is the busiest airport in the world. While working in groups we accomplish so much. Management could be bias at times. My co-workers were very helpful and responsive. The hardest part of the job was when customers would be very disrespecful and all you can do is listen until they calm down. The most enjoyable is working with customers that have a sweet spirit and a good sense of humor.
good,"Employees work long hours and weekends"
good,If you have a tattoo either remove it or make sure it's not on a visible part of your body. I went pretty far in the process and when told that I had a tattoo received a rejection email a few days later.
good,"Very fast paced, but time moves quickly. Helpful coworkers who aren't afraid to assist you when you most need it."
good,Overall a good place to work with oppertunities for advancement.
good,"Full of energy at work."
good,Yes this a good place to work i can say and a the people around here are very nice and supportive and helpful in all the aspects
good,Delta was exciting and challenging as well.  I have always been fascinated with airplanes and it was a fun place to work.  The hardest part of the job was having to work in the elements year round.  One of the most enjoyable parts of the job was getting to meet to different celebrities and VIPS.
good,"Delta is a great place to work if you enjoy customer facing environments. There is never a dull moment and you get the opportunity to meet and help people. The down side is when trying to advance with the company,some of leadership positions are coveted and you have to compete with so many other people around the nation for the same position . Advancement is sometimes based on who you know and if they will put in a good word for you."
good,"Ils sont organisés"
good,gostei muito bom  adorei muito mesmo fiz muitas amizades adorei tive muitas experiências
good,This  place is really busy! I learned great customers skills. I had ok  management. My co- workers were ok. being lay-off was the worst thing that ever happen to me. The flight was awesome!
good,"great airline to work for, i enjoyed my years there and would go back to work there."
good,"a typical day at delta consist of numerous flights not every flight is totally a like.THE joy of working on these flights and meeting different people from different states was one of my high points.being able to travel on these flights for a yearly fee was another enjoyment.Being a supervisor at one point taught me alot of responsability and dedication with this job.The most difficult part of this job is having late  flights come in on top of the regular scheduled flights but with the right crews and determination the job is a piece of cake on time departures and all.The most enjoyable part of the job is being rewarded with dinners tickets to baseball games etc,but for me is the satisfacton of getting these aircrafts off safely and our passengers enjoying there flight to there destination where ever that may be."
good,"Good co-workers. "
good,"Busy but fun on a typical day."
good,"Dealing with Passengers on a personal level.  Solving any issues that may arise such as missed flights, delayed flight and altered travel."
good,A new experience in the travel industry in helping customers make travel arrangements and also being able to assist with travel arrangements and offering upgrades and other perks and benefits when available 
good,"Not enough opportunities, but the flying benefits was awesome"
good,"Job duties include: cleaning planes (inside and out), restocking materials, misc duties as needed"
good,"Productive workplace, but did not enjoy working the very late evening shifts."
good,"I would reccommend Delta as an employer. The travelling benefits, growth opprtunities and constant implenting of new tracking systems."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of being briefed by the supervisor about any news, events or possible challenges for the day. In addition, employees would signal planes that arrive to the gate and unload all baggage from the plane. Later employees would fuel the planes, load baggage and freight when it was time for take off."
good,"I really enjoy the cultural exchange opportunity that I had in Delta Airlines, I loved interact with different cultures and help passengers while they were in Ecuadorean territory, it truly made me feel like an ambassador of my country."
good,"Have to deal with angry customers daily. Some nice people though, that you work with. Management isn't very good. They are promoted based on who they know and how well they get along with that person."
good,Very fast paced and always challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job was the challenge of solving problems and interacting with all the customers.
good,Company was bought out by Delta thereby making further input moot.
good,"great emplyers, 28 year career, constant change, great learning experience to behad by all"
good,"A typical day is normally hectic, but there can be rewarding moments."
good,I was contract employee and didn't receive any benefits. It launched my freight career.
good,A typical day was returning emails and voice mails. After that identifying what tasks needed to be completed that day. I learned more about airline seating than someone should know. I had several different managers some were very educational and personable others seemed to struggle. The direct team was small so we bounced things off each other or used each other as a resource. The hardest part of my job would be learning the industry and the most enjoyable was learning a new industry.
good,"The hardest part of my job is trying to satisfy the most difficult passenger, but when you get them what they want and a smile comes over their face, it makes my whole day. I learned that no 2 passengers are the same. Everyone is different from all walks of life with all kinds of backgrounds and that's what I enjoy about my job."
good,"odd hours, with no hope for changing shift. Company culture was magnificent."
good,"The hardest part of this job was trying to remember where, 1st class goes and where coach bags go then where does all the codes go in thee terminals."
good,"Loading and unloading bags, mail, human remains."
good,"Great company, free flights when ever you want. It was a blast until 9-11 happened"
good,"I worked in reservations and there was a lot of moving around. Managers and supervisors changed regularly. There were good ones and bad ones. Employees moved around a lot also. The company is not sympathetic to personal needs. Everything (shifts, days off,...) is allotted by seniority and non-negotiable. Everything is micro managed, including break/lunch time, how long you spend on the phone with customers, etc. The overall employee morale was really low."
good,"Working at Delta as an engineer is not a very rewarding experience. The company seems to value front line employees a lot more. The company is going through an acquisition. The environment is changing radically. The work is awesome. You're working on airplanes, big metal things that fly through the air, what more do you want."
good,The Delta Air Lines work environment  and culture is professional and rewarding because of the meaningful work and focus on customers. Contractors are paid generously because they do not benefit from internal perks like flight benefits. Contractors often carry the load and fill in the gaps for full time employees who at times are focused on maintaining and building relationships instead of focusing on the work.
good,Good place to work. The company takes care of the employees well. Very focused on innovation. The benefits are good as well from flights to health care.
good,"Fun place to work if you do not mind physical work. Need seniority to"
good,"Pay is good for a starting job"
good,"You'll never hear the word layoffs, but you will hear transformation and reorganization is very common. Some new leader changes and it's almost a bully-like environment"
good,"It's a great job as far as flight benefits and pay. Management is not very personable and seems to thrive on negative feedback, seems like they love to write you up for something."
good,It was one of my first jobs were i learned structure in a work place by my daily duties and assignments. Worked with different types of people which it helped me right now as i speak.
good,"I cannot speak for Delta as I worked at Northwest Airlines before being purchased by Delta; my comments are related to NWA.  At the time I was employed we received vacation, sick days and travel benefits, none of the aforementioned benefits.  Working conditions were physically not the best.  We climbed 47 steps to reach the top of a windowless hanger where we were often exposed to jet fumes.  In general management left much to be desired.  I met and worked with lots of great people."
good,"Everyday I had to deal with different things, I learnt how to recognize a fake passport, how to deal with the guests travelling from Venice, and how to focus despite the pressure."
good,I worked in the call center and it took a toll on me mentally. They expect you to take 70+ calls a day which is doable but you're brain dead by the end of the day.
good,This company has given me great opportunity in field of my expertise as a fresh grad. And introduced me in corporate world with desired professionalism and career growth. It was fun working here.
good,"Working on the service desk with Delta was a time sensitive position.  Agents are required to assist pilots, flight attendants, gate agents and others to enable them to stay on schedule with incoming and outgoing flights.  The job itself consisted of long 12 hour days with a 30 minute break and two 15 minute breaks.  The culture has a hands on management style which is required to keep peek performance."
good,There is a quite a bit of change underway at the time. This is a good thing in that there's never time to be idle. The downside is that there's little time afforded to learn one particular area to perfect your craft.
good,"The overall job culture is fairly good. My typical day at  work is physical and consist of me being out in all types of elements. I've learned the importance of work place safety as a result of dealing with potentially hazardous  equipment. The hardest part of my job is being able to cope with multiple flight delays. I enjoy my flights benefits, which enable me to travel the world."
good,You have a  different job every day. . ..Management are ok  you are never rush  workplace culture is relax. I like the co-workers. The hardest part is finding new parts.
good,"The work can be busy or light depending upon the work area. The hardest part of the job is getting time off, the best parts include flight benefits and profit sharing."
good,"Many years ago this was a GREAT place to work. Family atmosphere. People cared for one another. It slowly, changed like many big business."
good,"Delta as a company has been performing well, and your job security is good as long as you follow the rules (though they're constantly adding/modifying rules). The best part about working for Delta is the flight benefits, and the flexible schedule. If you don't want to work a particular day you can give it away to someone willing to pick it up, and vice versa. My biggest problem is the lack, or nonexistence, of internal promotion. Once you're in a department, you're pretty much locked in with little chance of moving up in the company."
good,If you was a direct hire then the company was great. For subcontractors though it was a roll of the dice for your experience.
good,"Trabalhei por pouco tempo na empresa, mas não pude prosseguir devido a incompatibilidade de horários."
good,"As an OPS agent I deal with various issues consistent to the airline industry. "
good,Overall my experience at Delta was one that was very useful to me in helping learn how to manage a business that is cash dominant. The environment was a very friendly one to be in but as a Junior in college preparing for graduation this job has run its course.
good,"Fue mi primer trabajo como cajero y repositor , aprendí ambas cosas, el ambiente laboral era excelente, me sirvio como experiencia ..."
good,"Great Coworkers, good live work balance,approachable management and awesome flight benefits! People really care about you. It can be seen as top heavy."
good,"Lost my job because it went out of business. Worked in rain, snow, hot weather for $8.00 per hour. Because of flight schedules, we had a lot of breaks."
good,"Ramp Agent, Loading Unloading Aircraft, Getting planes ready for take off and landing, In contact with Onboard flight crew"
good,"A day would start at what gate you are assigned. I learned that it counts on how you load a aircraft. To make sure it is balanced. Like most jobs there were very rude co-workers. The reward of my job was plenty the pay, meeting people from other countries, and being able to fly for free."
good,Good Job with new challenges every day.Co-workers are usely pretty easy to get along with and management are easy to talk to.The hardest part is dealing with other crafts during crunch time.The most enjoyable part is at the finish when every thing comes together.
good,"I worked for Pinnacle almost 15 years.  The first 13 years were wonderful.  You work hard at times, but between great coworkers, majority of supervisors good, great pay and flight benefits made up for it."
good,"1 mth paid training that you must pass in order to be hired permanently. Answer customer calls & look up flight schedules as well as book flights. 60 plus calls per 8 hr shift. Very easy environment to work in, flexible with scheduling. Co workers are team players & professional. Always fly free in USA! Great benefits package as well. Organized company with great management team!"
good,"Meet, greet and direct passenger as they arrived to the airport assisted passenger with getting their tickets out of kiosk machine. Provide assistant to passengers that have missed their flights to get them to their final destination."
good,"A typical day at work includes telephone communications in an inbound call center:"
good,"A typical workday involved checking in an hour before flight, doing pre-flight emergency checks and crew briefings, serving customers from all walks of life, managing all types of inflight situations including medical emergencies and safety issues.  The toughest part of the job is when severe turbulence occurs during flight.  The most enjoyable part of the job is touring exotic destinations around the world."
good,Nice pretty simple job learned a lot. Loaded and unloaded planes learned a lot about aviation. Had a chance to use all type of equipment and vehicles.
good,"I was able to gain vast cargo industry knowledge during my time at Delta. In my location, leadership suffered from high turnover, with the most recent leader having minimal cargo experience. Despite the leadership challenges, most of the team was there to work hard and demonstrated pride in a job well done. The most enjoyable aspect was in training new employees, ensuring a safe and profitable operation, while being able to highlight areas of difficulty improving local processes."
good,"I learned to sell, sell, sell. I learned how to handle disgruntled passengers, offer options, and turn that frown upside down!"
good,"Customer Service Manager for the Airlines. Managed over 40 agents at a time all across the United States. The hardest part of my job is being able to adapt to climate and inclement weather (flight delays). The most enjoyable part is dealing with people (Agents preventing attrition)(Customers)"" being able to help and restore good customer service hospitality back in our society"""
good,Great co-workers hardest part of the job is dealing with weather elements.
good,It was a marriage made in Heaven for the first 5 years then financial difficulty and corner cutting took this once proud Company down.
good,Collaborative colleagues with strong passion for airline industry
good,"The employees that work for the company are great, very strenuous work but didn't mind the hustle and bustle, great benefits"
good,"Delta Air lines Hub in JFK airport, demands a lot of focus and attention to detail and safety of passengers and gate crew members."
good,It would be a great place to work knowing you could retire one day but with only a 401k option it will be very difficult. I am currently working multiple positions and and being paid for one.
good,physical labor . Most shifts are at night or overnight.  must have the ability to work nights and weekends.. All new employees start out as part time with low pay/
good,Not a a very good enviroments people dont care about the job they dont listen co corwerkers donr like to help you in anyway. They disapear you cant find them they dont follow company policy
good,"Working at Delta provided me a great opportunity to travel and see the world however working in the call center can be very stressful especially when productivity is heavily weighed when taking calls and attempting to provide quality service.  Delta is an amazing airline, just be prepared to work and often times different departments are political and some managers are not degreed.  very hard holding two degrees sitting next to someone who had climbed the ranks as a result of time and experience."
good,"A typical day started with the daily deep dive, daily report execution, giving and receiving feedback from employees and colleagues, and daily wrap up meetings (did we accomplish our goals). I always had great leadership and support. The organization provided opportunities to grow and prosper, and the culture was positive. The hardest part of the job was travel and being away from my family at times."
good,"i loved working at the gates and the arrivals , i use to work in baggage service , check in area , kiosk i was helping the customers to get there boarding passes"
good,"Delta is a wonderful company to work for, I have received many awards and allocations. I have learned much during my time with Delta. Delta offers great seminars and travel for their employees."
good,"Great company yet the culture needs to change. They value shareholders over their employees. Also, they are mainly bringing on contractors from offshores rather than hiring employees or contractors in the US. Which is not only hurting the company and making the lives of current employees harder since they have to pick up the slack from offshore contractors, but none of this matters to the higher ups since it saves the company money and keeps shareholders ""happy""."
good,"It is a solid career  but it takes to long to top out . Like 8-10 years and that's all you can strive for it seems, it's very hard to move around to different job classification and if you stay long enough to top out you will never advance, because then you will have at least 10 years seniority and will always make same money . Without advancement."
good,"It's a tough company to move up in.  I spent 3 years trying to get full time while having a degree in Aviation Management.  They stress safety first and safety sensitive position, but yet you may or may no be making cost of living depending on where you're at within the company.  The co-workers are probably the best part, but management rules were all over the place.  One manager would say you can do this and the other would say you couldn't."
good,"Working for any airline is going to be very stressing because we are under paid and expected to do so much. There are fun time like on time departure and arrival, but winter time is the worst."
good,"Typical workdays at the Cargo position include lifting, packing items and sorting mail. Some days also can include the transport and loading of cargo containers. The Cargo is a friendly workplace, but can get tense during peak hours due to volume. The staff and management here was somewhat complacent and did not seek to much change in the workplace as it has been over 30+ years for most staff at this location."
good,Due to changes in the airline industry the job became very stressful. Additional work and often working short of help often made things difficult. The last 10 years I worked there there were almost no increase in salary and decrease in benifits  even with all the additional work load and responsibility’s
good,Immediate supervisor did a great job of working with you on your schedule and ensuring getting time off that you needed. Mostly eight hour shifts and work can be fun and is not strenuous.
good,the metrics will matter over everything. a company that is deeply focused on gaining year over year. cost will become a large factor behind company decisions including hiring internal over external.
good,"My experience and opinion about this job - it was a hybrid field, danger, racially segregated job with a poor supervisor/management and under intense monitorization. I felt like in a prison. "
good,"This is a great place to get in to the aviation industry.  I have built a tremendous amount of experience working here.  The work is hard, yet rewarding if you have a passion for the aviation industry.  The pay is meager, and that is a generous description.  Management has always been very supportive of those that are reliable and do their work.  Delta has a great culture, DGS - not so much.  Turnover is high, partially due to pay, partially due to the demands of working outside all year in varied weather conditions.  The pace is fast and some cannot handle it.  I would not hesitate to tell people to get in, learn what you can, work hard, and get out."
good,"A typical day begins with a briefing of any turnovers, continuing projects, or any issues that may need correcting into our shift. The equipment that we service are conveyor belts and passenger boarding bridges, ground power units, and precondition air units. This is an excellent starting point for someone who has a basic grasp of mechanical abilities and are looking to expand on those here. In addition to mechanics, electrical / electronics, HVAC, PLCs all are something that are to be learned and there is a library of information for everyone to access to fulfill their hearts desire. The workplace culture is not without it's ups and downs, however, for the most part is a relatively neutral area. It can be difficult dealing with complacency among a few individuals which in a department of just under 100 people can translate into factional groups that may deviate from the norm. Management seems to always be in flux and there is a fair amount of push back between the lower tiered employees and the leaders / managers. Very reactive as opposed to proactive with the way business is conducted at time, and vice versa. Continually a learning process. Hardest part of the job is having to deal with the bureaucracy, certain policies, and unnecessary attitudes that can make certain days rather trying. Another challenge is the work/life balance that exists due to the fact that there is usually more travel time from home to work and work home due to the additional security checks that exist (and all off the clock as well). This job for people who are looking to go to back to school may not"
good,The company was sold to Delta Airlines. Not sure how the operations are today but prior to that it was a pretty good place to work. A lot of traveling. Stations visited were excellent.
good,"Good place to work for travel, if you love to travel this is the job for you. Training is high stress and hard., but do able. Have fun working for Delta."
good,Good place to build a career.  Diverse workforce. Challenging jobs with advancement potential.  Offers ability to work in various fields in different locations.
good,"I was a part-timer. Therefore, I know nothing of the medical benefit. However, the flying benefits where great. The staff was awesome, never a dull moment at work. They don't work around your schedule as they promise."
good,This job can be very difficult at times because essentially you are loading tons of mail into containment units for delivery to planes. You are under mercy of the weather and it is a relief position so promptness is extremely important.
good,"I worked for Delta Air Lines, Inc for 4 and a half years as a ramp agent. Overall, it's a decent company to work for, for what it's worth. The flight benefits are the real reason a lot of people stay with the company. That and the fact that you can move up in the company.  My advice is to come to work to WORK and not make FRIENDS. Do your job, collect your money, travel the world, and mind your business."
good,"I assembled facets and set projection molds I ran forklifts, company was clean and u could advance quick.  Work was fast pace but fun."
good,"I have worked here for over one year and have developed so much as a human overall. However, DGS has it's pros and cons. Ultimately, a nice company to work for."
good,"The Delta culture is infectious and one that is unmatched. The job itself is not unlike any other flight attendant position.  The management can sometimes vary as to how they treat the employees.  Overall, not a bad company to work for."
good,"good flight benefits, traveled a lot when i work for them,  My Husband is now a Supervisor for Delta. ticket, ramp and gate traning,  always have some computer training to do with safely and OSHA"
good,"relaxed environment when a flight wast on the ground , learned a lot far as airplanes go , very good place to start if you want a career in aviation"
good,"Flexible schedule and you fly for free, but your body does pay for it. The job does allow you and your immediate family to travel the world."
good,"It was a great job with great benefits health benefits are included. It was poorly managed though. With large market jobs there isn't time to be sure every single details is precise i get it, just needed more people its such a big company."
good,"Decent place to work, lots of opportunites to use education for advancement. One of biggest pluses of working for Delta you can transfer to other cities"
good,"Fast paced working environment"
good,Nice company to work with!  It was challenging for the first couple of months getting the airline up and running. quickly became a tight family!
good,"•	Attended preflight briefings concerning weather, altitudes, routes, emergency procedures, crew coordination, lengths of flights, food and beverage services offered, and numbers of passengers."
good,trabalhavamos na ag encia bancaria n ti nhamos contato c os funci narios da empresa so por telefone.
good,Arrive 8am
good,"A typical day at work was dispatching flights out on time and because of this I learned how to prioritize, work under pressure with tight deadlines, efficiently, quick, safe and organized. The management at the station could do better to boost employee morale. The job is not hard and the most enjoyable part is the co-workers and people watching."
good,The experience I gained from Delta Airlines was truly invaluable. I worked for them for about 12yrs and they taught me true professionalism.
good,"At the airport I was working it was a lot of employees, so the environment was very diverse and welcoming. I learned to have patience and manage my time. The hardest part of the job is not taking passengers angry attitude personal. Some days are easier than others but you learn. Management needs a lot of help at LAX from when I left in 2017, however that doesn't show Delta as a whole."
good,I was a Facilities maintenance mechanic for Northwest Airlines.  My days usually consisted of working on building equipment and assigning work to the personnel that work for me.
good,"High call volume, noisy environment, management is actually nice and works with you. Food is always provided and they take the time for employees to get to know each other by having events such as potlucks and movie nights. You work hard but you play hard also"
good,"You have amazing perks. Our managers are excellent. We are all a big family and we all take care of each other.Delta is a great company, You also learn so much"
good,"I love the company and the people I worked with but with management changing, I have chosen to look for somehwere that gives me more flexability. You have to be willing to take a lot of verbal abuse and be very aware of rules and regulations at all times. When it comes to compliance Delta takes it very seriously because it costs them millions."
good,"Avalio  a empresa delta como uma ótima empresa"
good,"Delta airlines is the mother. i worked for DGS which is a subsidiary for delta airlines. working for dgs can be an amazing job. most of the people i work with are young, living with parents. I currently work full time trying to make a living and i can tell this is no place to be when your trying to make money. theres no money here, however i work with people that do amazing things. there is this one guy (we will just call him john smith), he just spent 2 weeks camping on the beach in nicaragua in his hammock just in absolute serenity and paradise. there are so many more stories however this is the kind of career  i cannot explain. not enough space. if you dont have financial responsibilities, this is your place. not good for making money though."
good,"Typical day at work was answering 10 to 20 phone calls a day providing the red carpet experience to Delta's elite travel agencies. The work place culture was amazing because it was one big melting pot and filled with lots of diversity. The hardest part was dealing with poor management. I learned a lot of great work ethics, that I will be able to take with me for years to come."
good,Delta Airlines gave me an opportunity to work with different Management cultures and to Train all staff about Customer service and Airline Marketing. Although I had only a short period to work for them
good,"The job is very simple and repetitive, but the dangers of working around many different types of machinery and vehicles, lies a imminent threat to injury. Great place to work, but be cautious."
good,Exhausting long hours on the phone. Co-workers are very nice. Management is very nice. Hardest part of the job is the different shift bids. What I most liked was the flight benefits.
good,"Recibir pacientes, asistir en consulta, atender llamadas, acomodar expedientes."
good,"Very good working conditions and really good job, everything is fine, but there's a little job, no full-time job. Good management, good conditions for working, warm and dry."
good,"Striving to get the job completed."
good,"Working as a ramp agent is demanding. Unload and load planes can be, and very likely will be, very taxing on your body. The good thing is you do this for 45-60 minutes and then you get breaks of an equal duration. Not always though, because some days you might get back to back flights and not many breaks. But usually, you'll be able to recover in between flights."
good,"Busy engaging with the traveling public."
good,1. Make sure all work stations and kiosk are cleaned and stocked for the work day.
good,"I learned how to pick/pack, load and unload trucks with products"
good,"Company is known for its' safety record in the industry of air travel. Reservation specialist daily would assist in booking flights, making flight changes or confirming flights, along with providing partner vendor information for customers. I utilized my prior management experience to support management upon request to mentor and train other teammates and associate. The most enjoyable part of the job was planning a successful tool and path for a co-worker and see it happen for them. The least or hardest part of the job was to provide management with negative feedback and not have the authority to work a plan of success AND see the follow up necessary that yield success for the employee."
good,great company could use some fine tuning with their management. great people and comrade. they do a great job of benefits but not the overall satisfaction of the employee
good,Incompetent management at various levels - Flight benefits were great (when you could get on)... Working in inclement weather can be challenging. Physically challenging some days.  Not staffed appropriately.
good,Guide the trucks out safely from parking lot to the airport. Guide it safely towards and away from each airplane. Hardest part was cleaning a biiiig plane in just under 5 minutes or so. The people made the job worth it. I learned the behind the scenes of keeping an aircraft clean.
good,"I flew for 20 years with Northwest Airlines and the last 5 years of my career, Delta purchased Northwest.  It was a somewhat difficult merger transition.  The two companies had a totally different culture and needless to say, I much preferred that of Northwest."
good,"I learned how to deice planes, you can learn a lot about FAA regulations.  The flying benefits were excellent. I also drove equipment on the tarmac,  delivered luggage to designated gate areas."
good,Management doesn't go according to policy. Lets just say you can get away with  A LOT as long as your lead likes you or your metric are in great shape when review time comes.
good,"This job required that you be capable of prolonged physical activity, fast at problem solving and having the ability to meet deadlines and efficiently work with others in the department."
good,I need a job because i dont have a job right now my last job i started 2013 and stopped at 2015 and i really want to work here in this job because i dont have a job right now and this job is closer to my house and i can make more money here.
good,"Working for delta is a great job they offer excellent benefits and the company is fair with their employees. Over the years working on the ramp i learned a lot like hazard materials, company and airport safety guidelines, helping passengers with gate claims.I think the hardest part of the job is when flights arrive late and you have to hustle to get the flight fast as u can so the passengers will connect to their final destination. Best part of the day is when its time to go home and relax with friends and family go fishing."
good,"When i worked at NWA, it was during a time when management and the unions were at odds. This made some things difficult and stressful because the engineers are considered management. All people that i worked with in the engineering department were easy to get along with and were great mentors to me."
good,"great place to work "
good,Great work/Life Balance. Not a lot of career progression in a call center setting. Benefits are amazing but getting a pay raise based on your individual performance is difficult.
good,"The job was a fun"""" Seen different ppl that travel all over the world see famous people u see on tv Great."
good,"Delta airlines is a globally diverse company. It is a fun and exciting place to work, with various job opportunities. One can easily grow and develop new skills there/"
good,Delta as a company is great to work for. I love the person I became in the 5 years I worked there. Unfortunately as female Aircraft Technician your chances of moving up the ladder narrow greatly specially in Atlanta where people get promoted by who their parents are who they know not based on skill and qualifications. If a guy have 2 years in the company he will promote but if you are a girl you need 7. Ve least 7
good,"a little on the unorganized side. One supervisor says this, one says that... also, I didn't enjoy the 4a.m. shift at all! Co-workers were great though and benefits were awesome!"
good,"I checked passengers in for their flight. I made sure flight departed on time.Checked baggage. Extensive knowledge of ticketing and reading fare ladders. Consistantly adhered to company policies & proceedures."
good,Cool place to work with an excellent opportunity to grow. awesome workplace and excellent chance to explore the world and work for a company that is stationary.
good,Loading and unloading aircraft.
good,"You get to see a plethora of different people everyday. The hours are reasonable, the people you work with are constantly friendly and always willing to help."
good,Company very fair regarding pay practices and employee work life balance.
good,Foi bom pois aprendir bastante e ganhei bastante experiência
good,the dealta ramp was a 8 gate lane and no order among the agents no control over anything just show up and work and don't get hurt
good,"loading and unloading flight, clean aircrafts, park overnight aircraft in remote area.if weather was bad we would have be mando for overtime. it was a great company to work for."
good,"I learned a lot, my location had great trainers and mentors, their reasoning for letting me go had many holes as other people who were let go had far more no call no shows than the one I had, others had like 5+. Management was never present always doing a regional managers job elsewhere only showed up for a few days a month. Workplace was safe employees/coworkers made the job worth going to.  Most enjoyable part of the job was watching the planes leave the terminal heading to their destination which lead to down time for our many choirs"
good,Love the expirence of meeting new people every day. The co-workes were nice. Got to meet very important people
good,I was laid off after 911 from northwest airlines - now delta and the union didn't do anything to help us with our jobs unless you have 20 years in...I only had 3 and a half years....loved my benefits to fly.
good,"I worked for Delta Airlines part time along with my main job as a Manager for Xcel Energy. The company was having management problems there was no formal training.the pay was poor and the employees were unhappy. I liked the job as i was able to fly for free,"
good,free flights dsfygdshhggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggfds
good,empresa se encontra em desenvolvimento..aguardamos melhorias
good,"Working here was a fun experience...Seeing Planes take off,going on  bringing  a child on board and seat them making sure they were safe by giving the air hostess the child's credentials, looking at the their excited faces knowing they were in safe hands  going back home to their destinations."
good,A typical day at delta was very fast paced and dangerous if not paying attention. Management was only 50% attentive to the outside hands-on work. I have learned to pay close attention to my work environment and to communicate well with my assigned team. The culture of being in a team made the job an enjoyable experience for day to day assignments. The best part would have to be the acknowledgement of your good work from the customers whether verbal or non- verbal meaning the smile on their faces.
good,"I love the benefits, i enjoyed working for delta the employees are awesome. management need to be a little more considerate to employee personal life."
good,If I could advance to corporate I wouldn't have left. It was a fun place to work but I think their front line gets overlooked.
good,Delta has been a great opportunity for me. They've given me a ride of a lifetime with travel all over the world. It's been an amazing experience to be part of such a great company.
good,"Uma empresa boa de trabalhar,tinha um horário bom. Fiz alguns colegas de trabalho.Foi uma experiência boa."
good,"I love the company that Delta has built overall, although I have seen how most of the company is managed. I have begun to feel that there is a small amount of motion allowed in the lower end of the corporation. I would love to move beyond my current position but have not been allowed the time to do so."
good,"a typical day at work was just go to work,see today where am i working,what is load for the day.learned what not to do"
good,"Responsible for tracking baggage through the Delta system, proactively notifying station of baggage mishandling, as well as reviewing and coding loss, damage, pilferage and/or delay. Possessed strong decision-making ability and a self-starter highly motivated, dependable, and open to change. Initiated and implemented the services as per customers need. Good judgment and excellent problem-solving skills. Provided technical help desk assistance for Delta systems and website problems."
good,"•	Embraced the Delta Culture to ensure that the happiness of the passenger is achieved"
good,Manager wasn't as professional as they should have been. Other employees were favorited by other managers and supervisors. Rude remarks made by everyone I worked by. Lady's at the front desk ate from the kitchen when they knew they weren't allowed to during lunch.
good,"I loved coming into work each day and working with a great group of people and piers who were always willing to work together, share, and cross train.  The hardest part of the job was work/life balance."
good,"Good part time place to work"
good,"I loved the experience working with air crafts, the many types of people. Management, hours, pay and no advancement was a deal breaker. I'd love to go back if the pay, hours and they actually trained you for the job. Even though I had to train myself, overall I wouldn't trade my experience there for the world. Yes there were some bad apples but also were a lot of good people that I got to work with and meet and help that were travelers."
good,"Everyday was a busy day, although holiday's and Sunday's were the most busy. You experience a wide variety of people from coworkers to passengers from all different backgrounds of life. Culturally, it was a good experience to not constantly be surrounded by people that think exactly like you. I learned and traveled a lot. All of which I believe made me as open minded as I am today."
good,"You can make good money here,but they will take anything and everything away from you including benefits and pay,in order to pay their ""elite"" management ...Flight benefits have become a joke,as one flies on standby and today you have a better chance of winning the lottery.Delta is also bigot they only approve of young pretty women,and make teh rest suffer."
good,"poco tiempo , tan solo cubriendo una baja laboral ."
good,Airlines industry has changed a lot over the years has become more responsibility and more pressure for lesser wages and lesser benefits don't recommend this job if you plan on putting 60 hours a week just to get ahead in life to keep up with your bills.
good,I enjoyed working there and lots of team work. I looking for fulltime positon with benefits and other advancement.
good,O trabalho me ajudou no apreendizado na area de Licitação.
good,"I worked for Delta Airlines for 3 years, Delta gives you the opportunity to travel all over the world... and the chance to meet people from all over the world"
good,"As a ""Contractor"" for delta it's almost not worth it. You do have flight benefits and a slight delta discount, but if you have a family, and or are the sole income of your house, then it may not work out. You are a contractor, so there is no pto or sick leave. You don't get holidays off, and there is no convalescence or anything like that for you. Delta also uses a Tenure system to bid for shift work. Last in last choice, and therefore you will be ""stuck"" on a shift that isn't conducive to normal family life or social activities. Delta has profit sharing, and that also will not apply. The salary for the job however is above average for the meager requirements for this position. It is a good contracting gig. If you can get yourself established as a contractor, and let go of the idea of finding a career here then it may be for you."
good,Very flexible when it comes to trading work days away. They have a step pay raise and so there usually never a performance evaluation. The pay is good starting at 14$ however it very hard to get full time.
good,Delta allows you to travel at a discounted rate and see the world.  Working here there are no two days that are alike.  It is very fast pace and things are always changing.
good,its cool hard to get full time where u can recieve the benifits rhard work but it pays off with the stand by flights just $5 more an hr would make a huge difference in morral
good,I enjoyed my position at Delta.  It allowed travel and flexibility. It also allowed me to have one on one contact with people of various nationalities.
good,"Depending on the city and department the job may or may not be (cool, fun and easy)."
good,Stressful Management on time performance. Required to perform multiple tasks sometimes at the same time.Short staff to perform the required objectives
good,"from the time you hit the concourse, it is ""off to the races!!""passengers have needs, gates need assistance, your radio has endless calls. Long hours when the weather is unfavorable for travel. Passengers can be very rude and condescending. Multi-task city!"
good,"was able to work remote, which was a nice incentive, no free or discounted flying privileges due to my being a contractor. Awesome supervisor with forward thinking mindset."
good,"I liked working with the people."
good,Unskilled labor that is based solely on seniortiy and not merit. Its a difficult to manuever away from the manual labor that is readily available. Not ideal.
good,"A front face customer service environment. The job afforded the opportunity to meet and work with diverse group of people. I appreciate Delta's focus on development of their brand and working to make it better in ever aspect including uniform we. "
good,"Wonderful job, but being away from home and loved ones constantly was not easy. Wonderful to travel and experience different cultures, but difficult to maintain a relationship being gone all the time."
good,"Delta is a good stable company to work for.  If you can get part time or full time status its great, however if you work at an airport that is not a main hub, the ready reserve status can potentially be a dead end position."
good,It is a good place to work however they expect a lot of patience from you. You have to be willing to wait 3-4 years before you go full time and get benefits. The work is easy and the flight benefits are cool but Im looking for something full time
good,Answered incoming calls and helped to find the right travel arrangements for our customers.  If you are looking for the best arrangements for them that know and really do appreciate it.
good,"nice place to work long hours to work good benefits"
good,If you are looking for a job that is going to keep you on your toes this is the job for you!!! Everyday it is something new! Customer say and do the craziest things. however the job is fairly easily but if you are doing ticket counter it does require some lifting up to 70 lbs and standing for 5 or 8 hours.
good,only did this job because there is nothing else available to a college student. free food was one of the major perks but pay is practically nothing for all the negativity you take
good,"Working for Delta / DGS is a consistent daily change because of the passengers and how many flights come and go. I have been able to really understand how to flexible. "
good,"-fix non a/p items"
good,empresa muito boa com exelente ambiente  de trabalho com apoio dos superiores
good,Delta is a a productive place and is the definition of how a well run business is supposed to be run . the co workers are great and the best part of the job is the fact that you are able to meet new people everyday
good,"In charge of aircraft while on the ground, coordinated efforts of Delta agents and 5 other contractors to offload, load, fuel, clean, stock, maintenance."
good,Constant turnover in management. Hot work environment. Heavy lifting.
good,Great Employer with good benefits. Fast paced enviornment.
good,Very strong corporate infrastructure with little room for advancement. I have learned a lot about SAP and other parts of the daily operation.
good,It does put a strain on your body in the long run. Most people eventually move to a higher position to get away from the physical labor. It has flight benefits which is really good.
good,"In peak season you work stead for your 8 hr shift loading and unloading planes."
good,"Decent company, pay was low in airports. Management was great and fair. Not much career advancement opportunities. I think the company has a lot good leaders that coach employees."
good,The job is very face pace and full of regulations and procedures but you are providing a service to people. You have to endure all seasons of weather but working with a good team makes things great
good,"Check peaople in for flights"
good,"Delta is  a great place to work.  Great benefits and perks.  I am used to making more money having worked in the Mortgage Industry for 10 years prior.  The management has changed a lot, under the previous president, it was more employee and people focused.  Now it is more numbers driven."
good,"Delta Global Services is a subsidiary owned by Delta Airlines. Not sure why Indeed thinks I worked at mainline Delta, but I didn't. Real Delta is a completely different beast from DGS and it shows in abundance. Completely different culture and level of competence. DGS was basically created by people that were being downsized out of mainline Delta during a downturn and it shows. DGS is all about doing everything as cheaply as possible even if it ruins the finished product. Real Delta on the other hand actually cares what that product is like and goes the extra mile. Don't confuse the two companies, they are night and day."
good,aprendi muito a conversar e lidar com as pessoas ...
good,"a tipical day at work consists of marshaling in a plan and parking it. unloading the bags, reloading new bag(luggage)  cleaning the inside of a plane. emptying out feces"
good,"Work was fulfilling being around the aircraft your working on, however the growth and advancement was slow. Management was okay.  They always had management reading management books to try and improve their leadership skills.  Culture was very diverse.  Everyone was nice and worked as a team."
good,"I was actually working for a subsidiary of Delta. I was a contract worker for Delta Air Lines Global Services. Super Fast paced, turn times for planes averaged about 21 minutes. Did usually about 10 Flights a day, sometimes 3 at a time. The culture was amazing, it was like a family to be honest. Loved the work, and the people. Pay just wasn't enough, and no room for advancement into management unless relocating states."
good,"The main tasks ond work was to install Go-Go's 2KU Wi-Fi sysem on all Delta exasiting active fleets."
good,"When I worked there management is based on pyramid system, so top doesn't know the pulse of bottom.  However the culture and benefits made up for this system."
good,I loved being at the gates and putting people on the plane because the level of stress was really low. I like doing the ticket counters but the boss was always looking over your shoulder.
good,"On the white collar side, excellent company with a positive and encouraging undertone. On the blue collar side, far less advancement and company unity."
good,Most employees are hired on as part time and then it may take a while to achieve full time status. Benefits and pay are not the best and union dues need to be taken into consideration. I prefer to work directly with a supervisor as opposed to a third party.
good,Great travel perks. Low job security. Lay off created hundreds of unemployed nation-wide.Then they hire many back. Unnecessary drama. Many still unemployed.
good,"Overall it is a good job, but they are currently going through a number of changes that make job security low. The benefits are good if you get to use them."
good,"like working there becusre I did a lot ran a wire machine did not like the management I like working with my co-worker .there no hard  part about this job I enjoy working with the people,"
good,"not suitable for any one in serious monogamous relationship......"
good,"Delta Airlines is a large company with 80,000 employees. My experience at Delta has been great because I've been able to interact with employees in other departments. Although, I did not enjoy the organization I was under, I saw fit that there were other organizations that were very different however embodied the Delta culture."
good,Pay in the airline industry is very poor but you are able to fly for free!!! I loved this benefit but things changed after 9/11. It was a sad time to be in the line of work.
good,"I've work for 4 years and thru 3 company changes during my time here. DELTA is a great airline to work for, although you may not think so after so many years. I'd hoped to get a job at the actual MAINLINE company soon. The connection side working with th smaller planes was a great experciene and a chance to meet alot of great people."
good,A typical day starts at 6:45am and continues until 3:15pm. We are expected to be alert and on time. Horse play is not allowed and over all a safe place to work.
good,A place where employees work together to acheive one goal your efferts nevr goes unnoticed a typical day is fastpace management I good co_workers is always together always work as a team harest part of the job is when there is a short staff situation the most enjoyable is when there is a 100% on time  departure .
good,"Delta has a lot of values which are good values if you ask me. The job is very physically demanding with minimal pay, but has a great benefit package compared to other airlines."
good,Good company depending on what manager you have.  Good luck getting on permanent unless you live in Atlanta.
good,"I would start my day with at least 5 phone calls with issues impacting the operations either in Washington, DC airport , Dulles,VA airport and Baltimore airport. Then get a list of out of service equipment within the three stations then prioritize. I have my morning briefings then Place orders for parts that are needed, Talked to my contractors and vendors. Check the airport operations for broken down equipment that wasn't reported from the night shift; if I'm short handed work on some of the equipment on the floor. I learned how to make quick decisions, and how to manage a group, and how to manage my time at work. The hardest part of my job was that I had too many managers to satisfy all in one day. The most enjoyable  part of my job is to be satisfied that my technicians get to go home the same way they came to work with no injuries and also seeing a smile on everyone faces when there's no out of service equipment."
good,Call center for vision tests and glasses or contact insurance coverage.
good,"Things have changed dramatically since 911. Very hard to non-rev on flights as an employee. You have to like stress, getting yelled at, and dealing with unhappy people. There are good points but there is a lot of stress."
good,"A typical day at work with Delta Air Lines is part ordering, receiving, stocking, shipping, packaging parts as well as maintaining inventory control. Handling of Hazardous Martials,Interactions with Mechanics, FAA, Ramp. Cargo, and vendor management. "
good,the best customer service experience you will get. difficult hours.
good,"Enjoyed every department that I worked for there at Delta.  It's a top rated airline with nice travel benefits although it's almost impossible to get on an aircraft these days as a standby but that's a positive effect since that's job security....full planes mean someones paying your salary."
good,"It was an experience not to forget."
good,Very busy atmosphere working with the public. Management is available for questions and assistance. Co-workers come from all backgrounds and are intersting to work with. The hardest part of the job is making all the right decisions within a given timeframe. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people every day.
good,The Airport is very demanding and fast paced. A good place to launch a Career in Customer Service
good,A typical day at work:
good,"Very easy to make friends at that learned a lot with computers, PDA systems and military time."
good,"Flexible and provide opportunity to explore technologies for business benefit............"
good,It is a bit challenging if you have never worked a physical demanding jub. But once you get the hang of the work it is fun and the people there are great too work with.
good,"Liked being there but DGS does Not pay well for Employees that work in distressed conditions, Tools & Vehicles that are not up to code, and a $9.00 a hour pay for employees doing excessive lifting, walking and also putting there life's on the line working with heavy equipment,  Poor pay = poor labor efforts, Delta has to hire a better company then DGS to take care of Planes"
good,Best part of working with this IT department was the benefit to fly non revenue. Management was the larger part of employee morale being up and consistently professional.
good,"Be willing to work holidays, nights, weekends and mandatory overtime some times.  The job is primarily a sit down job and you must be willing to attain and exceed metrics on a daily basis."
good,The best part of the job are the people and the overall culture. Delta people are resilient and the employees and customers are truly the focus of the company.
good,This job is the easiest money you'll ever make in your life. After the training that job is a piece of cake. Your coworkers make you feel welcomed in a friendly enviornment
good,Got paid good to throw bags around. Advancement is hard. Was there 6+ years and Business degree from college and still couldn’t get full time on ramp or a position in corporate. Besides that it’s great. Fly for free and profit shares every February we’re great!
good,"Your schedule changes every 3 months, so if you have kids this job is almost impossible! The pay is extremely low compared to other customer service jobs. I excelled at this company with little incentive to keep excelling. They offer free standby flights, so if you are a single person who doesn't have a family, this job is perfect for you!"
good,It was a good place to work. I enjoyed the flight benefits and such. The constant threat of the station being shut down was annoying but other than that everyone worked really well together.
good,Delta was a great company with lots of growth opprotunity. The only non union major airline in the industry gave employees flexibility. Very high seniority for employees which shows the loyalty that employees had for the company.
good,Fun job with travel benefits but can be hectic at times. Does not pay well and does not provide sufficient training to staff in the beginning. Poor management in different stations.
good,"I learned alot while working at Delta.  I extended my customer service skills with diversity.  This is a great company to work for.  "
good,Lets be clear unless you are working in the corporate offices of Delta the pay leaves much to be desired. The flight benefits are they only thing that make it worth it.
good,"the job is what you make it. consistency is key. there isn't a average about the job. its not rocket science .. but safety is first"
good,Customer Service. A job where you meet lots of people from all different walks of life. The work life balance is excellent. Everyone is very friendly including management.
good,"Great place to work, where employees are treated kindly and advancement is encouraged. Benefits are amazing and the work environment is great. Its more like a family atmosphere."
good,I was young when I worked here. I loved it at first but after the events on September 11th 2001 I had a hard time and took a leave. Then when I came back it was never the same for me. I did love the work but I kept flying and doing a great job at it while getting my New York Real Estate License and moved on from there.
good,I've worked for Delta Air Lines for 4 years. I work in the Logistics department. It has it's ups and downs with little room for advancement. It's a great job but I think it would be better if I was in a different department.
good,they do not provide enough money for the work that we do. The flying benefits are good but cant enjoy because of low pay. also takes 5 plus years to even be considered for full time.
good,"HNL station , great co workers, management needed some help here and there. Overall , great experience. I would recommend family and friends to apply for DELTA - they have great flying benefits too."
good,Working at Delta was a fun place to work.  You were able to receive travel benefits.  Travel around the world and discount within the travel industry was a plus.
good,Delta overall is a great company but the BOCC doesn’t have the same culture and atmosphere as working for corporate. Advancement is very difficult to achieve.
good,"Overall good place to learn the basics of the airline industry.  Training is a bit much to be desired.  When hired new employees should get basics the first week, then go away for training, then come back to finalize training.  Training should not be haphazrd"
good,"All managers and coworkers like my work , yet I cannot advance due to not having family that worked there before. "
good,A typical day at work is helping passengers check in and get on their flight in a timely manner. I have learned to think on my feet and resolve all problems. Meeting people from all over the world is the greatest part of the job. The management time worked together with their peers and the workplace environment is very inviting and warm.
good,Hard werken en een goed salaris zijn de pre. Om de zoveel tijd word de manier van werken volledig op de schop gegooid. Gaat erg goed met de tijd en ontwikkelingen mee.
good,"-team work when having the right crew members"
good,"Excellent co workers"
good,"Delta was a great place to work but if you are hired as a contractor, they never hire you on full time, you get no paid time off or 401k benefits, and you get the worst working ours with no weekends off unless its unpaid."
good,"Tối mong muốn tìm 1 nơi làm việc ổn định lâu dài,mức lương từ 8tr trở lên"
good,I loved working as a team and would do anything for success.The family culture and wall look out for one another.we had a nice break room so we could take a rest or a workout room to keep us strong and fit.Als flight after flight after flight
good,"Demonstrated superior customer service skills by providing assistance to disabled passengers by ensuring their timely arrival/departure to and from flight gates at the airport."
good,One of the big airlines that have employees all over the world.  The company has a good mix of technical and analytical jobs.  This is a great industry if you like to travel.
good,Another great group of people and customers to work with. Challenging and rewarding workplace. Management was fair and work/life balance was good. Really liked the owner
good,"Feel proud to be a member of Delta's operation!  Only wish they would balance out the hard work a ramp agent does for a better work schedule as a Ready Reserve.  Since there are no health benefits and too low a pay to live on, another second job is necessary.  But for some reason, Seatac requires Ready Reserves to work 5 days of 5 hour shifts/per week (=25 hrs pay for 5 days per week!).  This leaves little room to coordinate another job, but you're struggling if you only work for Delta."
good,Productive place to work. i learnt a lot at this place. I would recommend this place to professional who are interested to work in the airline industry
good,"Busy, I learned a lot, management was great, the workplace culture was great, the hardest part about this job is that it was busy all of the time. I enjoyed this job"
good,"If you're not use to hard physical labor and you want to work for Delta as a Ramp Agent then my suggestion to you is ""GET IN SHAPE NOW."" It's a great company to work for but working on the ramp can be very stressful as well as dangerous. They are also very strict about being on time, being on time to them is clocking in minutes before your punch in time. If you clock in right on time, you are pretty much ""LATE.""  Overall if my body was ready for that type of physical labor in the hard of winter, I would love to return if they allow me to."
good,The organization operates like a family.  Employees tend to stay with the organization for years.  Management is lenient and have faith in the employees without micromanagement.  Overall very professional and business focused.
good,"It was a Great 7 year work experience in my life."
good,I loved working there but it was a very stressful and strenuous job especially over the holidays. When you are new it can be very overwhelming and quite the adjustment from a =regular job. You are expected to work every weekend and on holidays for years and everything is seniority driven so the longer you are there the better it gets.
good,Great place to work. It is a way of gaining experience in a busy work environment as well as dealing with people every time. It is fun to work at delta
good,Learned a lot  about digital and marketing space. The Delta brand is good for keeping up in how to treat customer and improve the customer experience.
good,"Researched maintenance records for the company and other regulatory agencies."
good,"I was a cargo agent that was in charge of shipping and receiving goods from international to stateside, from animals, human remains, hazardous materials to basic goods"
good,I wish I didn't have to leave but things don't always go to way you plan them.  They are family oriented and care for their employees very much.  You do your part and they will do theirs.
good,"Empresa con buen ambiente laboral, idóneo para el aprendizaje de cualquier persona que esté empezando en el sector del transporte aéreo de mercancías."
good,I worked at Delta Airlines as a Baggage/Ramp Operator. I worked in concourses all across the Atlanta Airport loading and unloading planes in a safe and efficient manner. I also worked as a Transfer Bag Driver. I delivered bags to their flights while focused on time departures and arrivals.
good,Good opportunities with company. Self motivation is highly encouraged. Good overall company to start and retire with. Management can be very encouraging for employee progression.
good,I was a very happy delta employee until red tape caused my thoughts of the company to change. i worked for them for a few years until i joined the military and went on military leave. Then i was accused of lying to the company and told i could never work there again due to not understanding the leave policy.
good,"Worked with great people at a great company. Learned a great deal about how to manage customer experience, on great days and challenging weather/delay situations."
good,"productive , exciting place to work , meeting new and existing employees , I learned to balance my work day and deal with people of all backgrounds , the hardest part of the job was dealing with strong firm attitudes that was not right but wanted to be right , the most enjoyable part was staying busy all day"
good,The company is great to work for- They offer so many benefits for the employee and their families. The pay is not bad however there are times when you struggle to have a work life balance.
good,I couldn't do the constant shift changes and round the clock scheduling anymore. But as a company the atmosphere and enthusiasm is contagious. People have worked there for decades for a reason. And flight benefits are awesome.
good,"During my time with Delta Air Lines, I learned a lot about the industry and was able to travel all over the world, which was a wonderful perk, but due to work schedules it was difficult to find time to travel as much as I would have liked."
good,One of the best experiences of my life. i got t get up and personal with aircraft and be on the other side of the tsa check lines.
good,Management has lots of overhead.  employee to contractor ratio is 35/65. very little practice of innovation or newer technology.Project turn around time is very long and at least 1/3 more labor cost than industry.
good,"Promotes professional growth, good place to work. Co-workers will help you learn your job. Management will make sure of your safety in your work place. Learned how to work as a team."
good,"Delta is a good company to work for over all.  Just like every company they can have some problems with supervision, but over all good to work for"
good,"Delta is an awesome company for entry-level workers.It is also a fun place to work.There are several opportunities for advancement, as well as great benefits."
good,"Ready Reserve (part time)"
good,working for delta airlines is a great experience and the benefits were a plus. But at times taking control of most of the flights that come in and out was a tough thing to do.
good,Delta does not promote from within the more qualified people. The good old boy/girl system is still alive and well. Preferential treatment is given to personnel who have been through black belt training over college educated personnel.
good,"Delta Air Lines was a thrilling company to work for. Each day I felt that my contributions would reach the front lines, making a meaningful impact, whether it was changes made in customer facing systems or employee facing systems."
good,"Hard-working, happy co-workers; intellectually curious, but pragmatic. Many of us traveled together. What else can I say? Would recommend Delta to anyone. Great experience."
good,"great job, demanding work, loved working outdoors. Wish the pay was a little better and not too many hours. All together a great place to work and a great airline. LOVE the flight benefits."
good,It was a job that allowed me to earn money in my own time whilst at university trying to study for my masters degree. I met lots of interesting people.
good,good review a hard working job making money. really enjoyed the hours and great people to meet on a daily basis. a nice job to have.
good,"Some love it, some do not."
good,Good overall company. Great benefits and perks. Great discounts for other companies outside of the airline. Profit sharing . Keeps you on your toes.
good,"The co-op program at Northwest Airlines was flexible and efficient."
good,My experience as an Aircraft Mechanic was all phases of routine and  non-routine maintenance on the DC9-30/40/50 including sheetmetal repairs in the ATL overhaul hanger. I also filled in as mechanical lead when he was out. I transferred to Delta in 2000 because I wanted to stay in Atlanta where my family lived.  Northwest talked about closing the hangar down my whole time there which did occur in 2003.
good,"My experience was on Delta's aircraft as an aircraft mechanic on Boeing 727,737,757,767,and 777 and MD88/90 and MD11 which comprised of aircraft routine and non-routine maintenance and overhaul on landing gear, flight controls, cabin, wing, engines, zonal inspection, servicing, pre-flight, post-flight, and aircraft towing.  Recieved RIF notice in Apr. 2006."
good,"I worked in base mx and C-ck line at Delta which our job was to perform mx on line aircraft that could not be done at the line, such as landing gear and engine replacement, fuel tank mods, interior replacement mods, and ground mx accident repairs. In the C-check line we performed the 5 day inspection checks. My training  was mostly landing gear and flight controls, but I helped on engine replacement and fuel tank mods. I was trained in class on the 757,767,777, and MD88. My co-workers were great and worked hard as I did to meet the schedule. The hardest part of the job was helping to change an engine on the MD-11 #2 which was in the vertical fin and greasing the rudder using a bucket lift. The most enjoyable part of the job was to work for Delta and experience the airline world. After bankruptcy, the Airline has made huge strives to come back and make a great airline again. Paid more than half of their debt off and instituted profit sharing in place of their frozen pension system."
good,I enjoyed my time here. It's terrible that we have lost our contract after 18 years.  But I learned a lot with this company.
good,Being a representative for Delta Airlines is a very rewarding position.  Providing excellent customer service is the easiest part of my job.  Cons for this position can be the lack of communication between shifts.  Communication is one of the most important parts of a successful environment.
good,Airport work paced to fit flight schedule and operations. Coworkers highly skilled and made work worth doing. Company and coworkers more like family.
good,Great place to work and meet new people. I worked with a diverse groupie of people and enhanced my interpersonal skill and patience.
good,"Working as a flight attendant requires flexibility, patience, the highest level of professionalism and remaining calm under pressure."
good,Working at Delta on the ramp was a good cultural experience. The carcinogens in the air have a very distinguishable scent. The perks the job offers are great for those who want to travel.
good,Delta works hard to recognize their employees. Very fast paced environment. Great benefits offered. High expectations of employees.
good,Constantly changing work environment. The company works hard to take care of their employees and offers great benefits.
good,"Good company, good management team, Hardest part was the merger integration. It took many years to get airline on course after a merger but, afterwards it was great to watch it get its synergy."
good,"Friendly, hardworking environment. It is nice to work hard and have fun individuals around you in the work place. It makes us want to achieve higher goals for the company."
good,"physically demanding job.  Also taught time management, and accountability to make sure the planes were loaded and loaded properly and left at their scheduled times."
good,Delta was a great job because of the flight benefits. You have so many places you can choose from. You get to work outside.
good,On a average day my job consist of loading and unloading cargo on the aircraft making sure that the plane is balances to fly. Its a very fast and time management job which i like because it presents a lot of challenges for example getting all the numbers from fueling passenger counts and cargo to the pilot in a timely manner.  This is what i enjoy.
good,"Delta Airline is one of the best ten companies to work for in the world. With over 80,000 employees world wide. Delta takes care of its employees. Equal opportunity, it pays for employees Medical, Dental, Vision and 401K saving. Delta also provide profit sharing to all its employees at the end of the year."
good,"You will learn how to improve your customer service skills, learn to answer questions about the airline industry and you have the pleasure to work with some great people."
good,I loved this job because there was always constant change. I love a challenge and this job created that for me. Not to mention the free travel was a perk!
good,"There is not a typical day of work in the aviation industry.  Many issues can affect the operation, the one that is most common is weather. Not only weather in your city, but the cities your station services.  The industry will teach you to become a strong proactive thinker, and a person who can deal with frequent changes at any given moment.  Weather delays will require you to stay past scheduled shifts and not knowing your shift's exact end time can make planning life outside of work more difficult.  There is a perk that comes with the job, flying privileges that can be used to travel the globe."
good,Within DGS you have the ability to learn multiple skills and grow throughout the company in a timely matter if the effort is shown.
good,"Overall, this is a great place to work.  Busy travel days mean a hectic day at work, but the energy of the employees is always positive.  It feels great when you get the opportunity to brighten someones day with exceptional  customer service."
good,"Load and unload aircraft no matter the weather.  "
good,A company that is goal driven. Employees compensated for their work and growth is available to those interested in moving up.
good,"Very busy, and if you can handle working out doors this is a good place to work."
good,Loaded and unloaded planes and made sure the customers luggage made in on the plane in time.
good,I truly loved my job at Delta.  Great place to work. Co-workers were like family.
good,"I have learned alott about aircrafts working here, management has been great ,also.. My co-workers are all grea people, we all work together as a team to get our jobs done safely & efficiently. Hardest part of my job is dealing with rude customers,, Most enjoyable is my great customers who make up for the few rude customers we have come in to Delta cargo."
good,"It was a spacious and clean environment for the patients, I would interact with Insurance companies and give out money to the patients etc. It was quiet an the workers were given meals on a daily basis, my supervisor and other co-workers got alone and worked to take care of the patients and Insurance claims for patients on a daily basis. It was hard to find parking at the Nursing home. I enjoyed driving to work in 15 minutes it was convenient and I enjoyed some of the patients being nice to me."
good,Everyday is an experince. Working at the airport anything can happen. Working alone as well as working with a group of people to reslove an issue. You have to think quick and know how to handle all tasks that comes your way.
good,"I loved working here,  Lots of room for advancement and training."
good,as a ready reserve its hard to really make good money but the flight benefits are worth it
good,"Very nice place to work"
good,"I have enjoyed working for Delta for last 13 years, Over those  years I have had several opportunities to work in various department where I was able to learn different aspect on how airline industry operates"
good,"It was a great job, always working with a great group of people, always meeting new people, and seeing different cultures. The winters were really busy, the hardest part is delays or cancellations dealing with irate passengers who missed their flight, or not being able to get them out on time due to weather or mechanical issues, but its all about knowing how to deal with them, keep a smile on your face, and dont take anything personally. Everyday was was different, the best part about the airline business is making someones day, turning their bad day around or helping someone out with disabilities, makes you feel good knowing that your doing good for others in every way you can."
good,In this job I have learned excellent customer service skills and telemarketing skills. Management and my co-workers were very supportive and helpful.
good,"A very experienced staff."
good,i enjoyed this job it was a great place to work. The students were fun to be around
good,I enjoyed working for Delta. VArious jobs makes it difficult to discuss a typical day
good,You are able to learn how to operates many on the heavy machinery that is used on the ramp.
good,ignorance is bliss..average employee only cares about that paycheck.
good,Challenging atmosphere.  Good benefits.  Fast-paced environment.
good,Delta was a hard job but I enjoyed it. Meeting and greeting all of the travelers. Listening to stories of their travels was always something I enjoyed. I enjoyed my co-workers at Delta. They were very nice to be around. The hardest part was the flight cancellations and trying to re-book passengers.
good,"É uma boa empresa, porem apresenta deficit em diversos setores. A má organização da mesma, que é terceirizada, gera transtornos aos funcionários. Tais como: atrasos contínuos nos salários; atrasos contínuos nos benefícios; e cancelamento sem aviso prévio do plano de saúde."
good,Nice to work here. Great benefits. Caring management. Enjoyable job depending on the area you are assigned.
good,"It is a job where a learned something new every day."
good,I love working for Delta. It has a great work ethic.On a typical work day and it fast paced and very enjoyable. I learned about what happens behind the scenes in the airline business.
good,I was part of a sharp group of analysts that did highly value added work.  It was a very challenging but interesting work environment.
good,Excellent place to work and opportunities for advancement.
good,"Working for Universal and Homes INC was a great learning experience for me as it was my first job. I learned communication is key as I constantly had to communicate with clients making sure property bills, and property taxes were paid in a timely manner. It thought me responsibility and prioritizing as I had to manage my work load in a timely manner and have it approved by the Supervisor on a day to day basis. "
good,"Enjoyed working for Northwest airlines. Managment focused on Safe and on time performance while providing great customer service."
good,"Typical contractor work where billable client site varies and location, flexibility and work all change from contract to contract."
good,"After a quick briefing it was none stop lifting, pulling, towing, climbing and driving for quality customer service."
good,"My day would start out by finding equipment then fuel it everyday. Then I would usually have a flight on the ground or coming into the gate. The average flights your crew would work is about four inbounds and four outbounds but that depends on the aircraft your crew works such as narrow bodies or wide bodies. I have learned alot about aircraft such as weight and balances, push out aircraft, how to physically load and unlaod aircraft, how to communicate over a radio and to use many pieces of equipment. My co-workers were great I enjoyed all of them, this would be the best part of the job. Management was ok, but I had a couple of favorites. The hardest part of the job would be the stress, its a very physical job and you are on the go for the most of your eight and half hours."
good,Fun working around jumbo jets. you may gets some heavy flights (200-300 bags that you may have to deal with yourself) but overall tins if breaks in between.
good,Delta offers a great atmospher and wonderful benefits. Unfortunately the company does not place much face in young talent
good,"As a flight attendant I had the opportunity to travel both domestic and International. From the outside looking in, flight attendants have it easy but its a tough job with lots of responsibilities. I learned so much but the most important thing that I learned was how to stay calm in emergency situtations. In the air anything can go wrong so I had to learn how to keep calm under certain situtations. The management was good. As long as I did my job to the best of my ability they did theirs."
good,clean all things that were out of place or dirty around the plane
good,Marshal aircraft into proper gate and ensuring safe work enviroment. Unload bags to correct desination and upload bags to correct destination. Make sure plane is ready and ontime for depature.
good,"A typical day is getting to the airport, going through security, checking in at the flight attendant desk, getting your assigment, going to the gate to wait on the plane, prepping the plane for the next flight, doing pre-boarding orders, hanging coats, closing overhead bins, doing a beverage service (if time permitted), getting to the destination, and doing it all over again with a new group of passengers. The flight attendant life has some glamour on the outside, but it is hard work once you learn about the job functions. This job does not function like a typical 8- 5 job. I enjoyed the traveling and the flexible time off."
good,"Gerencia boa, mas sem perspectiva. Salario baixo."
good,Enjoyed working with everyone just did like all the shift changes but otherwise great place to work.
good,Great place to work if you like to travel.
good,"a empresa valorizou e reconheceu meu trabalho dando-me oportunidade de ter e aprender nova função,tendo incentivo e colaboração dos colegas de trabalho.A parte mais difícil do trabalho era fazer a limpeza do equipamento e a mais agradável era trabalhar em harmonia com os demais colaboradores do setor."
good,Provided customer service & ensured adherence to safety to in-flight passengers on domestic and international flights
good,"For the most part, this was a dream job. I thoroughly enjoyed the customer interaction, the varied locations to which I flew, the great crews with which I worked."
good,"A typical day at Delta is usually busy and full of the unexpected, with flight delays and passengers missing their flights. I have learned to stay positive when dealing with any type of passenger and no matter how angry the passenger might be, it is important to always stay respectful. My co-works are friendly just as all of Delta employees are, they come from all types of backgrounds and from all over the world. The hardest part of this job was my first month working. I was just learning the new codes and procedures but the passengers did not know that nor did they care. they wanted everything fast and at their finger tips. Over time I became extremely successful at my job and passengers would almost always walk away with a smile. The most enjoyable part of the job is the variety of passengers that comes in and out of the airport, and being able to impact their day in a positive way and hear some of their stories about where they are going and where they have been, and how much they love flying Delta Airlines."
good,The hardest part of the job was to upgrade to another position in the company.
good,"Interacted with contractors to onboard for the Delta Retiree Ready to Work Program. Management was very hands, available in the daily operations. Coworkers proved to be a great team and made the daily taks easier. The hardest part of the day was having to inform an applicant they were not selected for the position. The most enjoyable was helping the Delta retirees find contract position at Delta."
good,"Fun place to work ,good coworkers , popcorn machine. rotating days off."
good,"I move packages/ plane parts from one department to another. Mostly, we ship needed plane parts to other Delta hub stations around the world. I have gotten more in detail about the shipping process from start to ending."
good,"Typical day consist of working incidents, troubleshooting and making firewall changes , They have several bonding events for employees with concerts and special celebrity guest"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility with your schedule.  I also loved working with a fabulous bunch of flight attendants.  We worked as a team and had fun in the process.
good,It was a interesting place to work. Fun to see how the airline travel experience is from the other side. There only thing I didn't enjoy was having to stay for delayed or cancelled flights (sometimes hours)  even if my shift was over.
good,Co workers carry the atmosphere. Management can be abrasive at times but get better the more you understand where there’re coming from. Overall a good step in the right direction
good,"Delta has a great diversity and a lot to learn. It keeps you motivated to go to work the next day. It’s a teamwork environment, full of very friendly customer and staff."
good,"flying for delta for the flight benefits is fun and also an opportunity for future opportunities. with tons of options and flexibility, i highly suggest applying when you see open windows"
good,No question the perks of this job is flying the world for hardly anything. This is a great job for an adventurous person that's looking for an opportunity to visit places they never dreamed of going to.
good,Very hard to get a full time position it may take up to 7 years or more to get a full-time. Cap of hours and no benefits. The next nly good benefit is flight benefits.
good,"A great way to learn many different skills and meet people from around the world.  Opportunities for job development are available, however, usually require you to reside in Atlanta, GA."
good,Productive and nice people to work with. Very manual processes due to the technology not being advanced based on other company's HRIS.  Flexible work schedule in the Global Mobility area was not offered.
good,"I was only able to work for Delta for a year because you had to bid for your shifts based on seniority and I was the last person they hired, so when I got my new shift it was one I couldn't work, so I had to leave.  I would still be there today if that hadn't happened.  The flight benefits were worth the job there.  Even though they pay was low and they didn't offer benefits, it was worth it to stay for the flight benefits.  If they had different shifts to help out employees who had another job to compensate their wages, it would have been the perfect job."
good,I enjoyed working at Delta (ex-Red-Tail) and took an early retirement package as I opted not to relocate to Atlanta after the merger.  I was in an analytical capacity in Tech Ops and was treated fairly and my work was appreciated.  I liked the leadership despite the last couple years of turmoil when NWA was going to be disbanded.  It was a stressful environment at times but the work was rewarding and you were part of a great team.
good,"There's multiple departments in Delta however they all get the same great flight benefits. As a flight attendant I was away from home more than half the month because I flew a lot of hours however the pay was great."
good,"Solid airline, however current staffing model has contractors performing in crucial company positions with limited benefits."
good,"I would've never had the opportunity to view the world the way I have. At the end of the day, its a job, its a corporation, there will be bull, but the rewarding experiences traveling the world gives is so worth it."
good,Delta is a good place to work if you fit into their culture.  Many times there was conflict between Management and Employees that was portrayed publicly.
good,"A typical workday was very busy and high-paced. I most frequently was looking to be put in positions that require me to learn something new because I love to learn. I received a GSC certificate, as well as jet bridge certification. I often asked to be used in many positions during any given day because I think that its very important to be hard working. I also took on shifts of others in hopes that I would get a day paid back if needed, although almost always that never happened. There was an establishment of what the work culture was, but not every employee took that to heart day-in and day-out. The hardest part of the job was feeling the need to always please everyone, sometimes to a fault. Although I never fully used my benefits, I think the greatest benefit that being an employee of an airline lends is the travel benefit."
good,"New Ideas based on New requirements."
good,"Producing bridge beams and panels."
good,"I was terminated from the company after 18 years while trying to better myself, following all there rules that they apply when they feel necessary."
good,"A typical day at work is traveling across the world through a couple legs a day. If you have a great crew it is a lot of fun. It can be hard listening to complaints and putting out tons of fires a day. It is very rewarding when you get a fire put out, and get passengers to their destination safely."
good,"The culture and experience you receive at an employer like Delta are highly unique, but be prepared to accept a salary that does not match the cost of living expenses."
good,"A typical day at work starts with a briefing explaining jobs that need to be done.  I have learned a great deal at Delta and  I am thankful for the opportunity to have acquired the knowledge of Airframe and Power plant operations.  Delta maintained a controlled management style which is not always conducive for advancement.   Delta was and is on the rise to create a diverse work environment. Often times, I found the micromanaging high demanding days to be the most difficult, which often led to a quantity over quality mindset which allowed for more error.  My co-workers, profit sharing and the travel benefits, not to forget the appreciation lunches, often made me feel appreciated and is what I found to be the heart of Delta Airlines, and greatly appreciated."
good,A day at Delta is unpredictable. Customer demands and expectation has to be managed every time. Every situation is different and cannot be predicted. The anger and stress change according to how good one meets it.
good,"A 5 hour work day. Load and offload about 4-5 flights. Took about 45 minutes to 1 hour to work each flight. I learned to to operate in a fast pace environment and how to read and do reroutes. Management was good. Fair, and was willing to work with you. Workplace was great. Very supportive, and everyone showed great teamwork. Hardest part of the job was when the flights got delayed and we had to reroute the bags. Most enjoyable part of the job was stacking the mail and the bags inside the bin. I always love a good workout."
good,"It is a fast pace work environment where a person has to manage working in the elements such as the heat, the wind, the cold and the rain. Work load varies from light to extremely heavy."
good,"I worked in three separate contracts at Delta, for two different managers. The first manager (HR IT and RES IT) was fantastic and would really go to bat for you. My last manager (TECHOPS IT) would not."
good,It is a nice workplace with a lot of opportunities. However the management is really poor l. They only look for numbers and how their teams look but not the advancement of the specialists.
good,"I took numerous calls daily to assist with members flight Itineraries. While taking these calls I learned how to be more empathetic to peoples issues and concerns. If there were any questions or concerns I was unable to resolve they have a great support system in place to help get the answers."
good,"Delta Air lines is a good company to work for.  The work can be stressful and the environment can be competitive, but the experienced gained is invaluable."
good,Working for Delta Air Line is a wonderful experience.  My ultimate work goal is to become a Flight Attendant.  I am currently working to achieve my goal.
good,"Every day is different in the airline industry due to so many uncontrollable factors.  A storm in Minneapolis can cause problems in Detroit, power outages can disrupt the entire system.  Sometimes all flight run right on schedule and your day is somewhat boring.  The next day, you may not have time to grab a much needed cup of coffee.  Overall, I absolutely LOVED my time!!"
good,"Delta Airlines is a great company to work for."
good,"Its a fun job as long as you love dealing with stress. You have to make sure the flights go out on time and with accurate number of passengers. assign seats, adjust seats, print pilot and flight attendants paperwork, board the flight and dispatch the flights."
good,a typical day at work comprised of checking you terminal gate for FOD and all GSE equipment then preparing for you next arrival or departure by checking the cargo loads and marshalling the aircraft into the gate or loading the plane according to the ramp worksheet and marshaling the aircraft after providing the pilot with his weight and data record. the hardest part of the job was loading and unloading an aircraft that has been late to the gate and trying to get it out on time. the enjoyable part was the being outside and and getting planes to different destination on time. the workplace culture is okay meaning start the day how you left it without any injuries
good,Not enough room for advancement.   Sometimes easy to get stuck in one position for a long time.   Ofren times you are stuck doing the same thing and hard to move up
good,It is very difficult to move with in the company to a merit position that does not keep you on the phone 8 hours a day. I have and MBA and have been trying to move to the General Offices and cannot even get an interview. One needs to know someone to move in the company. The people I work with  are great!
good,"the airlines are a great place to work for travel benefits and to learn a new industry, but it is a tough job with it being outdoors, odd hours, and heavy lifting, combined with time sensitive strict guidelines for arrivals and departures. Hard to move up into management as most are brought in from outside and the management staff here at Richmond is small."
good,"Extremely detailed work. Flight benefits are pretty great if you are an avid traveler, but it's a bit of a game to use them. Team-oriented, decent work. Building has state-of-the-art fitness center, cafeteria, and Wings credit union."
good,a great company to work for. the management was always there to support in any issue whether it was small or large. The salary was relatively low in additon to poor benefits
good,"buen ambiente con personal de trabajo, inestabilidad en liquidadcion"
good,If you need a part-time job and can live off of part-time work and love to travel this is the perfect job for you. If you are looking to quickly move to full time work seek another employer. It can be upward of 5 years before you are moved up to full-time.
good,"May not be able to pick your base for the 1st 6 months"
good,I love the company and have a wonderful experience while I was single. I could work up to 14 hrs. a day on 5 day trips and have a good time. I loved my coworkers and I will miss Delta. I am married with 2 small children so that is why I want a job on the ground. Being a Delta flight attendant was the best time of my life.
good,"Delta has different corporate cultures across their different business functions, but everyone that works there wants to be there.  Delta tends to go through rough patches, but is proving to have what it takes to come out on top.  Delta is very rewarding to its employees and truly shows that they believe that the employees are their most valuable asset."
good,The people of Delta Air Lines have a true family spirit but the organization as a whole lacks true advancement opportunities that reflect genuine diversity.
good,Great hustle job. Just remember tips are your bread and butter so learn how to get it while you can. The tips season is from September till May so go and get it while the getting is good.
good,"i love delta, they care alot for their employees. I just started working for Delta and do not have much to say. However, I do know that this company is very well-organized and care for their employees."
good,This is a good place to work but not much room for moving up in the company. Co-workers are the best part of the job good people to work with.
good,"great overtime.and work shift overall good work enviornment"
good,"As already stated.  My fellow flight crew members (including the pilots) are all incredible, hard working, talented individuals.  It takes a special kind of person to have this career for any length of time.  And I mean that with only the most positive spin.  "
good,It was a difficult and demanding job which required a lot of knowledge and adaptability. The customers were generally a pleasure to service. The travel benefits were a definite plus.
good,"La jornada laboral comenzaba a las 8 al ingresar ordenar las funciones y el trabajo de cada quien organizar los elementos de corte y empezar a trabajar, hacer conteo y entregar inventario, aprendí a trabajar en equipo y bajo presión aprendí a relacionarme con mis compañeros de manera grata, haciendo mejor el ambiente de trabajo, aprendí sobre corte de diferentes tipos de materiales para inflables, obtuve conocimiento acerca de la publicidad, trabaje con muchas chicas que llegaban por días cuando había mucho trabajo, aprendí de cada una de ellas diferentes habilidades eran muy agradables;la parte mas complicada era cuando llegaba mucho material y había poca gente tocaba quedarse mas horas no remuneradas y ser ágil para entregar el pedido, no me agrado el  hecho de que pagaban muy poco y era demasiado trabajo."
good,Great opportunity to gain access to fields you wouldn't normally apply to. Great flight benefits! Weekly pay! Health benefits are not that great.
good,"Love working here, very friendly and helpful team.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday and hearing their adventures and helping the passengers."
good,Great Airline just closed too soon...when they mergered with Delta I was not able to re-locate. By working in several areas I was able to learn so much!
good,Delta is an amazing company. Managers are great. Hardest part of the job is the ignorant customers. The most enjoyable part is the flexible schedules and standby flights.
good,"Ensured information for distance learning programs was distributed worldwide to 1,200+ pilots.  Compliance with training required by company policy and FAA regulations.  Researched and recommended CD companies and arranged delivery.  Set-up CD burning, arranged fleet order. "
good,A typical day would be answering phone calls and assist customers with their travel needs. The co-workers are great and majority of the management is easy to work with. Nothing is hard as I enjoy helping the customers to my best abilities.
good,A very rewarding job that develops skills that actively supports a progressive organisation.
good,exciting adventurous day..its never a dull moment.  Like everywhere else it has its ups and downs.. You will definitely learn to hold your composure.
good,"Lifting, loading, unloading and helping transport to and from the planes baggage, mail, and cargo up to 200lbs. Participating in Summer Ready Reserve Program. 40 hours/week"
good,World issues and politics play into the day-to-day operation...very interesting
good,"making people happy while they travel was fun , It made work fun."
good,"The experience gained during FAA Part 139 inspections is priceless.  Having worked in an environment heavily regulated by SOP's, Regulations, and Manuals proved to be advantageous for me.  My initiative, eagerness to learn positioned me quickly for promotion and gained the trust of the governing body to make me interim in the absence of the past Director.  I enjoy the hands on experience.  However, my present position is all inclusive which has given me experiences beyond my job description.  Knowledge is power."
good,"This company is good to work for, Just the management needs a little reorganization. Most of the Co-workers are knowledgeable"
good,Working for delta is a great experiece but its what you make of it. The workers here all are alright to work with. I enjoy it for the most part i just wish it came with more benefits.
good,Overall Delta is a great company to work for and I really enjoyed the flight benefits. No negative words to say about Delta Airlines
good,"Start work at 4:00am, greeting and checking in passengers. Working under pressure and time constraints, maintaining passengers travel and ensuring on time departures.  While working at Delta I have learned how to multi-task, how to go beyond the call of duty.  I learned keen customer service skills.  I acquired managerial skills, and gain experience on how to make things run smoothly, in times of distress.  The hardest part of my job, is disappointing the passengers when a flight has been disrupted due to mechanical failure or weather, and trying to accommodate passengers, with little or no success. Also the lack of opportunity to advance in the smaller stations.  I enjoy working for Delta, because of the skills I have acquired, and the way they stay true to their employees after they had to file bankruptcy.  When they emerged from bankruptcy, they provide so many perks for their employees.  Delta benefits and pay is outstanding."
good,This was a good company to work for. Took good care of the employees
good,A typical day is not typical. I would walk in the door hoping to get 10 things completed for the day and than reality would hit and all priorities would change.
good,"Learned many job functions, and enjoyed the experience of being NWA"
good,"Everyday is different, fast paced, time sensitive and sometimes it can be a little stressful but in the end its worth it. Delta has tought me, to stick to it and never give up. Learning all the ends and out of working a flight is an on going task, giving good customer service was the first and most valuable lesson tought me."
good,"Load and Unload aircraft that are assigned to your team,"
good,"O meu ultimo emprego era um dia com muitos desafios pois não avia rotinas, com isso aprende a lhe dar com o imprevisto, sempre prestando atenção ao que era sugerido pelo meu supervisor, tentando ser solicito com os amigos de trabalho sendo que a parte mas difícil era a urgência dos documentos em tão pouco tempo entre a recepção e expedição porém sendo sempre elogiada e reconhecida pelo meu trabalho."
good,company sold to Delta and company no longer exists got laid off reduction in force
good,"great on an executive level, poor on operations level, great employee focus great benefits , poor on time commitment and work life balance.  Ed Bastin is a phenomenal CEO."
good,"The only thing I have to say is we needed more training and the more experienced associates didn't want to help us out! If you are into aviation, you might want to consider this job but definitely not for me."
good,You have the ability to bid on shifts quarterly. And you are also able to fly for free. They constantly have customer service events to keep morale high.
good,"Use x-ray scanners to check items for signs of unauthorized materials. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Delta and learned thing vertical and horizontal as well,"
good,"Its a Awesome Experience, great training great Vacation packages and flying benefits. Its has been one of my favorite jobs I have work. Definitely"
good,"Great company and culture, reflected in the great performance of the company. I left for career advancement. I do not regret leaving, and would love to work for DAL again."
good,"It was really great working here."
good,Delta is an old company with an older work force. Change is hard to make happen within company's culture. Benefits are above average but not the best. Their design and branding department is severely lacking.
good,It was a very physical work environment did a great deal of manual labor once they removed the conveyor belt from the premise it was very challengingly
good,"Delta and Northwest Airlines were great places to work, however I have to admit Northwest Airlines was my home. I thought I would retire from NWA. Even though we were union employees, we had a sense of job security and fairness. I felt as though I could be more independent in my decision making. We were given tools so that we could process, accommodate and/or provide amenities for each and every customer at first contact. "
good,"Typical physical labor job, great comrades and co-workers, combination of full time and part-time workers. Management   could use an overhaul but decent."
good,"Delta was a great company to work for, but it did take away from my time with family.  Did not like the fact that all my holidays would be working for a number of years and missing so many of my sons events."
good,"There is plenty to be learned at Delta Cargo because it deals with a very different aspect of the airline industry. It is sort of a double edged sword in that you can learn as much as you want to, but some people learn as little as they need to, which can be frustrating at time. But I suppose that's present in any job environment. "
good,Very fast paced environment.  Often times had to make quick desicions and deal with angry passengers who missed flights or lost luggage.  Meet new people everyday
good,"I enjoyed working for Delta.  Excellent benefits, excellent staff, fast paced.  The company made some shifts in management that were questionable but otherwise Delta was an excellent compnay."
good,Team work is awesome here. Have learnt a lot here but growing up within your field is impossible here. No job security. Learning new technology is not encouraged.
good,"Trying to explain the job of a flight attendant is not easy. There would be trips that went exactly as planned and then there were trips that were completely chaotic.  I learned about how to be flexible with this career. The hardest part though was getting to and from work since I didn't live in NYC. The friendships, locations, and coworkers were the best parts of the job."
good,Free flights. Can't beat it. I wouldn't recommend the culture. Short lunch breaks. Management is usually pretty bad. But did I say flying first class internationally was amazing?
good,It was enjoyable for the brief time I was employed by the company. I was hired yet the recruiters weren't honest about the company wanting to restructure or that I wasn't a 100% fit. It was demoralizing and I lost my job due to restructure after a large group of assistants were also let go months before due to restructuring. It is a good company just wasn't a good experience for me.
good,You meet all type of people some pleasant some not so pleasant. The job is very fast paced. The hardest part of the job is the hours.  For me is the most enjoyable part of the job was the people I met.
good,"Seniority rules here if you are a flight attendant.  That being said if you understand how the company operates and you are okay with not having much control over your working life until you get to a certain level of seniority then this place is probably not for you."
good,"Typical day and work was to come in check emails, pull reports, get started on entering data or correcting problems."
good,"Delta is a great place to work, management could be a little bit more proactive in everyday operations and see to needs of the employees.training is good always up to date with new changes.would love to work for the company again if given the opportunity."
good,"Their Ready Reserve position is great for someone just looking for flight benefits. If you want full time it takes a long time to get it. So be prepared for a 2-4 year wait till you get full time. Most specialized positions open first for full time. Its a great place, but has issues just like any job. But overall its a great company."
good,"Fun job but certainly not a career. Expect to have a lot of downtime but when a plane is to arrive it gets very hectic and fast paced, which can be a good thing and working around planes is amazing"
good,Met many different individuals that helped to further the great experience that I had working with Delta.  The everyday experience was enhanced as this was a position that enabled me to deal directly with customers where on my previous position was not in that point of contact.
good,"The team I was part of was very engaging, even after my contract ended we still stay in touch. Contract rates were low comparatively in the area. Company in general believes it holds more leverage than it does these days. More competition for talent in the area now. HEAVY H1b Visa work force."
good,Delta is a very good place to work for the airlines if you is interested in having flight benefits. I learned good management skills working for delta airlines. A typical day at work consists of working on flights all day long wether you is on the ramp or in bag room.
good,This company is about who you know in order to get ahead. If you are not a social butterfly then you will not advance. If you are then this is the place for you.
good,"overall, Delta Airline was a good company. the work ethics were on point and the crew were helpful. one thing i must say is the perks were amazing! having the ability to travel the world made it worth working for."
good,"overall, it was not a terrible place to work, I met a lot of great people and enjoyed my time there. best part was the flight benefits. there were a lot of different jobs you could switch to and try if you didn't like the one you had."
good,"Delta is an excellent place to work for both the youthful and the more seasoned. The typical day may be fast paced but it is paced. While most warehouse/industrial careers tend to be predictable Delta offers a mix of options including the freedom to arrange your schedule, swap shifts, and work in completely unrelated areas. Add the travel perks of the job and you have yourself a way to let your bad weeks go once you hit the sands of your travel destination."
good,We never really have a day where we have a full staff. Just 1 break on a 10 hour shift. Super busy on Thursday and Friday. Too many different managers in the course of a week.
good,Looking for more professional development for middle management. There is definitely an opportunity to develop more work/flex options in the future. Company c-suite is amazing! You can't beat the Delta culture.
good,One of my best jobs with regretfully little chance for career advancement. I loved my independence and possibility to travel extensively. I would go back for the right terms and conditions.
good,"Great way to interact with customers and being able to help them with booking flights and their issues they had with the airline. It was never a boring day because every call was different and unique. There were times I had fantastic customers and had the pleasure of helping, and there were some that was stressful. But it made the job even more interesting."
good,I was there 10 years and still had to work the rough shifts. I have several co workers that's been there 20 plus years and still working them. They're benefits and compensation  is great but the hours were my only complaint.
good,The organization focussed on reinventing itself in the midst of a changing environment that included low cost carriers. The organization witnessed low productivity from concerned employees during this time period.
good,"Sometimes you are assigned to a busy gate and get heavy flights in and out all day long, creating a physically demanding atmosphere, whereas other days you may see only one light flight with minimal work to do. Each day is different and I liked the diversity of the job and the obligation changes based on your location that day."
good,"Tôi cảm thấy khá hài lòng với công việc, tuy nhiên nơi làm việc khá xa khiến tôi khó khăn trong việc đi chuyển"
good,"Can be great. But with no benefits except free flights and only 1400 a year allowed to work, will need another job. Can't be only bread and butter. Will need second job to support family. Great if single and expenses are low."
good,"Not the most luxurious job, but there are benefits if your're willing to put in the work. This will be mostly done outside in all weather conditions and will have you lifting a considerable amount of weight each day. Besides the work load the job does pay pretty well, with a decent bonus every year and plenty of opportunities for overtime."
good,"Self managed"
good,"I started working here when I got out of high school. Northwest airlines was great family style atmosphere to work in. everyone was that brother, sister, mom, and pop asking you  how your doing whats going on. you know the people who cared about you. After the merger with Delta it turned dark. It became more about the almighty greenback from the management angle. You were no longer a person. You became a number that could be let go of by the snap of a finger. The job started to squeeze the life out of people. If a plane was push out 2 minutes late due to air traffic control it became the baggage handlers fault. and you were reprimanded for something not even in your control."
good,It was a quick catch on they help you as long as you want to work  and be productive. The workers were good thet have some leniency as long as your numbers are met
good,ok it could have more full time or part time available to the new workers. it takes way too long to be promoted from ready reserve to a full time or part time.
good,Comair-Delta Connection no longer in business.  Was once a great place to work until Delta put them out of business.  It was a sad day when Comair had to close its doors.
good,World travelers and veteran employees give this company a very positive and unique culture.  Flight benefits are amazing yet require shift trading to utilize.  Advancement in the company almost always requires relocating to a new station.
good,"Enjoyed working there but job security isn't that good and sometimes they paid u late , and the distance to travel from home to site but all in all I liked working there"
good,"I worked mostly away from headquarters; a challenge was the time difference.   Some colleagues had not traveled internationally and weren't aware of the differences that affected our jobs.   The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting colleagues in different countries, living abroad and learning new cultures."
good,"I loved being a flight attendant and Delta was the best in the business.  This career was not just a job, it was a lifestyle that had great benefits, paid well and allowed me to travel to every state in the United Stated, all over Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribean, and many European countries,  The hardest part of the job was 911."
good,"Fast paced environment, one minute i'm working on two iPads for glass repair, next I could be driving to Kentucky for a service call for CNC serial controller repair. Always busy, always something to do. For 8 of the 13 years I traveled to thousands of calls ranging from residential to industrial systems, servers, routers, vpn, special software systems company specific. Enjoyed the challenge of not knowing where I was going next and most systems were unique to the company I was being called to. My job was to reverse engineer the networks and / or software because most company IT was subcontracted out and no one knows how it was designed. Late night onsites were rare but did occur. The owner was great guy but demanding, all in all I would work for him again."
good,I really enjoyed working for Northwest Airlines. I was part time Ramp assistance. For a part time job I made quite a bit of money. The job had really good benefits. I was laid off before the merger with Delta.
good,"Great place to work, would recommend. A great CEO and culture.  Organization is effective and work/life balance is what you make it."
good,"The pay and benefits are superior to any other company I've worked at, and my colleagues love what they do.  However, if you're not a pilot, flight attendant, mechanic, or baggage handler, you need to be in ATL to survive long term.  Ironically, even though they're a global company, Delta seems to think that ATL is the center of the universe, and everyone and everything needs to be there.  So beware if you hire on anywhere other than ATL."
good,"delta airline was a very good company to work for doing the time I was there. I have learned to work at a fast pace , how important time is. working with so many different people. learning not only the job but about benefits, stocks, etc. I learned also the right way to load and unload bags and etc. It was nice to see what all comes thru the airport."
good,"It's a good company to work at, opportunities to advance yourself. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility in work and days off. Management didn't always listen much. They said they would look into thing and then nothing
good,"sorry, due to sensitive information I am unable to speak with anyone outside of Delta about employment there"
good,My day started out by having a meeting and figuring out what needed to get done. After figuring out what air craft I was assigned I would go to the plain and complete a check list. While completing the check list if I needed parts for a repair I would order them. After receiving them I would repair the air craft and complete the repair paper work. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I made the customer's flights more enjoyable.
good,"Working at Delta airlines has always been a pleasure. Its a serious, profesional and organized company focused on excelent customer service without forgetting security, all in a very familiar work atmosphere."
good,excellent company to work for first two decades.declined considerably final years due mainly to problems in the overall industry.especially due to the farming out of jobs to unqualified and sometimes totally incompetant applicants.Made comraderie which was so important in early years pretty much nonexistant. do not know what the situation is since my retirement..truly hope it has gotten closer to what it was when it was a joy to come to work.
good,"Great people,"
good,"Get to travel a lot which is a plus.  Management was decent.  Advancement is hard you have to be there a few years.  Everything is seniority based.  Schedules at not the best, but it is in the service industry and is opened all the time, so it is/was expected."
good,Delta Airlines is now the old Northwest Airlines.  It's the wonderful people that make it special.
good,Delta is a great place for growth and leadership goals. You can travel and work with some great people. Lots of great benifits.
good,Every 6 months employees have the option of switching positions within the company. There are many positions considering Atlanta is the main HUB. I work with a diverse group of people and we all share our cultural difference and learn from one another. What I've learned in this company exceeded my expectations. I enjoy coming to work to some of the most positive people and with positive attitude and the job itself is fun.
good,A typical day at work starts with the supervisor dividing the employees into teams of 4. He usually puts someone in charge of the team. Each team would then have to work 4 or 5 flights per shift.
good,Opportunity for avancement is very hard. But it is an excellent company to work for. The benefits are great and the structure of the company is great.
good,"typical day is a very busy on the line maintenance , alot of flights coming in and out. You have excess to alot of references and manuals to get your a/c back in service.The hardest part is knowing up to 11 different aircraft coming to your gates.the best part is working on the latest and greatest aircraft in service."
good,"Although Northwest Airlines, at its peak, employed 65,000 employees, all over the world; the airline still maintained a small-company feeling.  I've not had the same perception of it's predecessor, Delta."
good,"Work with Business and IT teams to collect requirements, brainstorm solutions to make the operation more efficient and profitable through automation."
good,"A typical day consist of meeting new people from all over the world. Assist with all their travel needs. Meeting arriving aircraft's. Being apart of a departing aircraft boarding process and multitasking at great speed in a efficient and respectful manner. The team of people I worked with were amazing and full of knowledge. "
good,"I worked 2nd shift. Operation was in full swing, I hit the ground running.  I was always early to monitor the operation.  I would be part of the team that would close the operation down at the end of the night. My management team was very supportive, they enjoyed helping when it was seen as a need.  The commute.  taking an operation that was in full swing and making sure it finished the way it started. perfect and on time."
good,It was a rainy day at work and an airbus A320 pulled into the gate. We had to unload 260 bags and load 220 bags in under 30 minutes. Me and the other agents worked together and got the job the done.
good,"Delta Air Lines was the best company I have worked with, as I enjoyed opportunities to advance, Enjoyed the professionals I worked for and with, and always looked for opportunity for growth. Of course, enjoyed the benefits with Delta through my career there.  As has been a consistent, most enjoyed taking care of customer needs, and resolving major grievances of customer inconveniences during air travel."
good,"This job was not difficult. It has unbeleivable benefits, including free flight benefits for my entire family. However, the hours were difficult due to they are a 24 hour call center. It became a burden on my family."
good,make airline reservation sales and take customer service support calls for delta airfrance and klm.
good,The most rewarding part of this job is also the fun part and it is in all the passengers we encounter on a daily basis. Being able to salvage someones otherwise messed up travel is very rewarding. Management makes it very difficult because the culture is no at all supportive. That makes coworkers very competitive with each other.
good,"running luggage out to planes, packing the planes, and helping to start the plains, sending the planes out. Overall an amazing place to work."
good,"I would say the job is what you make it ,the hardest part are the people you work with not the job at hand .I learned a lot about self control ,how to motivate and organize a large group of works"
good,"Exciting travel benefits.  Great customer safety and care training."
good,All in all it was a great job.  Doing both above and below wing work was a great experience.  Shoddy management was the only spoiler and unfortunately you have to work with them every day.
good,"Overall, my experience in revenue management has been a positive one.  Delta like most other airlines does layoffs every year or two as the industry booms and then busts.  But revenue management is one of the few areas of the company that is relatively immune from drastic layoffs."
good,"Fast paced, always changing. Able to work with many different divisions. Strong management and colleagues. Challenging industry."
good,"A typical day at work involved providing comfort and safety to airline passengers.  "
good,"So far, my experice in the air line industry has been a rather fufilling one.  As with any job, there are days where it can be hectic, and days where there is almost nothing going on."
good,"Boa empresa para trabalhar, pontualidade no pagamento e benefícios oferecidos, falta de reciclagem na forma de trabalho é a parte difícil. Bom relacionamento com os colegas."
good,"O periodo que trabalhei , gostei muito é uma empresa muito bem organizada"
good,my typical at work was taking customers from point A to point B
good,Great Colleagues! I have had a lot of growth moments and met a lot of great people of all levels. It was a pleasure being a part of One Great Team!
good,Very diverse co-workers and passengers
good,Working in the Shipping Department. I worked with many different aircraft parts. Shipping worldwide. I learned how to ship International to many different countries. I enjoyed working with managers and my co-workers. We worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was working 3rd shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a variety of work.
good,Unloading and loading UPS's air cargo. As airplanes landed we had a very precise amount of time to load and unload airplanes with packages. I was responsible for the traing of all new hires as well as managing and organizing all employees working during my shift. I conducted safety meetings covering a wide range of topics at the conclusion of each shift.
good,working in the winter is not fun. Outside on top of a jetway in freezing weather is not easy.
good,"Worked in the material handling location under the airport. The supply area was a high pace limited, break location and there was no time for lunch throughout the day. The shuttle from the parking to the airport in terms of schedule was very unpredictable."
good,I enjoyed learning more in depth about the industry while I was going to school for it. The free flights did not hurt either.
good,Delta Air Lines was not a bad place to work. The job became very stressful in times of weather conditions that hindered travel and in the area of baggage control.
good,Good place to work  people are friendly and you get to meet all kinds of people while performing your job they really try to help you succeed there all the time
good,Travel benefits are great but do not pay the bills. Good diverse culture but customer service schedule is all based on seniority. Environment is 24/7. Good leaders and usually motivate the people around them. Like most large companies it can be challenging to stand out as an individual or advance within the company.
good,Great company to work for pay is decent opportunities are there to move up and around if your willingness to move            ( literally) is there .. it’s fast paced constantly changing and can be intense at times. It’s very rewarding all and all but schedules can be rough in the beginning.
good,Company shows a sincere interest in employees and the solutions to their problems. Promotes life work balance and flexibility. Company also foster a harmonious and cooperative environment. Overall great place to work.
good,"very good to  learned new thing , like learned to wear clean cloth everyday , a lot cooking cleaning , learned  working together  with other  people . learned understanding management ,"
good,"Delta’s culture and all procedures and policies were vastly different, but I ended up there via merger, so had no voice in them. "
good,"Pros:"
good,Delta is a outgoing and friendly group of people. If you need help or maybe a shift switch there is always someone to help out. Love the flight benefits as well. I would highly recommend Delta to anyone.
good,"I enjoy my job at Delta and believe in the company's mission.  (they are and will continue to succeed).  It's not my mission to leave Delta however I have relocated and am embarking on commuting to work and frankly do not want that life long term.  "
good,"I use to love working in customer service until I had to deal with airline customers. The company overall is a great company, but dealing with irrational human beings daily was too stressful for me, especially from a remote area. Possibly could have tolerated more if I worked on site, but at the time working in office would not have been feasible for me and my family. Co-workers were nice and company was very inclusive even for remote employees."
good,"Great company, lots of work when you are in a call center. Helps with family and treats everyone like a family. Be prepared to work long hours. Great benefits"
good,"Doing physical labor in potentially extremely hot temperatures. Co workers and management are nice, but can be demanding. There are good benefits including profit sharing"
good,"Good place to work around people,  you have fun while doing your job and a good experience working around the airplanes and equipment, your coworkers teach you how to work them"
good,"strong culture and work is done strictly according to SOP's. strict policies and a simple mistake can get one fired."
good,"Excellent benefits"
good,I enjoyed working at delta but i hate the fact that when i was working there i was wrongfully accused of a situation that i did not do i wish i would have got a lawyer to handle it for me so i could still been employed
good,"Công ty có nhiều hoạt động bổ ích cho nhân viên, thường xuyên hỏi thăm nhân viên về khó khăn trong công việc để kịp thời giúp đỡ."
good,Do more with less has become the normal now. You can make good money but you will work for it. High stress from management. Work in ramp operations you will be exposed to all weather be prepared.
good,"I had a good time there. The management was kind and understanding. The employees are happy and bring a good attitude to work. My criticisms would be that I didn't like how structure their schedules. They can make make you work part-time but for 5 days a week for almost no benefits except free travel. Trading shifts was also very inconvenient. That is the ready reserve program. Training sometimes felt inadequate and rules sometimes felt not very well communicated. Was a good place to work, but I felt these other problems could be solved if Delta employees unionized."
good,"As a ramp agent, I typically was able to keep to myself. Waiting for luggage to come down the conveyor belt, I would then load it all into large transport carts. From there, I or someone else would drive them out to the flight to be loaded onto the plane by another individual. It primarily consisted of heavy lifting and sorting. Hardest part was working in the heat and the wear on your body from twisting, turning and lifting. I enjoyed the hard manual labor though."
good,"Great company to work for if you're planning on staying in the airline industry for a long time. Travel, travel and more travel!!! You get the opportunity to be able to travel the world and share the stories."
good,Multi fleet Airline with tons of work to always stay busy. Never a dull day for sure. Lots of room for advancement and training. Flight benefits always a plus.
good,"I worked for Delta for  6.5 years and really enjoyed working with some great people."
good,enjoyed airline atmosphere. i would work for an airline in the future always something to do receiving bags from checked passengers and loading them by destination onto the aircraftman and marshaling out aircraft to have pilot ready to start there moving to runway.
good,"The environment was one that I'd hope to find anywhere else -- many people who are task oriented, project minded. The technology is catching up to other industries that depend on IT for corporate stability... Virtualization, Cloud were initiatives still being vetted when I left."
good,Delta is a great company to work for. The environment can be stressful however the people in the company are constantly evolving to new policies and its an ever learning experience.
good,"Management has to take care of the politics. Other than that good place to work."
good,"I do not like the fact that every quarter, every project is looked at to see if is on budget.  If it is not, then the contractors on that project are let go."
good,I learned the difficulties of maintaining aircraft used for cfr part 121 operations (commercial airlines).   My typical work day was unknown when i went in due to my job of working on operational significant  aircraft down for maintenance.   The culture in my division was pretty laid back and more blue collar than white collar due to the nature of business were were in.
good,Seems like millennial have more advancement opportunities than any other generations.  Changing culture but still a good company.  Great benefits and nice campus.
good,"typical day was to check in flight, load baggage on flight and off load next flight, very laid back culture, most enjoyable part of the job would be the customer service."
good,"I loved being a flight attendant.  Welcomed the challenges and benefits with the job.  Always enjoyed the diversity and wide range of people i encountered.  Unfortunately for me my personal life going through a horrible divorce, forced me to make a decision to end my service as I was not giving my best to my job.  This was not fair to Delta/Mesaba, they deserved the best of me."
good,Great company.
good,"Enjoyed my time with Delta.  Learned a lot, but there are some pockets of lethargic management.  It could be much more energetic and aggressive.  Some managers are short-sighted.  But they genuinely care about their customers and safety."
good,A very great place to work with many achievable challenges.  The company values well qualified employees who have a desire to deliver quality products.  Senior leadership actually is involved in every level of the company.
good,"Fun and productive work place. Free flight benefits, though Im scared of heights and I didn't take out time to use them. I met new people. I also enjoyed the out doors. Great working outside, in the spring and summer"
good,"I look forward t going in to work each day because my co-workers are absolutely great people. However, the job is a time based position so people who have been there for years make a decent wage starting employees come in as part-time (ready reserve) and may have to wait 5-6 years for full-time employment unless your willing to relocate and there's no promise you'll be brought in to another station. This doesn't seem to be a performance based position."
good,I liked my job at delta and was able to advance several times in my time there. However there is always the inevietable slow down in aviation and it got me at delta.
good,I LOVED working for Northwest Airlines.  The training was thorough.  The people were friendly.  The only issue was that almost as soon as I was hired they were taken over by Delta and I was furloughed.  It was the best job I ever had.  I absolutely loved it.
good,Big office work area with many different divisions in one place. You get to meet a lot of different people and work with the different groupd on different projects.
good,"Delta's marketing department is a very fast-paced environment that has been undergoing structural change for more than a year."
good,"I initially worked for Northwest Airlines before Delta bought the company. In hindsight it was a good company to work for-shift flexibility; for the most part, working independently; and of course the flight benefits were amazing."
good,"I had the opportunity to assist the Delta Airlines Flight attendants with technical support for their hand-held device.  This device held all their Public announcements for their passengers as well as flight and menu information for each flight.  I maintained a weekly inventory that would submit to management. As well as answering/ sending emails concerning lost and found items or any questions from the staff. I loved the fact that I worked with people and that I had the opportunity to assist in malfunctions. Most of all I loved the teamwork that maintained us afloat. The hardest part of the job was when there were malfunctions that IT hadn't  found a solution for. However- thankfully, we always had a quick-fix (In the meantime)."
good,Delta was my first job.  I was a graduate of their programming class and went through several IT reorganizations.  It was during one of the reorganizations to create a new Travel Services company in partnership with AT&T that I left for another opportunity.  It never seemed right and struggled for a few years until the company folded and IT came back into Delta.
good,It was a good  environment. The  owner was from Michigan an dispatcher it could get confusing at times. I went to Atlanta 2 times a day for a year. Direction s an waiting on truck get back from night run. Paid cell phone bill. Learned to get name place where was going an figure it out night b4. I learned u don't want be lost downtown Atlanta.
good,"Loved working for Delta!  great company, great benefits, but unfortunately, my office closed and I did  not want to relocate to another city.  Hope I have such a great job in the future."
good,I worked night and was a contractor but I learned a lot and management looked out for us and ensured we  were informed and ready.  We were separated from the rest of the operations.
good,I loved working here. I appreciate how the co-workers and managers were so nice and caring to me. Everyone was always so happy and always greeted me with a smile.
good,"Buena compañía aérea americana, buenas condiciones. Al ser relativamente pequeña en España, pocas posibilidades de ascender."
good,"preparing for each flight to arrive and retrieve or deliver cargo "
good,Cool place to work and the pay keeps increasing.  You get to fly all over the world for free! The only complaint I would have would be the amount of time it take to advance being a ready reserve.
good,"I have been working at Delta Air Lines part-time (More than 3 years). Delta Airline is a cultured, caring, family feel environment. Everyone cares for one another and treat each other with dignity and respect. The pay is great and the atmosphere is fun."
good,Delta Air Lines was a great first job and a good overall place to work. At the time I worked there there was a concerted IT outsourcing effort which I know they regretted almost immediately after implementing and it has taken them almost 20 years to build that staff back up to 1990 levels.
good,"have to be willing to work especially summer time, lots of bags to load into aircraft and very busy and noisy environment. You will learn a lot as you go along."
good,Delta is a great place to advance and grow.  Learning the ins and out of the company assist with the development of your performance.  The overall culture is excellent.  The hardest part of the job is when others are not open to change.
good,"Exciting to meet new people all the time. Being apart of a team of professional, dedicated employees.  Traveling and seeing new places everyday is exciting, experincing new cultures."
good,Delta Air Lines is a very caring and customer relations oriented company! I enjoy the experience.  Management is very accommodating. Management is also very flexible with reporting hors and scheduling.
good,How to take care of people that was getting on and off the airplane.The hardest part is working in the rain but sometime that is fun because you get use to it.Just working to help other people that's what I like to do
good,"El trabajo en equipo es lo primordial, a pesar de malas fichas en el equipo, el trabajo se realizaba sin mayor obstáculo. Pero siempre se tenia el soporte de la gerencia para realizar los cambios adecuados y se cuenta con un plan de trabajo."
good,"Delta Air Lines is a good place to work.  Leadership firmly believes in the virtuous circle of putting employees first, employees take care of customers to earn repeat business which in turn satisfies the shareholders who pay our bills."
good,"A typical day is at least ten hours at the office and one to three hours at home.  Some airports operate 22 hours a day therefore I would receive operational email 24 hours a day.  Everyday is different and has a different set priorities.  In fact, priorities could change four or five times a day.  It takes a lot of communication between different departments and even different airports. Management is very helpful because everyone's goal is customer satisfaction.  The hardest part of the job is making everyone happy which customers direct employees and the different departments. The most enjoyable part of the job is the teamwork to achieve a common goal."
good,This job helped me to learn more computer skills and to be methodical and to be organized. This job was a good job to work at.
good,"Delta Airlines was a great job, and I learned the most in regards to job safety (OSHA) and general employee management relations, I worked in all weather , and my physical agility was definitely put to the test. I would recommend delta to anyone who is looking for a stable career with benefits."
good,I loved my job at Delta for the most part.  My issues was the lack of benefits such as insurance and full-time employment. All and all I wouldn't mind going back if I seen improvement within the company.
good,"Greeting passengers and receiving friendly responses. Co-workers always willing to lend a helping hand. Everyone seems really nice."
good,Working in the Sky Clubs for Delta Airlines was a positive experience for me. I was around great staff and management who made coming to work very exciting. If you show up everyday ready to work and with a good attitude you'll have a pleasant experience at Delta. The most enjoyable part about work in the Sky Clubs is all the interesting people you get to meet who are traveling.
good,"Great company with great values"
good,just remember that while your working because youll need it. the application process takes a very... very long time. the parking lot is far from the terminal. and be ready for bad weather.
good,"A typical day at work is one that entails meeting people from many different cultures.  What I have learned is to be more of a listener in that, people may speak in different tones, accents and gestures and in order to understand you first have to  listen.  My co-workers are very willing to assist in with problem resolutions and other work related issues.  The hardest part of my job is telling passengers they are not going to make the flight because they have checked in late.  The most enjoyable part of my job is seeking the children faces when they a travelling especially to Disney World."
good,Work in a fast pace enviroment that keeps on changing.  Working with diverse group of people is interesting and fun.  Management team is supportive.
good,"Working in Delta airlines was so much fun , great benefits , great health insurance and work training is awesome . very professional work environment .However the first 5 years of your career you have to be on call for about a week . if you have young children you can't handle both ."
good,"Can be a somewhat of a fun work place depending on your personal outlook of fun. Be warned depending on your station, Your body will be strained. But when you're on a first class flight to the Caribbean for dirt cheap it wouldn't matter much lol."
good,"The work/life balance is amazing and you are really appreciated. However, your direct management plays a VERY big role in your advancement. Some leads and supervisors are not always forthcoming with information and that tends to leave employees in the dark."
good,"*A typical day varies due to weather on a day to day bases. *Learned how to work safely in and around dangerous area when dealing with aircrafts."
good,Hit the ground running. Management were works in progress they are still learning. Some good some bad. Co-workers were generally a good group. Irregular operations. Being outside.
good,"The hardest part of the job is working in all elements of weather, especially summer with the heat of plane engines on top of the sun and lack of shade!!!"
good,The company was very good to their workers. My coworkers were fun hard working people. Advancement was there if you wanted it.
good,"Traveling around the world along with experiencing chapters of a passengers life (whether good times or bad for them) and trying to make a difference in a positive way, even though, it was for a short moment in there life."
good,It was a good job to be at and i also get as many hours as i wanted. I like working outside and being hands on.
good,"Great experience  fun place to work in and great to be able to deal with airplanes on a daily basis , greeted and announced flight details,"
good,"Every day at work is stressful, learned to watch for my self. management not much to talk. love most of my coworkers. hardest part of my job is your whole shift daily doing a job of 3 people at the same time. launch breaks? havent seen one real."
good,It's very exciting and fast paced. Never a dull moment. Meeting People from all over the world as you travel the world for free and getting paid to do it.
good,"Fun job, incompetent managers, great co-workers, dangerous environment,  exciting industry."
good,"Once you enter into the call center, it becomes a bit difficult to transfer to another department very soon. It took many people several years to eventually get off of the phones. Seniority based, so you may be working overnight for a while. Count out weekends also. The management is fine. I enjoyed helping people and the ability to make decisions as a customer service agent. All of my co-workers were fun and the environment and actual work was fun for me."
good,Each day is diffrent depending on operation needs.  I learn something each day which is my favourite part of the job.
good,This workplace is great for travel benefits. Advancement is hard to come by and the pay can be much better. Management is progressing daily.
good,"In the six years total I worked for Delta Airlines, I can say I was treated with a kindness and respect you wouldn't from such a large company. Most work days consisted of a lot of team work and step by step communication, which was easy to do with when you work with people who love their jobs. Management was very hands on and had open door policies so it was easy to discuss anything that was bothering you wither is was personal or work related. I would have to say that my favorite part of working for Delta was getting to participate in the fundraisers to raise money for the community."
good,Good Job to have. management could be much better. Great benefits including flights to travel.
good,"A typical day is busy and hectic, especially if there is a bad weather day.  It was exciting, crazy, productive, and fulfilling.  It was good to be able to expedite Delta products as efficiently as possible."
good,Delta is a well-run company with an appreciation of its employees.
good,"I worked there for 29 years, so I must have loved it.  Good people, good benefits.  After 9-11, things went south.  Company started losing money and went bankrupt.  Many pay cuts and job cuts.  It wasn't the same anyone.  Sad.  Hopefully, things are better there now.  I retired from there, but I still think of it as MY company  :-)"
good,"It shouldn't take anyone by surprise, that hatred or negativity spreads equally as fast, if not faster, than a positive outlook-Which is why I like to approach any job, or career, with optimism. I'm very straight forward, and like to see that jobs get done, and done well. Although I have been teased as being ""excessive-compulsive"", i also bring smiles and laughter to the work place. There is a time and place for everything, even at work; However, when it comes down to crunch time, I'm focused on organized closure, and I include my fellow employees in a team-like manner. I don't do work-place-clicks, facades, or half-effort work, and call me naive, but I have the predetermined prospect that my fellow employees will view their work ethic and character in the same light."
good,young station. lots of different personalities and you will learn a lot about aircraft.
good,"Great place to work. Expect new hires to be used and abused, very high seniority company with old timer mentality. earn respect and you have a great career."
good,Wonderful company to work for. Everyday is totally different even if you are working in the same position. You get to work with people one on one and make a difference.
good,"I  met my all-time movie-star Sidney Poitier, shook his hand and got his autograph. I learned that pressure brought out the best in me. I was able to remain calm and take control"
good,"A typical day at Northwest airlines would include me dealing with customers from all over the world. A lot of my work included translating for my coworkers and for customs. I've learned to respect and communicate with people of diverse ethnic backgrounds. The hardest part of the job was learning to work under stress but that is something I have been able to successfully overcome. I had a respectable relationship with my managers as they frequently promoted positive synergy between all levels of employment. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet so many wonderful people and of course, travelling and being exposed to different ways of life."
good,"E uma empresa boa,não atrasava no salário paga bem e os chefes são bastante educados ."
good,"A place where you can excel if you learn fast and work hard. Pay generally lags for administrative support personnel, but company is known for its open and honest management style.  "
good,"rotas diferentes,publico agradável,fazendo sol ou chuva doente ou não sempre atendi ao publico com imensa satisfação,pois já que iria medir água e ainda dar-lhes uma conta,seria muito injusto mau atende-los.aprendi tanto que são poucas as linhas.Gostaria de ter tido oportunidade de crescer"
good,"Although the business model was the same everyday, everyday was far from the same. I enjoyed the challenges and demands of the business and learned how to value diversity in the work place. The most enjoyable part of the job was bringing happiness to others."
good,My Day started out great with a cup of coffee. I had to have a jump off for what Ihad in store.. Management was bad and everybody was looking at everyone.
good,Good working environment except some supervisors and managers whom abuse position of authority. Ample opportunity for advancement.
good,"Directed 300-person Airport Customer Service Team, oversaw enterprise-wide customer service operations, accommodated 25 daily domestic and international flights, and assured quality customer service to 100,000 daily airline patrons."
good,I was exposed to a great team that loved what they did!
good,Great place to meet new people and expand as far as networking
good,Great place to work for entry level job into your field. Oppurtunities are competitive to get due to high seniority levels.
good,"Although this is not a 9-5 M-F environment it allows you to set your own schedule, learned to respect and understand various religions & cultures, seeing the world in a different view other than that portrayed on television"
good,Training new hires to follow FAA and DOT protocol
good,My 13 years with Delta provided me with a sound basis in the ground operations of an international carrier.
good,many carrer oportunities great benefits learned many airport positions and enjoyed working with planes
good,Working in the airline business for 27 years was challenging and rewarding at the same time. No two days were ever the same. People skills are of the utmost importance as well as excellent customer service skills.
good,i love working with people great team work love helping others..
good,"If you like the on again off again fast paced type of work, then this is the right industry to be in."
good,"Very Customer Service Driven atmosphere...very good place to work, apply yourself and get advancement to move and grow in another area when applicable."
good,"This was a demanding place to work. While there are many perks for working here, management could do with alot of improvement as it was the weakest part of the experience"
good,She moved to a different area and I couldn't get there on the days she wanted  but she moved again and I am still there with Delta she is a wonderful old lady
good,Employees are helpful and knowledgeable to contractors and it is a place to grown and continue learning. The advancement through the company is positive and once you get on to Delta family full-time you can enjoy other benefits like flying and joining the 401K program.
good,I only really decided to work at Delta Air Lines for the flight benefits which are very much worth the job. The pay isn’t the best and the shift set up is a bit wonky because it’s very limited but they need you so the balance isn’t there unless your full-time which is hard to get. The management is staffed pretty well as far as I experienced. Helpful and flexible. The work is pretty heavy duty but you get used to it fast. So in total I would say it’s all worth it if you want to travel the world for free or super discounted
good,"The work environment is not good."
good,It was a friendly work environment.  The only downside I really felt to working there was that there was no formal training of newer technologies coming to market.
good,"not much hourly pay but flight benefits are good and equal out the hard work/ outside in cold, wet and dry climate must be prepared to work as a team to get the job done"
good,Can be stressful but very competitive. Needs to raise the wages to make up for the loss of benefits for employees. Bring back full benefits for DGS employees and Management.
good,The job was exciting and engaging. The work was difficult but fulfilling. The flight benefits were exceptional and there was definitely room to grow within the company.
good,Delta airlines was a great best to workThe weather was very difficult to work at times. rain sleet or snow outside it was pretty tough to work. Anyone need a work out on the way up ahead to be safe and I will take caution for the planes velocity. When I started on the ramp you were required to lease to 15 planes.
good,"Great company to work at. Great energy and supervisors."
good,"great company to work for ,supportive peers & management ,fun, lots of great incentives and bonuses,wonderful benefits as well, training somewhat stressful"
good,the days went fast paced because LAX airport was a busy airport. So it was an adrenaline rush every day rushing from one gate to the next to process the flight.  It was fun if you like that kind of thing. It also was fun to activate the jetbrige up to the airplanes when they pull up to the gate. I enjoyed the job but the pay was not competitive at the time
good,"Great place to work. Work life balance is a challenge. "
good,"Good company with focus on customer and employee.  Also drive to deliver the best product and service to the consumer.  Great to employee as well. Overall, good company"
good,I enjoyed working for Delta it was a great work place.Good hours and i learn a lot it was fast pace most days however I was able to keep up. Lots of overtime if you wanted.
good,I enjoyed working at Delta Air Lines.  The job was very dynamic and satisfactory.  The opportunity to learn the industry and hone new professional skills was very good.  The senior leadership was top-notch.  The downside was the stability of the work environment.  Many lay-offs due to constant business priority changes at the middle-management level.  The solution always seemed to be to change out the workforce.
good,A fun place to work.. When you combine it with the benefits that you get it is tough to beat.  Management can be better but the industry moves so quick they are constantly bringing new management up.
good,"The travel were benefits were awesome and the people are very nice.  Delta offers good pay and a prominent company name. Everyone knows Delta. On than more than one occasion while traveling, domestic or international, when you tell someone you're from Atlanta they ask if you work for Delta and a lot of times the  person you're talking to also works for Delta."
good,"I loved the airline industry; however after 20 years, was forced into early retirement due to the merger between Northwest and Delta.  A lot of people lost their jobs, sadly.  However, if I could work for them again, I would--except not my original city due to job changes."
good,A typical day at work involved loading and unloading airplanes with cargo.  Also directing planes in and out of gates within designated time frames.  Management was pretty good overall.  I got to work with all kinds of people.  The hardest part of the job was working in extreme temperatures.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,"Delta offers a competitive salary and an unique experience. I would recommend working here. However, you do have to work holidays and time off is limited."
good,"Had a lot of fun, and some intense times, identifying ways for Delta and Northwest to learn from each other, find innovative solutions and deliver savings and operational excellence for passengers."
good,It used to be more flexible than it is now. They seem to have been understaffed in the flight attendant work group for several years now. This makes it impossible to get a day off for a life event if you are junior. (You remain junior for about 20 years. Senior flight attendants are from 35-50+ years of service.) It is understood that you will work weekends and holidays while junior. Summer is the high season of travel and you will travel 18-21 days a month from May to August. If the staffing improves the quality of life will improve dramatically. When we were well staffed flight attendants could work a very flexible schedule and easily drop trips or move trips to different days to accommodate personal life events.
good,Every day was different. It was a way to meet people from all cultures. Loved working with different people everyday. The hardest part was working cancellations and try to accommodate everyone.
good,"have to go through training"
good,Delta Airlines offers the opportunity for travel and new experiences. The training [and ongoing education] is second to none. The new Flight Attendants will enjoy many 'great trips' - awesome experience
good,"Most locations start you off as a part-time employee (so no medical benefits) and you'll have to wait before you can apply for an open full-time bid. It takes about 3 years or so to become full time and you have a cap of somewhere around 1500 hours you can work within a year. But during that time you have full flight benefits. "
good,When you first come in you clock in electronically wait about 5-10 before the debriefing of your night. 
good,Very fast pace work area. Extra busy during holiday and winter months .Working  with many wonderful people. also flight benefits were great. Able to travel and see parts of the world I would not have had the opportunity to see with other employment.
good,the hardest part of the job  is the customers. management could be more consistent. However the ability to fly anywhere the company flies for little to no money with your family is one of the best incentives. you may start as a ready reserve but the company is always growing and full time is possible.
good,Reservations best place to learn about the company.  Friendly environment for employee to grow and able to make lateral department switch. Management needs work however. Too many missed opportunities to promote within.
good,Great environment with good pay for the type of work. Wish I couldve stayed. If you cant stand being outside in really hot or cold weather this isnt  the spot for you
good,Each day is different due to the many variables that affect the operation. Your full attention and promptness is always demanded.
good,"I worked for DAL a total of approximately 32 years, two of those as a contractor after taking an early retirement package.  For a long time, Delta had a family feel to it.  That is long gone now."
good,"Great working environment.  Just like at every job, delta has its pros and cons. Overall, its a good working environment. Contractors benefits are nothing to brag about, but at least flying is free."
good,"The workplace is great I love the people everyone seems to get along well. A typical day would be working coordinating flights and making sure everything makes on time and at the right gate. Management can be friendly but they seem to always leave us hanging in that they give us promises they usually don't keep. The hardest part is there seems to be a lack of effort from many newer employees and the ones that have been around, feel underpaid for the stress and physical work the workplace brings. However given the things I've learned I'm now able to drive freight trucks, as well as operate parts of commercial aircrafts that operates solely on baggage and cargo. In short its a great place but they ask so much from us and we are way understaff and respectfully underpaid."
good,"Learned a lot about workplace culture, management, leading and being pro-active. Learned about many processes and standard ethics and processes to be followed at work place."
good,"Working on the ramp is a very physically intensive job and you will go home sore some days but for the work, you are definitely compensated well with annual bonuses and flight benefits allowing you to visit pretty much anywhere in the world."
good,I have met sooooo many people from all different walks of life and it was very fun to work for Delta Air Lines. Terminal 4 @ JFK is amazing energy. Hartsfield Jackson International Airport in ATL is MAGICAL and is Delta's Headquarters.

good,I wasn't employed by Delta Airlines. I was a student trainee but I learned a lot about customer service and how the system goes around airline airport operations.
good,"Good company, even better people. Manager was a great person and was easy to talk to. It is very hard work, especially in the summer when things heat up."

good,"The people who work here are incredibly intelligent, humble, and have great senses of humor! I laugh until I cry on almost a daily basis and learn so much from the people around me."
good,I truly enjoyed my career at this employer.  There were some troubling times during changes in economic conditions as well as senior leadership.  This put strains on the staff and led to some very high quality people leaving the organization.
good,My only problems with Delta would be that the times scheduled to work would change and go based on seniority and it got difficult to work around while in school.
good,Delta airlines is a great company who has   provided excellent service to its employees. Delta provided a excellent work schedule that helped graduate college and still maintain employment with the company.
good,"Every work day leaves you feeling good, but that day can be long. Getting sick while away from home can really be uncomfortable. Every job has it's stresses, this job the benefits out way the stresses."
good,Prior to bankruptcy the company was a great family oriented company that valued it's employees. I left just prior to the bankruptcy and have heard that the company has turned around.
good,A great place to start a career. The leadership/Leads go out of there way to make sure you have what you need to perform your job. The opportunity to advance is endlist.
good,Delta was a wonderful company to work for. Friendly staff great benefits and pay. Each day came into work called students in regards into enrolling in school. Learned alot about the CDL license.

good,Must be a very detailed oriented person to excel at the job and be able to adjust to a fast paced work environment. Many opportunities to learn about the industry and the inner workings.
good,"Typical day at work is 10hrs or more with at least 1 day off a week. I learned to expand my patience; The most enjoyable part of the job is delivering an aircraft ahead of schedule. I enjoy a sense of accomplishment knowing I contributed to an airworthy aircraft return to service. Hardest part of the job is working with inexperienced mechanic that cannot assess or see hazards at work. Which may endanger themselves, coworkers, or aircraft."
good,"Working for Delta Group was a great learning experience. it was my first time in the Gulf, and it helped me grew my personality and vision. The company and co workers helped me a lot, in adapting to a new way of life and in facing the challenges of working in such a large group. I really enjoyed the exposure I got when dealing with VIP guests and businessman and I learned great deal about business management and relationship building."
good,"This company has a great balance for work and personal life. The company has great benefits but there are work politics that can prevent growth from within the company. Some are laid off due to organization realignment. While others are forced into retirement. Needless to say, overall Delta Airlines is a great company to work for with great benefits."
good,"Cabin crew is a very challenging but rewarding job. It takes you all over the world, allows you to work with multicultural crews and you meet some very interesting people. The layovers can be exciting also very short. "
good,"Pleasant atmosphere but harder work. It was challenging but I gained a lot of experience in different management."
good,"Maintained a large fleet of commercial aircraft in heavy maintenance as well as line maintenance. Interacted with management, back shops and engineering."
good,"Overall, Delta is a good company to work for.  The schedule is really nice, and the flight benefits are great!  Being a baggage agent is really rough though, and it's easy to hurt yourself stacking bags.  It can also be really difficult since you have to be out in all kinds of weather. Also, there are a few ALA's who are irresponsible and just downright stupid, and have absolutely no business being in charge of another human being, much less the safety of an airplane and its passengers."
good,"Very friendly coworkers, everybody there wants you to have a safe but good time working.  Management could be a lot better but it takes time to change something from bad to good."

good,Delta is a family environment and allows you to meet new people from all walks of life. I enjoy serving customers and tasking in order to make sure flights depart on time.
good,I have been working at Delta for 2 1/2 years and the perks are great with flights. Fun people to work with and for. I have learned the safety procedures of each flight. Management is very understanding and solve problems proffesionaly. The hardest part of the job is knowing i will not get FT in Boston. The greatest part of my job is knowing i fly for free in the USA
good,A little disorganized with the rules but I had fun working here for the many years that I did and would think about going back. The travel benefits were definitely nice.
good,"I worked at Delta in GSE as a co-op for three semesters. I was given tons of freedom in the office, and, as such was free to do as much or little work as I liked. Often I wished however that the co-op program in the specific department was more organized as I would have to really hound the engineers for work. If you're not incredibly self-motivated, you can come out of this job with little to show for it."
good,supervised other employees. learned alot about planes. my bosses were cool. everybody i worked with were the best. down time we walked the airport or played ping pong in the break room
good,I enjoyed meeting famous people while doing my job. It was not as difficult as I assume it was going to be but it was rewarding in the end. I would love to become a manager within any airport loading operations.
good,I enjoyed my time workng in Air Cargo ' and being in a fast-pace enviroment. I was able to utilize my skills and gain more as well. I hope to return to the same field and progress from there. Thank you!
good,very good job to work with more people more jobs to do and work with and for a lot happen good people good company good money good times goog days
good,I think the management needed more training and there were way too many cliques that took place in the Minneapolis office. Other than that the benefits were nice for the flights but the pay and compensation was extremely low. I feel for the work required and the amount of money I was bringing into the company as well as other employees a mere 11 dollars an hour was just not cutting it. The benefits were nice yes but you need money in order to survive and this job does not have that.
good,"Monitor the over-all vendor maintenance processes with emphasis on safety, quality, reliability, and budget to meet departure schedules."
good,"My first JFK job was full of firsts. I became very comfortable driving around planes which was something that was intimidating at first.  I also learned how to drive a forklift. And this was my first time driving big vehicles with air brakes."
good,"A typical day at Delta starts bright and early around 630am"
good,"A typical day can be crazy, flights delayed, cancelled, rerouted etc. Dealing with hundreds of angry and frustrated passengers really makes a person have to use multiple skills: deescalating situations, problem solving, and computer programing all consistently with time managing skills. In this job I learned, computer programing, research skills, FAA regulations, pay roll, scheduling, and various other office skills. At Delta, you learn something new every day. I had wonderful management, very kind, understanding, and professional. My co-workers were probably the hardest part of the job, very dramatic and have a difficult time working as a team. Sometimes working with these people was almost comparable to working on an episode of a soap opera. However, despite this, the best part of this job other than the consistent intellectual challenges is the ability to travel. I have traveled the world! Domestic travel can be a headache, but international travel makes it worth it!!!"
good,"My work day began early which I loved, all day long I was helping people get their luggage checked in, helped them to get to their gate.  Always around people from all over the world and so rewarding to help the elderly, I always treated people the way I would like to be treated.  And especially the elderly I would treat them if they were my own mom or dad."
good,"I must say Delta always treated me kind. High standards, great safety record, and SNACKS on the flights. I gained a wealth of knowledge at this company. Great incentives for employees and I think they found a reason just to put a pot luck together. Great great great!"
good,sign in find out my team i'm going to be working with and what area that i will be working at wait for my first plane head out meet the plane wak the plane in to its proper gate and park the plane onc plane is parked start to unload bags and proceed to on load bags once off load is done after loading is done connect push back tug to plane and proceed to walk the plane out
good,"A typical day is collaborating with teams in ATL and other teams on the system to design leadership strategy training for upcoming conferences or learning gaps in the field.  I enjoy the creative element of being able to assist with design, work with the field teams and then being able to delivery the material to leadership."
good,"All and All the Company was fun!  It sometimes was a very fast paced job to load baggage on to cart, take off baggage from plane and then finally loaded the baggage on to the airplane.  Drove luggage that came off plane inside and unloaded to passengers.  It made for a hard work out plus stay in shape."
good,"A busy day checking passengers in, giving boarding passes, checking baggage to proper destination. Boarding passengers, dispatch aircraft.  Meet arriving flights."

good,"I enjoyed the years that I worked at Northwest Airlines, Inc. It was the right balance between work and life. My fellow co-workers were amazing people that I miss being around."
good,Meet and interacting with different people. I learned how to be productive and to become a great team player during busy days. Management rules and regulations is consistent but has changed over time. My fellow employees are easy to work with and practices professionalism at all times. The hardest part of the job is to give satisfaction for inconvenience passengers if our options run out. The most enjoyable part of the job is the experience and following job duties overall.
good,Being able to travel over the world for little or minimal cost is the best perk ever. I miss that more than anything.
good,Load and un-load baggage to and from aircraft. workers where fun to be around. down time was great and could work alot of hours.
good,"very busy lots of standing, management fair, great coworker, hardest part of job lifting bags, most rearding meeting people"

good,I started working with Delta in October 2011. My experience here has gone very well. I have a totally new and different respect for the jobs that are done in order to make this company a success.
good,"Although Delta is the largest airline in the world, the feeling of being part of a family existed. Headquartered in Atlanta, Delta employs more than 80,000 employees and operates a fleet of more than 700 aircraft. Delta services over 350 destinations in 65 countries. I enjoyed working with Delta; learning new cultures and traveling the world."
good,"Interview process is very ""strict"",  and you must be polished/ business professional."
good,Typical day was to sign in to what gate your name was assigned to and your Ala and gate crew. Check arrival and departure time and size of the plane. It is a great physical place to work.
good,Great place to work with friendly work environment and collaborative. True feeling of team work as well as belonging when solving for complex issues on a daily basis.
good,"great perks and benefits, a professional and friendly environment, and flexibility."
good,"Sustainable place to work, Seniority is a big thing here, however there is a lot of people that just do not care and because of this it hurts my ability to work here"
good,"A usual day is adrenalin filled especially working on the ramp. Eyes are always on us so it's kind of like doing your job while on a stage. From the time that aircraft begins to enter your gate to the disconnection of the tug from the aircraft and that last salute you give to the pilots right before the aircraft taxis and then takes off to its destination. A feeling of pride and dignity, it's the best."
good,"No job is perfect but overall I loved working for Delta!  I miss it, and it is very hard to get a job as a Flight Attendant for them.  I am very happy to have had the opportunity to have worked for them!"
good,It is a great environment where we get to relax and I am able to work on work peacefully. I have to take charge a lot of the time and do my supervisors job and tell other employees what to do. I do this to help out because I have been there for three years and some of the supervisors are new.
good,"*A typical day will keep you busy thru-ought the shift."
good,"Good experience,good advancement opportunities,loyal, to employee would definitely refer someone else. Left because of physical needs,commute too hard"

good,love it it was great. very good to work at it . this was a good time. really fun and loved it very much. whish i was still there. Free place to fly and live in the sun. Very good.
good,"Mid level management had a tendency to struggle with change. ""This is how we've always done it."" Seemed to be a pretty common attitude. Clean building. Easy parking that was free."
good,Great company benefits. Quick hiring process. Knowledgeable recruiters several assignments became availAble. I only worked at the Georgia World Congress center as a convention agent. Just a one week assignment
good,I really enjoyed my time working for Delta. I had to find other work with medical benefits because of my daughter being very sick and we needed the them really badly. Delta is a great place to work at you learn so much and meet so many different people.
good,Delta is an excellent place to work. They believe in their employee. They empower and listen to employees input. They put safety first.  They believe in their  product.
good,"it was okay, i really enjoyed it and the traveling."
good,"Delta's culture fosters safety.  In daily briefings, safety procedures are addressed as it pertains to daily tasks.  Also, frequent learning management courses are mandatory to keep in compliance with governing bodies such as the FAA."

good,the company really invested in consumer retention through innovation to ensure our customers always preferred our services. The work place culture was very homely and we felt like ohana.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was conversing with people from different parts of the world! And also being able to fly to different places with no charge!
good,"Delta is a great company. The greatest opportunity for advancement is in Atlanta. I enjoy the flight benefits and the 9% 401K contributions, 3% just for being an employee with an additional 6% match."
good,Good company to work for. Killeen airport had bad management though. They made it hard for me to work while pregnant. Even with a doctors note saying I didn’t need to lift 100 lb bags
good,"Good place to work, relaxed work environment, nice location with excellent parking spaces and carpooling available.  Nice cafeteria available with outdoor break area."
good,"Delta Airlines has part-time positions but, you can work no more than 1500 hours a year so the typical work shift is five hours. Great for college students and if you have a full-time job and need a little bit extra. This position has no health benefits but, traveling in the U.S is free and traveling overseas is a lot cheaper than the original price."
good,The environment is really fast based and the communication is lacking in some areas. I have not received any training just told to start the job on day one.
good,"Great place to work for, Delta gives you the opportunity to learn and expand your knowledge in the field of automotive and diesel. They also provide great training programs and the benefits are great."
good,"great company to work for and benefits to have, learn a lot of information and customer service skills, its def a team skill setting and overall a great company."
good,Travel was a daily part of the job as a flight attendant. I enjoyed working there and they had great benefits.  Free parking and easy to access from most of the metro.
good,"Many resources available for employee assistance. Quick response to work issues. The company takes pride in their employees, the Delta brand and the culture."
good,Good place to work with good work/life balance. Takes a few years to top out but once you are there the pay is good. Somewhat of a variety of career types.
good,"Good company challenging work."
good,There is never a same day. Always learning something new and room to advance within the company. Take advantage of the many lessons that are available and veterans that have insight to make your job easier and safe.
good,Delta is a face paced environment and was mentally demanding.  The pay and benefits were good until the company filed bankruptcy.  Management was better in the early days of the company.
good,Everyday is different..  It's all dependent on the load factors and on-time performances.  The benefits are excellent and the company treats its employees well.
good,Change was always constant.  There was always something new to learn.  I worked well with others but was able to work with little supervision.  The hardest part of the job was making the decision to retire.
good,"I worked at Delta while in college in Salt lake City, Utah, they were a great company to work for. My job was based on a part time level so I could finish school."
good,fun work environment where everyone gets along well with one another. management gets along well with everyone as well. the hardest part of the job is working in different weather conditions.
good,A very rewarding company to work for. At Delta Cargo the atmosphere was laid back but productive. During my tenure there I learned about timely departures and arrivals along with the importance of documentation and regulations.
good,"Good place to work, fast paced and rotational work program. Scads of OT...MORE than straight time.  Usual schedule 4 weeks on 2 weeks off. Only drawback...no per diem."
good,Delta Airlines was a good company to work for. During my time there I learned a great deal about the airline industry and the vital role that customer service plays in their day to day operations.
good,"I only worked at a station, so we had a little more down time compared to other airports. The way our flights were timed out we would work for about an hour to an hour and a half outside then work on tasks in the office for about an hour to wait for the next flight to come in. It was a interesting combination of outdoor physical labor and indoor office work."
good,"Can't really comment too much other than I was glad to not have to be part of the demise of airlines during the great merger years, as so many lost their jobs outright through no fault of their own.  Only the casualty of the contraction of number of large airlines competeing for the same customer base!"
good,"fast paced"
good,Being on time is the most important thing working at delta.  I enjoyed working around and with aircraft.  There is a diverse culture where you can meet great people.  Its a very physical job which can be demanding.
good,"I enjoy working at Delta.  It can be just like many other companies in many ways, but I think you get out of it what you put into it.  The company's charitable giving is what I am most impressed with."
good,"Delta is known for its legendary, reliable service to its customers, our number one focus is the safety of our passengers while enhancing every aspect of their travel experience.

At Delta, our brand is critical to our continued success."
good,"It varied daily,I learned how to be flexible and work with many as a team.Management sometimes varied some good and some not so good.It was a great workplace.Trying to perform the job with always constantly changing perimeters and increasing the Stats for reservation ticket sales.I didn't like the on the phone name calling to me of the customers for not being able to always get what they wanted ex:lowest fare,aisle seat, window seat, leave earlier,leave later and etc.)"
good,"We had fun, traveled a lot but worked a lot as well, downside is that I missed many family reunions, many holidays, birthdays, once you have babies your world changes and I had to relocate to WAS anyways."
good,Great place to work.  The management and people are always friendly and willing to help.  The hours typical for any aviation MRO.  I would recommend working there.
good,"I will recommend this job to anyone just out of high school or college. Great way to meet people from around the world. "
good,delta was a great environment to work in. so much room for growth within the company and everyday felt like it was a new adventure. I would recommend this job to any and everyone
good,Delta is a great company to work for has very flexible hours you can trade hours to get extra time off. There's always postings for advancements. Benefits are nice for full time.
good,Working in customer service can be challenging at times.  I loved the travel benefits.  Pay is low starting out. Shift bid can be a challenge starting out.  Seniority is important to get the better shifts.
good,"enjoyed working with all the employees and supervision. I worked as a Ground Maintenance Mechanic repairing Ground System equipment, passenger loading bridges, conveyor belts and passenger bag turntables"
good,"Best airline to work for, they create a culture of longevity because everyone becomes family. Mostly because the factors of working there are all based on family."
good,"a good place to work, they taught me the meaning of teamwork, and what i learned there would last me a life time. the most enjoyable part of the job was the people, i made lots of friends there."
good,"Great culture"

good,Delta was a wonderful company to work for. Management was very helpful when transitioning into my role. Guidance was always given when asked for. Workplace culture was good.
good,Delta was a good place to work. I enjoyed working with many different people and the company offered many opportunities to grow and learn in my job performance. It was a very rewarding job. You could see immediate results in a job well done.
good,great flight benefits.  most managers/supervisors are easy to talk to.  schedules are very flexible.  the company gives a lot of employee incentives.  nice uniforms
good,Great place to work.  Confirmed by many awards from business community.  Really walks the walk when it says it takes care of its employees (except when outsourced).
good,"Great company to work for, room for advancement, great pay and profit sharing ."
good,"The experience working for Delta was awesome. The atmosphere, the work environment, the people, they made going to work everyday great. Travel benefits, as well as retirement options, were well above industry standards. Sorry to have had to leave."
good,I really had fun while having my internship because i learned a lot of things especially about the airline industry as well as the cargo and logistics
good,"Great workplace location.  Friendly co workers.  There were no ""hardest"" parts of the job because the challenge to resolve the problems was satisfying."
good,Overall I have had a very positive experience working for delta air lines. The only thing is the ready reserve program does not allow insurance. That needs to change.
good,The airline industry is not what it once used to be.  Job security is only moments away from outsourcing to another company at the rate of minimum wage that they trust to work around multi-million dollar aircraft and equipment.  Once upon a time there was not even such a thing as a part-time employee.  All of that changed.  Unions did not protect our jobs in 69 cities that got outsourced and there was no guarantee that it would not happen again to a city that you might relocate in order to keep your job.  This is why I left the industry at the time.  Delta seems to be very stable now even though they were still under bankruptcy protection yet allowed to by NWA which was already out of bankruptcy at the time.  How the Justice Department allowed that to happen is beyond belief.
good,"Delta provides good care for their employees, and provides a great space of equality and collaborative individuals.  There are earned paid days off, as well as free flight benefits."
good,"When the economy was booming it was an amazing place to work. It had great people, benefits, perks and advancement opportunities. The pay was pretty good and the job itself was fun. It wasn't like working for a living."
good,I loved this job as a Flight Attendant! because it allowed me to be in control of the flight as I was an Onboard Leader. I have a leadership quality about me and I was able to work within my natural ability. We went to some very wonderful places all over the world and meet some very interesting people.
good,"Aid and CPR.  We worked together as a team, with pilots, in any emergency situation to determine what the best course of action would be for the immediate safety of our passengers.  I attended an intense 6 week training program that prepared us for any situation that would occur before, during, or after flight.  During our training we were taught what it means to provide legendary guest service and I have incorporated that philosophy into my everyday life."
good,Always had plenty to do with monthly services. Was able to see how Pilots and Flight Attendants tr Met new people.ained. learned how to work on new and exciting applications.
good,"I want to get back on with the company. The benefits were a great plus from health, dental, 401(k), and the flight benefits. Plenty of room to grow, and plenty of training available."
good,"ticket counter, gate agent and baggage service"
good,"A job that requires a lot of effort but will give you recover time, requires a lot of teamwork but you still need to be responsible to yourself. Good benefits and solid pay."
good,"Ensured safety of Delta Airlines properties, staff and clients; monitored/ patrolled airport grounds, secured surrounding area and worked with coworkers to accomplish certain tasks."
good,el ambiente es bueno pero le remuneración no compensa con lo laborado
good,Overall it is a good place to work I loved my job and the students. I just couldn’t get use to the lack of pay and only getting paid once a month was hard
good,"Delta as an overall company strongest strength is their integrity and trust to makes it a priority to keep the happiness  and wel being of their employees first. "
good,"It takes too many years to be able to move up because EVERYTHING at Delta Airlines is Seniority based. From flying to advancement, to new job placement. Being later in my career, I wanted more advancement for my abilities, and I knew it would not be offered to me because of the seniority aspect of Delta. Top out pay was not long, although I personally feel it only takes a person 5 years or so to learn all the main aspects of a position, so why does it take longer to get the top pay? Most airlines are like that, not just Delta."

Working at the counter or even sales on the phone makes everyday a challenge.

good,"All in all, Delta was VERY VERY good to me.  It's an awesome place to work with excellent resources and people.  Like any company, sometimes the decision makers in place are not right, but the company is large enough to navigate through that with some persistence.  Work life can be easily managed,a nd the environment, although fast paced, is family driven and excellent especially for new grads, as you will learn a ton.  One piece of advice is define your career path early, and align yourself with those that can help you to achieve goals and push you.  Otherwise, you could end up in a black hole that's impossible to get out of.  Otherwise, this place is excellent."
good,"Delta was an excellent place to start working. Benefits such as the ability to fly standby was delightful. Because of the large size, it was relatively easy to transition horizontally. Not so much vertically. The corporate culture was strong and powerful due to 80k plus employees. It was easy to feel lost in the crowd or like another cog in the machine."
good,"Delta IT is an amazing department to work in.  Teams are self organized; there is not micromanaging.  "
good,"Fun, fast and exciting. always a new adventure. passengers were a challenge but it was interesting. hardest part of the job was traveling to different time zones and being away from home"

good,I  would start my job by straightening up the gate that I was assigned to to get it ready for an incoming aircraft. Verify the luggage brought to the gate to make sure it was at the correct location. When the plane arrived our crew would offload the plane and then reload with the baggage for the next flight. when loaded and time to leave I would push out the plane to the tarmac and then return to the gate to get ready for the next plane. Management worked with us to in sure correct weight and turn around time was achieved.
good,A great place to work.  Multiple shifts to choose from.  The workplace culture is great.  The hardest part of the job is working outside in the elements.

But would definitely recommend to anyone that willing to show up on time and work."
good,Major benefit  was being able to travel for free on your available free time. Travel anywhere in the country or overseas. Overseas would only cost taxes only.
good,"Got along with the child, i was able to keep the child entertained and meet his needs. I had to cook for the child and put him to sleep."
good,"work was pretty good most of my time there until 9/11 happen and I was one of the 9000 ppl took the pay out bcos of early  retirement age 53  in the year of 2006,workers were good and bad,but things work out,management was ok, hardest part was dealing with chemicals and media blast smells but the use of ppe helps a lot,best part was going home at the end of the day for rest and sleep,learned a lot of thing there."
good,"Delta is such a wonderful airline to work for.  I often regret having left.  However, the customer calls in the baggage dept were getting too vile and violent for me.  I found it too depressing to stay."
good,Great place to work. Lot of options to grow and learn. great benefits and package. Lot of company outings and bonding events.
good,"A great company to work for if you want to travel and have the money to do it. Great company culture that works very well together. However, not much room for horizontal advancement. Departments are rigidly different and there is minimal communication. Would recommend for someone who's looking for a stable career and likes the airline industry."
good,"checking in passengers tagged luggage's print out boarding pass"
good,"Call centre atmosphere was strict and draining at times, but was good experience for the work place.  Not much room for advancement as it is an American based company and all corporate jobs are in the U.S."
good,The company is great to work for even though the environment may not be the best. A great company with great benefits and a good place (if more appropriate) to evolve in.
good,"I'll keep it short. Delta Airlines is a very good company with much more pros than cons. Its time sensitive, some pressure, heavy baggage, and dealing with angry frustrated customers on a daily basis? NO this work isn't easy by a long shot but as with everything else in life, its whatever you make it. Plus the bennies make up for it and Richard Anderson is an awesome ceo!"
good,"A Northwest foi uma empresa aerea excepcional, digo foi porque infelizmente foi vendida em 2005 e passou a ser parte da Delta formando um das maiores aerolinhas do planeta."
good,"un buen ambiente laboral con excelentes compañeros de trabajo"
good,Delta Airlines is a ok company. Management can be a bit iffy at times with some managers not being ready for the roles they are placed in. Working conditions vary from extremely hot in the summer to extremely cold and wet in the winters. Flight benefits for you and your family are excellent though.
good,"I became a Flight Attendant after graduating from College. My vast travels as a child helped me with this decision. My family insisted each year that we experience a variety of destinations for our family vacations. My mother a Flight Attendant of past years, looked at this as an education all in its own."

good,"For four years, I was a Ramp Agent at Delta Airlines and my job was to load the passenger's luggage onto and from the aircraft. A group of three workers, including myself, were responsible for approximately 200 bags per flight, each with varying weights, of course. So, lifting the heaviest bags along with a completely full flight required the most strength and team work, difficult in some cases. Working in inclement weather was never pleasing either, but I did enjoy my time at Delta. My supervisors were very fair and hard working. I became close to my colleagues, in fact, I am still well acquainted with them. We all enjoyed the perk of flying across the world at no cost above all, and during slower air traffic days, we had fun playing ping pong and card games in between flights. I took a liking to learning about the different types of machinery that we used to assist us in our tasks. Overall, this was a great company to work for and I am glad I was a dedicated employee at the world's busiest airport!"
good,"I have learned a lot by being assigned to different countries - gained a lot of experience, little time of extra activities."
good,"Managing the high call volume is a typical day for me as a Supervisor. Your able to learn something new everyday. Having a pleasant attitude can get you though some tough calls. A challenge is being able to help with someone through a bereavement who has lost family member and making their travel plans come together is and understatement, but knowing that you help them through a difficult time. That would be the hardest part of my job."
good,"I have worked for Delta Air Lines for 5 years and do not regret a day of it. The supervisors and managers are very caring and considerate to each individual's situation. Once you become part of the organization, you become part of a family. I miss them very much."
good,"The work culture was pretty decent. A typical work was working on 3-4 planes, loading and unloading baggage. Working in all circumstances was required. Safety was there top priority."
good,Allows a lot of growth and movement throughout the company. Great company to work for with the benefits offered and experiences gained. Positive working environment and everyone is trained equally.
good,Excellent Pay and Benefits. They don't have a union and that's a turned off for a Major Airline Carrier. You have to relocate for the most part of being a flight attendant for Delta Airlines.
good,Great place to work I would recommend I enjoyed my time there. People say it’s hard to get hired but I didn’t have any issues at all. The interview process was simple just ma sure you do research before to go.
good,"Great opportunity, benefits are excellent and employee engagement is real. The sky is the limit as long as you are able to relocate. They emphasize promoting employees from within which is good."
good,Love the flight benefits and other benefits but they hardly hire full time employees. Saves them more money to not have to provide medical/dental etc which is a shame
good,"Delta take care of it's employee and is a fun place to work. The work was fast pace and hard, The pay was fair but the flight benefits were great. Now that I'm back in Georgia, I will try to go back."
good,While the work was rigorous the pay was worth it . In addition to receiving 1 free ticket a year to fly anywhere in the world definitely made me want to stay on as long as possible.
good,"Supervise staff and provides training for the job, ensure a safe working environment pay well and benefits with strong leadership. Team work process and strictly follow work environment."
good,"Personally during my time I've had a positive experience. Work has never been too stressful, and the culture as always been easy going. The benefits have allowed me to travel the world and meet a lot of new people as well. "
good,Productive and Fun Workplace.  its a great place to work. only downfall is that you have to start as part time and after a couple of years there is a possibility of an upgrade to a fulltime position.
good,"Great company, very employee oriented. Good pay, good benefits interesting work, flight benefits are great. Upper management was very knowledgeable and personable."
good,"Delta is a fun place to work, with great people at all levels of management. The management cares about employees and helps in managing work and life."
good,I enjoyed working with the crews and employees I had the honor of working with. The employees made my day at work a much better time and more enjoyable to be around!
good,"Typical Day at work is Team meeting before each shift,supervisors give out the flight loads for every Employee throughout the day. SAFETY! #1 thing you need to know/learn while working here. You learn how to use different machines & New Technology. Hardest part is consistent lifting, Gate changes & Weather Delays.Otherwise, its just another beautiful day loading/offloading luggage,Freight,Animals & Etc. You will enjoy working for one of the Best Airlines in the Industry, with the freshest Uniforms in the Industry today, All provided for new employees/Current employees. Management is cool( they have their days) Workplace culture is good.You meet people from all over the world."
good,"Delta is a great place to work, the one thing i like the most were the employee's. We all work together well, and had a great relationship, good or bad, at the end of the date we were still good."
good,"Delta cares a lot about their employees and make sure our morale is up at all time.  We get great incentives, such as free flight benefits, monthly rewards and awesome profit sharing.  Thus, as a Customer Service Representative, you pretty much learn the job as you go. You work in all areas of operation, including issuing tickets and making reservation for passengers, working/boarding flights at the gates, taking claims and setting up deliveries at the baggage service office, and assisting flights at the international migration custom hall. The only problem I can talk about is promotion, which mostly given by seniority instead of educational background or required qualification."
good,Job is very technical and the training programs are great. pay and benefits are assume! great advancement oppertunities. Work and Family balance is great as well.
good,"Good days were GREAT.....bad days, you know you worked.  Management always appreciated the work you did, even when they didn't say it.  The travel benefits were amazing."
good,"This would be the perfect great career opportunity, Alot of Tenure employees, however I am employed as an outside contractor, so my employment time is limited."
good,Loved working for this company while in college. The benefits were great. Flexible schedule allowed me to travel and take school with me. work place culture depends on what station you are working in.
good,Overall this is a good company but the airline business is heavily dependent on the economy so job security is low. The company however is great company to work for.
good,"The job was very challenging due to the variety of people you spoke with every day and the fact that there was always another call waiting to be answered.  The calls were extremely varied and sometimes very stressful, but after your shift was over you were able to walk away from the job and leave it at work. In a typical day we would make reservations, help with seat assignments, discuss aircraft details, reissue tickets, and help resolve any customer problems or direct them to the proper authorities for resolution."
good,Great job lots of good benefits. Lots of Customer Service Training in the U.S.A. Salary was adequate job culture was good!
good,geyrimenkul hedefim  hala  vardır  ama bu 2 b yasası  çıkarsa  daha çok mutlu olcam sektörün gelişmesi için kaliteli  insanların müşteriye hizmt  verebilrmsi  için
good,"didnt like wen Northwest merged with Delta,the hardest part of the job was working in the weather, the best part was partaking in pot luck for lebohnur,field days,,,,,"
good,had worked with different types of approaches for the application development. had seen different types of up and downs and critical times. but learned good experiences
good,"productive in electrical works,smooth relationships between workers and staff,good benefits and unlimited contract"
good,Delta Airlines is an excellent company to work for.  There is room for advancement and opportunities to move around within the company.
good,Delta is a great place to work with great benefits! Friendly and courteous work environment. Great Pay! Flying is a bonus
good,I loved the customer service aspect of this job.  The only reason I left was health related (ears).  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the craziness of the schedules.  Our schedules came out every month the 19th for the following month.  It made it very difficult to plan your life around that.  I am not apposed to a non-traditional schedule as that is what I have been working with the last few years.
good,"As a ramp operator you are an employee that wears many hats. You can marshal aircraft into gates, unload and load planes, transport bags to and from aircraft, scan luggage, there are many positions available to help run the operation. I've learned about the fast paced work needed to run a company in the airline industry. Management is straight forward and fair. Follow the safety guidelines and you will not be bothered. If you intend to join leadership you must show your worth in your work ethic and attendance. The coworkers come from all walks of life. The hardest part of the job is being exposed to the elements. Winter and rain are your greatest enemy when working on the ramp. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that you meet at work and in the terminal."
good,"I would take phone calls, and book reservations. I was also customer service, so I dealt with the complaints or compliments of the job."
good,"good co-workers, the work environment was good. The pay was good."
good,Lots of people to people interaction which makes this job great!
good,"Start crew on tasks for the day, check on progress, get parts and technical data to accomplish jobs."
good,For the short period I worked for Delta they served their customers and workplace well.  Their Managers and Supervisors are very dedicated and very good to work with.  They also promote you well.  I hated to leave but had to because of personal reasons.
good,Great place to work. This is one of the best organizations which gives best time for worklife balance and growth oppurtunities. Good to settle with good position.
good,"Reading updates and Company emails. Doing a walk through check list, going to stores and getting parts to repair listed items. Management was helpful, productive, approachable, and a pleasure to work for. The Culture was very sarcastic at times and demeaning, yet,there were a lot of times that it was enjoyable. Getting a long with some of the workers. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the ones that did get along."
good,If you can handle stress and being fast-paced all at the same time then you can handle this job.   Delta and working for any airline is not for everyone.  It is a very stressful job that can lead to medical issues.
good,"You'll get to meet regular travelers and establish a relationship with them."
good,Great job that was always fun and never boring!  Management was great and valued their employees. Benefits were also great as well. By far the best overall job I had!
good,The company is committed to offering many opportunities for its employees. My learning experience was positive but it was during a time when bankruptcy rumors were rampant.
good,Very good place to work because of team members and the staff are really helpful.The infrastructure and the ambiance is very good.I like the company standards.
good,Northwest air is a great company to work for if you need to make alot of money fast. it is hard to keep a healthy work environment when you have a real childish boss
good,"The management is great, it's a fun place to work and the coworkers are awesome. I don't mind going to work at all, it's one of my favorite jobs."
good,Every day is a new experience in this position. It is an exciting opportunity that allows you to get paid to see the world.
good,A fast paced and fun job!  Plenty of room for growth.  Top of the line customer service and benefits.  Every day is different.
good,great experience working with the public  love to travel  it gave me the chance
good,"Daily work is consistent with assisting customers with booking tickets and locating lost luggage. I was part of a special team the responded to corporate emails and inquiries. I learned patience and to not always let a customer know what you cannot do but what you CAN do for them. Management micromanage and that can reduce the work ethic of an employee. The hardest part of the job is having to be positive in the process of a customer being irate, but the good thing is pleasing and making sure their satisfied when the job is complete."
good,"a typical day is checking luggage, book flights also having flights out on time. I learned to work in a fast pace place where you have a 30min time. My coworkers are awesome .The hardest part about the job is dealing with passengers who are late. The most enjoyable time is that you get to fly for free."
good,"I answered high volume calls and emails from our customers, travel agencies and other airlines regarding refund requests. I also delivered mail and special reports for the refund department.  My management team never made us feel as though our jobs helping customers meant nothing. They valued our opinions on better ways to service customers.I worked with a great team.  Everyone worked well with one another to get our jobs done and with customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to put a customer at ease and a make them smile or laugh."
good,load and unload of fright from and to planes..learned alot about how to work with different people..the management always looking at what we have done..for my co-works is always fun to be around..for the hardest part of my job is working short of staff on the hardest day...the enjoyable part of working is always having a great team to work with..
good,"Love it and enjoy working for delta. Good place to work. great co-workers."
good,I really enjoy working at Delta. The managers and co-workers are great. Delta offers and encourages a lot of training in different departments and there is plenty of room for advancement. The best part is being able to apply to work in different cities or apply for temporary duty assignments. The only negative is that Delta is cutting the flights in Memphis and laying off workers. 
good,"• Manage a team of 3 to 10 crew members for which tasks consisted of team scheduling, compliancy with emergency protocols, special needs assignments, and team performance of designated area."
good,"logging payroll, talking with phone reps & direct co-workers. Involvement with management on a daily basis as to job functions, time keeping, attendance. No one was ""better"" than anyone else. Co-workers and I had same responsibilities and abilities. keeping track of everyone's time and attendance could be very challenging at times. Being a part of the Team was great!"
good,"Excelente relacion con los pasajeros, aprendizaje diario, un dia nunca es igual al otro."
good,Coworker are good people It outside so the weather will decide your day over all good job
good,"I loved working here. Friendly coworkers, great benefits, travel opportunities and caring managing staff. There was definitely room for advancement with the ability to transfer anywhere in the word that Delta flew. There is also the ability to be cross trained in many other areas of the airport (ie, gates, ticket counter, crown club, international gates and re-check etc.) Delta really does take care of their employees!"
good,"Working flights helping passangers to and from gates, boarding and deplaining the aircraft and moving the jet bridge to and from the aircraft . Helping customers check in there flights and bags ."
good,"A typical workday would be, arriving at work checking the schedule to make sure it was sufficient for the  operational needs  for the day. Making sure employees were in uniform and ready to work And overseeing  all aspects of the operations for the day.  I've learned that motivating employees in a positive and productive way got more positive productive results. The hardest part of the management position was finding and maintaining sufficient employees . The most enjoyable part was seeing employees become successful at what they do and enjoying it as well ."
good,"Delta Airlines is a great company to work for. The airport is a face paced work environment, so everyone pitches in and works hard, but when there are no flights on the ground you have time to relax and socialize."
good,Delta Airlines/DGS is a good place to work for individuals who wants to see the world and thinking about to study in aviation industry. Working environment changes with every different season. There are delays and cancellation with it stressful times.  There are opportunities within the company for training and promotion. Delta airlines/DGS offers the best computer based training and flight benefit as non-revenue in entire aviation industry in the US as of right now. It might change future but not clear when.
good,"Auditing complex International and Domestic fare structures and Processes passenger ticket refund claims from Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines/KLM Airlines, and Travel Agencies."
good,"Providing Problem Solutions during guest check-in. Creating daily Spreedsheets to analyzing and evaluating data from post flights. Planning and prioritizing the procedures to get the aircraft loaded and unloaded in a 20 minute turn arround time. Experience in filing, reviewing, and interpreting Legal Documents. Work effectively as a team member."
good,"extremely supportive and family oriented and team building "
good,Delta Air Lines is a great employer. Delta places its employees first because if there are no workers then the passengers. The best part about my position is having the ability to interact with customers
good,i love working with aircraft at the airport and it is not a hard job at all. its more like getting paid for what you love doing
good,This Job is a great job as well as a great company. The work environment. Everyone looks out for the everyone which makes the work life very easy.
good,All manuals and hard ware are good  may manager and lead and coworkers are grate.Best of luck for them.It is fun to be there.If I need help every body is ready which make the job more easy and secure
good,"I did same job as Prospect Airport Service, before Prospect took over the contract, I worked same with Delta Airline Global Service."
good,"Um lugar bom de trabalhar,aprendi muito alem da minha profissão,sou muito comunicativo com meu colegas de trabalho."
good,"Delta it self good company to work fr DGS is the worst be careful who you trust. Management has a core value of 0 its just a group of friends running a company and most dont care about anyone but them self, like i said Delta is good company Delta Global not so much"
good,"No longer desired to work for a company that I have no interest or future in. The benefits of this company, were no longer benefiting me or my family."
good,"Hate over opinionated, rich, entitled, spoiled, adults!? Never work in reservations for delta. Mngt only cares about the customer not the you! EVER!!!"
good,Nice and fun co-workers but very poor management and organization
good,staff and management are very harsh. people don't want to train you thinking you are trying to take there jobs everything is based on time and schedule
good,"I need a job right now.. I like too working every single week  and I no how too Helping people"
good,depending on your personal needs determines who i would recommend this job to. Some days were better then others and i enjoyed working with great people.
good,"Poor management, poor training, some people work harder than others, lots of perks, really good pay, hard labor, male dominated environment, favoritism"
good,Mejores sueldos y mejoras en el ámbito laboral mejoras en el desempeño laboral y económico
good,Love working from home just wish the pay was better.  Assisting passengers.  Being able to travel is the best part of the job.  Worst part of the job is having to go into the office and the starting pay is really bad.
good,Horrible place with lots of politics and finger pointing. Working around the clock. People are there to get you. Management is not supporting and very old school.
good,"Los días normales de trabajo son muy ocupados siempre hay algo que hacer."
good,"dias de trabalho muito bom , trabalho leve, aprendir a ser mais organizado , subordinados escelentes."
good,aprendir varia coisas novas e ganhei mas experiencia na area de trabalho a direçao é maravilhosa e meus colegas tambem
good,"Coming in to work and not having all the material to work with."
good,Delta is a great place to work except if life happens. They are very strict with time and attendance. I was put on a final for attendance because I missed 3 days of work in training because the stitches on me from a surgery  burst open during work and I had no option to stay. No medical note or anything mattered to them. No exceptions.
good,"I experienced some things that made me uncomfortable. But the work and the employees were great. Some areas of management need improvement, across the board employee treatment."
good,"I had Perfect attendance 8 year's with awards and was never late, never in trouble & no write ups. I was selected as a Trainer & volunteered on the Safety Committee. I was fired for an alleged Buddy Pass policy violation. WTF"
good,"Delta airlines is a fun place to work with amazing flight benefits. however, the jobs for advancement are few and far between and compensation is rather low for what type of work is required of you."
good,"Good family-like work culture, wonderful colleagues, flexible schedules, great flight discounts, poor management at the local level only, otherwise a very well run company on the corporate level."
good,It was ok for a while. I liked it for a short period of time. It came to me at the wrong time. I did this job right out of college.
good,"A typical day at work with me is being over a team of employees with the task of completing unloading and loading  the bins of aircrafts safely in a time given. Each day I learn more and more how to be over employees, make my work ethic even better, and doing anything and everything to make my job that I do great and advance in the company. My co-workers are amazing and make my job fun to do. Hardest part of the job is making sure safety is in affect while having to listen and tell employes all at the same time what to do. But I feel is an awesome asset it makes my ability to do one or more things at once an advantage to my skill set. Most enjoyable part is to know that  I'm a person that is known for a very good completion of job, very respected while doing my job and great with my co-workers."
good,A typical day at work involved Flight Operations Management responsibilities as a member of flight dispatch team.  I learned about the requirements to ensure efficiency and effectiveness of the Flight Dispatch process.  Management was good and coworkers were supportive.  The hardest part of the job was learning the job and the most enjoyable part was the flight benefits.
good,A great working environment. Top management genuinely seems to care about the employees and customers. Middle management can do with a better screening process before achieving the position
good,Working 4 Delta was a very rewarding experience very fast paced environment which I personally like a lot. I know there are a lot of people that may not like that type of environment especially because you working in the elements
good,Good place to work except in the IT industry. Great overall company to work for. The profit sharing is great but becoming a full time delta employee is very hard to do if you come through the door as a contractor.
good,"Worked with great people. Only for a short time to get flying benefits, It was a fast pace job with limited time to prepare and clean the cabin. Had to constantly ask for new duties to try and move up."
good,"My job here is very hard and not bad, the managment is very enjoy with me and. Even this travel agency is my home. We fully enjoy here and my job is full time here."
good,You are loading planes and dealing with all different types of people. The flight crews are like family and they make the day go by fast and the employees are very helpful when things get hectic.
good,"Great company to work for, but it's a LOT of hard work and the pay isn't great.  Total compensation package is pretty good."
good,"Work a lot of work. Keeps you busy, never gets boring. Customers are friendly and so are coworkers."
good,"My day consist of a ton of air crafts loaded with travelers from all over the world, once they arrive i would pull up to the air craft taxi the aircraft in the gate. Once water and air was hook up to the air craft we start to off load the carry on's and passengers luggage."
good,Delta is a global company which provides opportunities for advancement in self goals given the pay and recognition from the name itself.
good,I sincerely enjoyed my time here. It was fantastic 121 experience and a family oriented company that truly wants the best for their employees. Highly recommend!
good,"It's a great company, but it takes time to advance.  They value tenure over skill which can be problematic at times.  Reliability is a must. Interpersonal skills are very important regardless of position."
good,great place to work the bosses at Conduent for Delta HR Division are always willing to help you and you learn alot being there about HR and Payroll and other benefits
good,Delta has some amazing perks. A lot of luggage and a lot of work but with great power comes great responsibility .  overall great experience to work at delta
good,I enjoyed working with many technologies and experts in the IT industry with vast knowledge of systems engineering and design. I supported the leadership on multiple initiatives to improve the quality of systems at Delta airlines.
good,"I have had the opportunity to work on some large projects to help move forward the mission of one of Americas Fortune 100 companies. During my time here, I have had the chance to work on projects in HR and the Cyber Security space that has helped me gain a deeper understanding of overall business drivers."
good,Môi trường làm việc năng động và thân thiện hòa đồng
good,"My favorite company to have worked for thus far. Excellent compensation, unbeatable benefits, wonderful coworkers, and amazing opportunities for travel."
good,Great flying perks with ability to travel standby. A lot of different routes domestically and internationally. Supportive work culture but very old and traditional.
good,I come in to work clock in then check my email and the flight schedule.Based on the flight schedule is how i assign my teams for the day.And based on that is if the day is going to be good or bad.
good,"No day is the same. You work with very different people on every trip, and you see hundreds of faces every day. You self manage with your team and you don't have to take work home with you."
good,"Fast paced environment that requires extensive safety measures. "
good,"The best airline to work for period. Excellent opportunity for advancement, terrific supervisory staff."
good,"Every day is busy and very interesting. Its filled with different people everyday and you learn so many different things everyday. Some days are bad and some are good. Managers are on top of their duties especially when It has to do with safety. The environment I work in is different. Its not like typical offices, its outside along any different sized aircrafts and machinery. I work in a supertug towing airplanes. its exciting and I love it. Hardest part at work I would say, is when it slows down and and shifts seems longer. But its a great job and I love it."
good,"I enjoyed the work at Delta.  Every day there were different challenges."
good,"Very rewarding place of employment....would recommend company to anyone looking for a promising career in the aviation field,benefit packages,friendly work stations throughout system."
good,Work in fast pace environment and in all conditions. problem solving and ability to have flexible schedule. Great company to work for and be part of great team and amazing benefits!
good,The problem is that they don't wanna pay enough   people their is ok to get alone with plus they get your money mixed up don't get your paycheck on timeor it's not right can't click in right it's like they don't have things together as they should especially since they want their planes to be cleaned right and good. I worked bc there for 5 months I just stopped
good,it was great. very hard and adrenaline filled. it is a three part interview. many activities involving groups and solo. it was all day long and after you hired they give you a drug and alcohol test
good,"Delta is a great company to work for, the travel benefits is really what everyone is there for.... If you can get somewhere you can work full time you can make decent money. But you will have to sacrifice your time... A LOT of work, good money, LESS work no money"
good,I had fun working in Delta. The managers would have regular morale building days that would keep us motivated. I especially enjoyed the regular feedback. There was never a question about your role there.
good,"Great job with many benefits to its employees. Very demanding as far as time is concerned, however it is well worth the hard work in the end. I wouldnt leave this company."
good,"Highly desired job in Atlanta. Great way to meet new people for all parts of the country, as well as, the world. Typical duties would be load and unload luggage and freight onto planes.  I learned how to adjust in pressure situations to complete the task at hand.  The hardest part of the job was working under strenuous weather conditions.  The best part of the job was working outside in beautiful weather conditions.  The culture there was a proud and prominent one."
good,I worked at Delta an incredibly long time ago. I retired as part of the bankruptcy over 15 years ago. I enjoyed my time there but life sometimes throws you a curve ball.
good,It was a fun place to work. I will recommend a  family and friend to at Delta. Great leadership skill. I would still like to work for Delta airline  again.
good,"This is a great, fun, fast paced place to work.  Only negative is the wages. They do try to make up for that with incintives, awards and stock options."
good,"The warehouse environment here is nothing you would ever want to get used to. A lot of the people here take advantage of the opportunity and privilege they have working for Delta. The people that work hard get taken advantage of and are over worked, because they allow employees to verbally state and act out that they aren’t going to do a specific task simply because they don’t like it. The employees here do whatever they want and if they don’t want to do any work they won’t. Lazy is a understatement. It’s a great entry level job to get your foot in the door; however if you have experience in finances, IT, analyst, project management do your 6 months and move the he!! on. Don’t get caught in the dream of becoming a LEAD or Logistic Attendant or Logistic Attendant Trainer, because the majority of them don’t appreciate the $24-$30 dollars an hour plus paid overtime that they are getting either. People here abuse and disrespect Delta and all of the wonderful benefits that it offers it’s employees. They make and treat the DGS Contractors like they are unworthy. You would think working in a warehouse environment for Delta Air Lines would be different than other companies. Sorry it’s even more disappointing simply because it’s Delta Air Lines. I love Delta Air Lines and all of the wonderful things that they do, especially when it comes to supporting and giving back to the local communities. The health and flight benefits is one of the most amazing things a company could offer its employees. I KNOW I will land my dream job here at the company."
good,Love this work place excellent staff amazing job always will love this job so much and i can’t think delta enough !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,"Delta is a great company to work for with awesome benefits and a culture. I've been around Delta my entire life and was initially thrilled to work there. I'm grateful for the opportunity I've had, but am ready to fit another role that is a better fit for me."
good,A lot to say about Delta.  Loved my time at Delta.  Didn't like the benefits or sometimes the culture they encouraged within their small groups of leaders.  Need more outsiders to provide a greater picture
good,The travel benefits are amazing the pay will suck at first the more years you put in the more you get laid. Job is demanding and really don’t have tons to take full advantage of your benefits
good,Delta Air Lines is an excellent company to work for even as a contractor.  It is worth it to enter as a contractor as some contract roles become permanent.
good,Busy station good pay but takes years for a benefited full time or part time in the company. Offers free flights and profitsharing is higher then other airlines
good,"Constantly busy, fun place to work at. Management is great. The hardest part of the day is working while delays going on and having to rebook passengers."
good,El call center de Delta ya no se encuentra en Chile.
good,A typical day is not typical at delta airlines. Everyday you are faced with a new challenge that will push you to your limits. Harts field is the main hub so you have millions of people coming in and out of the airport daily.
good,"Delta is not too bad of a place to work, it's just that I was part time for 4 years and I have to still wait for full time for a little bit longer which is outrageous, but other than full time I actually love to work for Delta!!"
good,"This is a great job for young people and retired folks who would like to be involved in the transportation industry.  We are in charge of flights once they are on the ground.  We ensure passenger safety by monitoring aircraft loads and servicing the aircraft.  The hardest part of the job is the physical labor associated with loading the aircraft.  As an employee, we are granted flight benefits (we fly standby), allowing us to travel cheaply, domestic or international."
good,"Very good people, culture and benefits. Very good people to work with and a very good company. Employees are valued and respected. Great culture of setting goals etc."
good,the experienced gained was great. prepared me for working in a fast paced setting and also the skills to manage crisis at a moments notice. people are often agitated because of flight delays and Delta prepared me for those crisis
good,"I enjoyed flying to different parts of the world. I especially enjoyed that I was involved in our first flights to Central and South America"
good,"Good airline lots of benefits hard work you have to love people and travel very competitive. Lots of hours to work and flights to cover"
good,i had a lot of down time but when we got those air crofts we worked non stop.  my co workers were nice and cool. working on the air field was very cool
good,"Delta is the best company I've ever worked for. Benefits are awesome. 401k match and health benefits available. Travel all over the world! Open door policy with management. Days are long and busy, but it is worth it!"
good,"There is never a dull moment when working for Delta. Each flight was extremely different. You will always be moving around, there isn't enough time for down time."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Delta. I would have still been working there had it not been for 9-11. I met a lot of good people, benefits were good, pay was even better."
good,Great! Very lovely. Great management and staff. Great flexibility and hours. Nice pay and great coworkers. Everyone is nice and well mannered. Great opportunities
good,I never worked for delta directly work was outsourced please let me get to the job opening section thank you so much worked for another entity that was

Whenever an aircraft arrived to the gate, the assigned team of agents would prepare all equipment and begin to offload cargo. I learned many useful workplace tips on dealing with hard labor.

Depending on the day, you could work anywhere from 1-4 flights a day.The average work day would be about 12 hours which could stretch much longer. The perks of having seen the world were a definite positive. The negatives unfortunately had to do with the lack of a union and job security in a transportation industry. There also were no requirements for management and many mid level positions were handed out with no credential for the job. Despite these issues I think it was a overall a wonderful experience"

This makes for a good atmosphere, and ""positive"" is as contagious as ""negative""."

This is when we would do introductions and go over key elements of the trip, such as duties, weather and any other points that were necessary.  I usually did 3 day trips with different crews and by the end of the trip I usually had made some great friends.  "
good,"Experienced this airline change from not just surviving airline deregulation, low-cost upstarts, mergers, and bankruptcies, but to position itself to become the world leader in the industry. My work changed as safety concerns swept through the workplace and the attitudes improved concerning employee value. The work was professional and the employees exhibited the highest moral values. Work was technically advanced, training was available, and a wide variety of positions were available. Rewards stemmed from achieving daily goals in the work place and from being a contributing member of a progressive world-class airline."
good,My managers were very knowledgeable about the systems as well as the tools.

good,Flight Attendant
good,"Delta is an established organzation that places a strong emphasis on thier employees. It has employees that represet all socio, racial and ecnomic backgrounds which in part contributes to the success of the company.

good,If 9/11 never happened I would still be working for Northwest well Delta now. During that time I was on a 1 year leave having just given birth to my youngest daughter.

good,customer satisfaction
good,Gained flight operations experience such as creating flight load reports.
good,Very competitive environment full of challenges.  This company is not for the faint of heart.  Customer service values are off the chart!  Performance is driven by world-class leaders.   Majority of the workforce is non-unionized.  Professional / personal life balance is off centered; quality of life is often a sacrifice to drive pass travel and annual profit sharing incentives.
good,This company is the best company I ever worked for. I really like this this company. The only thing is the pay is really low compared to the same jobs nationally.

I am also eager to create an impact in others life, understanding that I have to be a great server before I can think about Leading."

good,As a telesales agent am tasked with calling customers to get orders of Coca cola products for delivery the next day. I work hand to hand with the sales representative as they do the cold calling and customer generation in the market. I have been with Delta Beverages for twelve years I have learnt alot in my career as I have risen from been a machine operator to a telesales agent. I have combined my eagerness to learn and my advancement in my education to be where i am. I have learnt that nothing is impossible if you are willing to be taught. The management has been of great support as they allowed me to acquire education loans to pay for my tuition and giving me the time to study. I have worked with alot of people since I joined the company and all of them taught me so many lessons which I cherish forever. My co-workers are supportive and encouraging me in my career. The hardest part of my job is that between my work and study I find little or no time for family. It as allowed me to grow in my career.
good,"This was a very fun job, a lot of travel, meeting new people all over the country, made a lot of very good friends. The stability and job security was low as they were going through the Merger with Delta after filling for bankruptcy."
good,"I did like working their ,mainly because their was always something new being learned,and their is always a schedule that you have to meet. The workers are friendly people and most often get along. Sometimes being short staffed brought added stress but everyone communicated with each other and we met all our schedules. The only draw back with the company is that it is a ready reserve position,which means that you don't have any medical or retirement benefits.Plus the 4a.m. start time requires you change any nocturnal habits you may have, but hard to do if you hold down more than one job. One of the better aspects of the job is that you can fly anywhere in the World Delta fly's for just the once a year fuel tax that is required. That is a pretty good perk if you can fit that in your busy schedule."
good,"My hours were limited to work, their were no activities besides my job."
good,"•	Airport Customer Services, Assisting passengers with boarding the aircraft, booking and reissuing tickets for passengers that have miss their connecting flights, rebooking from one destination to another.

good,"A typical work day was getting to work on time have three planes on the ground that needs to leave within ten minutes apart. Which each plane have to have the rite bags and people on them. Also they need the rite paper work that allows them to know how many people, bags, boxes, ands weight. This goes on the for the whole day. "
good,"Screening passengers for Delta Airlines,I learned how to do bomb sweeps,Management was great,I really liked my co-workers,The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting all of the nationalities I got to know,The hardest part of the job was leaving.. "
good,"The weather was the largest indicator of how my day would go while employed with Delta. My career with Delta taught me how to handle difficult customer situations with care and understanding. I also learned how to convey time sensitive and safety sensitive information to customers and crew members through public speaking. The Management team and co-workers were like family which made the job easier to handle. The most difficult part of the job was not being able to advance. It seems once you're in a certain area they want to keep you there especially if you do not have a degree. It's hard working every weekend and holidays, but the sense of family made it easier to bear."
good,"A Empesa de um modo geral é muito boa, sempe pagava em dia, o que era solicitado ao encarregado sempre era atendido, já que a empresa presta serviço a órgãos públicos e a única pessoa da empresa que se mantinha contato é o encarregado que fica no próprio orgão onde o serviço dela é prestado."
good,I've been in the customer service industry for almost 25 years and there's not a day that goes by that I don't learn something new. Everyday is an adventure.
good,Ticket and book flights while communicating reservation information effectively
good,This is a lifestyle not a job make sure you’re ready for it and remember when you do your interview this is all you have to think in your head:  Customer service customer service customer service.
good,I actually love working for delta but you really need to enjoy people and be patient.  You get a lot of upset passengers if a plane is late or delayed and have to be able to handle that.  Overall it’s a great company.
good,"The culture, people and work environment is great.  Training is excellent, but the health plan is bad.  Dental and vision are okay though.  I worked in reservations in Tampa, FL, and the play is low but standard, since the big selling point is the travel benefits.  What stinks about those is that if you want to go anywhere, it's standby, and you have to go through Atlanta, which is terrible even when you pay.  Travel benefits are by seniority, so you could plan a trip months in advance, get to the airport, and when you're there someone with more seniority could arrive and bump you from the flight.  But if you have the time and are willing to put up with getting bumped in Atlanta (and other places) it could work for you."
good,I always said it's not the company it's the people that bring negative behavior and mis-use their authority to manage others. Managers and Supervisors are people with the same standards but being in Management and setting a real positive work environment does show a positive work behavior here at JFK. It's now that Delta is looking for feedback to make adjustments to it policies. My feedback is that Supervisors and Managers show a bit more positive work environment behavior here at JFK and not set a hostile environment that makes employees uncomfortable with wanting to quit or move from there Department. I have always said over and over it's not the Company it's the people placed to manage others that makes Delta the Airline to work for.

good,"I love the benefits, very nice place to work, relaxed environment but yet professional. Very great place to advance from within the company. I love the flight benefits."
good,I found the job to be exciting at times when I helping to park the air planes. I also found the job to be challenging when I had to work poor to terrible working conditions.
good,It was great being able to work inside the hangars with the commercial jets. It really gave the feeling of importance clocking in everyday. The job was very laid back and stress free. My supervisor was great to work with but his bosses could come off harsh and close minded at times.
good,"Started with Delta Airlines right after graduating high school. It was a very interesting job because of all the different parts of jobs the employees were to do. Jobs were bid for by seniority, as well as days off and hours. Learned to drive everything from bag tugs, to forklifts, and container loaders. Learned a lot with Delta in the 23 years of service."

good,Management was very bad they treat they co workers like bad. And they supervisor smoke on the ramp everyday it sad case there they don't know follow delta rules.
good,"Delta is and always will be a part of my Family."
good,"Great company, wish I was still there..  Opportunities exist but aggressive networking and relationship building required.  Great people and the management is objective and fair."
good,"I loved this job and the experience that came with it. It was something I would have continued to do if my relationship had not grown and I had not become a mother. I can't imagine flying with small children on the ground states away. A lot of moms do it, however, to each their own."
good,"respeto de todos los compañeros de trabajo. me presenteba unos 20 minutos antes de la hora de trabajo, el gerente es una persona muy atenta con los empleados, lo mas dificil fue cuando me cambiaro a la rivera maya ya que es una zona de mucho riesgo y era de todos los dias a la hora pico cuando hay mucho movimiento de transporte pesado eso es de muy alto riesgo."
good,"I love being on the ramp, my day was always an adventure, yes it was repetitious but none the less fun. We worked planes one at time, dealing with a variety of different types of Aircraft. From a CRJ200 to a Airbus A-330. Never a dull moment, always on the move, it was a very physical job for sure. Its the type of job you must be willing to learn to the fullest and to be able to adapt to the forever changing climate. You could spend hours on the ramp in the rain, sleet, snow, fog, heat or cold. I always strived to the be the best at whatever I did. Never give up attitude, I always lead by example. I believe in seeing the good in all of us and getting along with everyone, its what built great chemistry and teamwork, and it helped us to meet, sustain, maintain, and surpass company goals, and industry standards. I was always proud of being a part of that team. I love what I do and put forth the very best in whatever I do, always have and always will. I take pride in myself, my family, and my career."
good,"I was a Customer Service Agent and when working at the gates I met aircraft, deplaned customers, boarded the planes and dispatched the aircrafts for take-off.  I was also responsible for various areas of airline ticketing including sky priority, special services, bag drop, and assisting on the kiosk machines all while providing excellent customer service."
good,the typical days at work be the days when we have big flights and a lot of customers boarding the craft with major luggage. I learned about different aircrafts and what not to do and to do when working with aircrafts. The co-workers were easy to get along with and we worked like a dedicated team to getting the craft out on time. The hardest part of the job was working in the rain and sun but it wasn't at times as bad as I thought it would have been for me. the most enjoyable part of the job was unloading the charter planes especially when the football teams came in from their flight and working the ramp at night time.
good,"A typical day was  very busy. My job was in a  Call Center. I did  answer about 80 plus calls a day I booked and traced different commodities like flowers  (inbound)  and pets (outbound),  I love  animals  so booking pets  was  fun for me.   "
good,Delta is a great company to work for. there are vast benefits.
good,This was a great place to work. We all had team focus. Everyone work as a team
good,"Great place to work. Fast pace, challenging, and diversity of different cultures"
good,"I manage bench stocks, replenish stocks, maintained appropriate stock level on hand, review stock records, and establish or adjust stock levels, pulled and ordered part for matenance."
good,"Management in Logistic and Supply Chain, ASr Operations Professional"
good,Management was great. Fun enviroment to work. Hardest part is long flights and time away from family. Most enjoyable was interating with customers and experiencing different cultures. Co-workers varied as in any environment. Overall great experience.
good,"A typical day as a Delta Air Lines Flight Attendant began with entering the Delta Flight Attendant Lounge and signing in for my trip. I generally flew to Europe and/or South America. According to seniority, we would select which cabin we were to be working in such as Business or Coach (the ""back"") and which day we would be working that particular cabin. I found my co-workers were unique as far as their backgrounds went and how long they had been flying. The hardest part of my job was the many different time changes and not being able to adjust to flying when I should have been asleep and vice versa. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting so many different travelers/customers. I also enjoyed traveling to different parts of Europe such as Barcelona and Milan and also to Lima, Peru."
good,excellent company delta shut down operations.Due to competitve out sourcing
good,My shift was 5a-330p three days a week. There is a great deal of flexibility to trade days and shifts to accommodate personal time and travel. Everyone is upbeat and knowledgeable to the travel industry and meeting the needs of the travelers. The hardest part is assisting those whom are bring back loved ones from the war.
good,Its interesting when you get to assist different people from around the world everyday. Delta is a very challenging job to work in. Its like going to work blind folded never know what to expect. A typical day at work would be checking in passengers into flights then working the outgoing flights.
good,Loved speaking with people from all over the world/ helping them with their travel arrangments
good,"Delta is a great company as it is, being in business for a long time but managers there are not educated some dont even have hs diploma how can they lead a company? Education and experience go together, is hard to advance because people in management that being there for 20+ years dont allow to innovate or the opportunity to grow because of jealousy that they will lose their job. Delta could have been a great great company if they allow agents to show their potential on how to make this company greater .....an employee"
good,"es una excelenet empresa para trabajar y desarrollarse, lo unico que los cargos gerenciales son extremadamente estresantes"
good,"Because of the flexibility I have I am able to avoid burn out and remain happy crew member and serve passengers with pleasure, delight and a fresh smile"
good,"Great job management was really"
good,"As with anything in life, its what you make it. The opportunity to advance is there as well. Its hard work and its in the elements but you will survive and suceed."
good,"I learned how to manage and deal with multiple personalities, problem solve without any supervision I also learned to improve my time management skills."
good,Good company for pilots. I felt I was always backed by management for my decisions. PBS bidding made for flexible scheduling. I commuted for my entire career.
good,"Fun, exciting, place to work with generous perks and a very generous profit sharing. I would strongly recommend Delta to others. However, advancement is slow unless your in a hub city."
good,Hardest part of my position was when bad weather hit.  It can be difficult finding alternatives for customers during these periods.  Delta provides a lot of training on various systems and the opportunity to job shadow in other departments.  We would generally have some type of departmental celebration or recognition each month.
good,"Meet a lot of people, fun, busy, competitive and most rewarding you travel around the world for free. great co-worker. Delta is a family,  some times it could be very stressful during the time of interrupted flights, especially when there is a lot of flight cancelations and there is no flight to book passengers. overall, you learn and give customer service from the heart."
good,At work place there  should always be employee engagement activities to keep employee stress free and happy to take new responsibility. Like Lunch with whole team.Outside Lunch etc.
good,"If you live outside the US, expect little to no mobility in your job and opportunities to do so."
good,"It has been great working in Delta Air lines. I grew so much and my knowledge base on the airline industry deepen and makes me want to learn even more.great benefits, great working environment."
good,"I loved it . Left it for a stable federal position. The job was great I loved the people, not everyone was perfect but we all were respectful. There are some great co workers and management was amazing. I have never found a better job , if they had better benefits I would have never left and retired long years from now."
good,"I love this company, but it forces me to work other irregular jobs just to keep this job so that I will have flight benefits which in the long run does not add up to having health insurance and being able to keep a roof over your head.  In my situation having just an apartment by yourself is completely out of the question for how much the apartments cost in this area.  You have to have 2+ jobs and a roommate to make it work and it is still barely affordable, under these conditions, to keep this job.  It is a family environment type of company but many people still end up quitting because they have to live."
good,Overall I worked with Delta for four years as an Application Project Manager and a Sr. IT Project Manger and it was one of the most fulfilling times of my career. The teams that I had the privilege of working with were great and we implemented some projects that were key to the financial success of the organization as a whole.
good,Great company to work for. Many opportunities to advance and grow. Great benefits. Many resources available for work and personal life. Very supportive leadership.
good,"You may have an airplane coming into the gate at your start time and the day only gets busier from there. There were days when we would have three planes waiting too be parked at the same time (with a total of seven people to do the work.) Time would go by so fast. Nine of my thirteen years were spent in Las Vegas. That was hot in the summer afternoons, but I enjoyed it. In Freeland Mi. it was cold being up in the bucket truck deicing a plane at 5 a.m. in February."
good,"Delta project is a complex global implementation, timeline were very tight so there was always a lot of pressure. Even with all the pressure work culture was enjoyable because of the friendly and helpful people"
good,"Professional job , dealing with many cultures and fun also need to be respectful and flowing the rolls exactly plus keep update trining always and know how to be professional with customer and assist them with a great service and smile."
good,Glad I had chance to work here. Has great  Views or  natural Landscape. Worked at two other stations as well. So it is nice to be to relocate to different states if you want to.
good,"fast paced work environment in which you have the ability to work with many different cultures  and get to know your coworkers. the ability to double as a part agent, gives you the ability to have a more flexible life  schedule."
good,I actually wish I never left Delta - the bankruptcy and pending Northwest merger did not provide with with mental security that they would not eliminate my department of one.
good,I grow up professionally working in this industry. Very organized and supportive system.The chance to manage difficult situations in a manner of minutes with a working team supporting and engaging in complicated or surprising situations under pressure that need to be done in perfection with a relaxed and smiling face. The opportunity to meet people around the world in a daily basis.
good,the culture was family friendly. The company as a whole really cared about the employees. I lost 2 grandparents and received flowers and cards both times.
good,Great place to work with a great corporate culture. Leaders heavily influence the work life balance and demands. Certainly an organization that allows you to exercise initiative and make mistakes.
good,Delta is a grate place to work but its very difficult to advance into a new position or career within the company if you do not have any sort of connections / friend or relative working with the department. Secondly as a ready reserve agent it takes years to be considered for full time and its difficult to provide for your family as a ready reserve agent because you are only required to work a fix amount of hours through out the year and cant pick up any overtime.
good,"Great company. Excellent benefits, very flexible. Meet people from all walks of life. Advancement were allowed and very busy environment. It was one big family."
good,I loved working here.  It is a life style not a job.  The people who work there are amazing.  The management can be unsteady.  The hardest part was when things go wrong.  they go really wrong.
good,"busy, but fun there were times when you didn't want to be there really on IROP days. but over all it was an ok place to be you could be yourself. And people respected you for you realness"
good,"This was one of my funnest jobs to work at. Mainly because my co-workers made it an enjoyable place to work at. The job was not too difficult to learn but after I figured out most of the bag scanners and the computer affiliation with it, the job was smooth sailing. While working here the best part was getting free flights wherever I wanted, but the pay was not that great."
good,"Great, love working at the airport, good people,good times of cleaning the airplane and learning aviation stuff......"
good,A fun and interesting place to work. Always something new and many different jobs you can perform. Will be able to find a job to suit you.
good,"meeting and helping our customers reach their destination world wide,the learning environment great multi tasking ,communicating with our customers intermittly,and delivering the superior delta experience fun and professional co workers,"
good,Commute is over 100 miles each way. Loved working with the people in a smaller location. Customer very friendly and easy day with less traffic control.
good,That is my first job in US. Nice working team. I always met support and understanding from other workers. I liked the work though not exactly work in their specialty I have sought and looking for an opportunity to find a dream job for me in specialty which later has come true.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them."
good,"Delta is like a family that adopted me in. Everyone is friendly and helpful. The job itself is so much fun and rewarding. Being on board the aircraft and providing friendly efficient customer service is fun and rewarding. I love every aspect of my job except having to commute from my home to my base. Although it does not cost me to travel, it does take a lot of time to plan for the travel and actually get to my base."
good,Great company to work for! Got to work with a talented group of individuals on a day to day base. I left to make more money...
good,"Delta Air Lines is a great place to work overall.  However, you have departments such as Reservations, Airport Customer Service and Ramp Operations where you can get stuck in these departments and have little to no chance for career growth."
good,if u don't have a second job and can only be with delta part time don't mess with them. Ive seen a lot of people come and go and everyone complains
good,My typical day at work will consist of hard work and dedication learning new things
good,"A typical day starts with answering emails from freight forwards, vendors and employees; analyzing spend reports, tracking shipments, filing claims for lost freight and ordering supplies."
good,you work hard and keep busy. i enjoyed working with the other employees
good,Delta is a great company and it is a privilege to work for a company as great as delta airlines.
good,"I was hired in as a receptionist and within 5 years I moved up two positions to office manager. I supported two managers and the 8 sales managers as well as managed the team of secretaries. Very busy very hectic. Sports marketing, reservations, relationships, event planning and management, accounting, training, policies and procedures."
good,"Work day usually started with training new hires, developing materials, working boarding areas, assisting passengers. great co workers and management staff. the hardest thing about the job was working cancelled flights, the best thing about the job was the flight benefits."
good,"The culture at Delta is great, the training was great, and the benefits are great however, even though my sakes were in the top 15% of the company every month and I grossed $50,000 every month, when a parent became terminally ill, they had to let me go because I needed to take a day off."
good,At Delta its all about customer service and communication.
good,Hard job in the winter time and good in the summer  I enjoyed the job.
good,This job was the best thing that happened to me .No two days were alike as we prepared aircraft and passengers to get to their destinations safely. my coworkers were very knowledgeable and would go the extra mile to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of job was knowing that we got people there safely and on time .Our management was very caring and good to the workers in fostering a great place to work
good,My work was always well received.  The team and family environment was incredible.
good,"I loved working in reservations, dealing with the customers over the phone assisting with booking reservations. Customers as well as management give you compliments quite often plus incentives."
good, Responsible for maintaining safety and security of the ramp at all times;
good,"Working for Delta Air Lines was a pleasure with the atmosphere being laid back, yet still a professional work place. The addition of the cafeteria and gym made it a more cost and health friendly place to work. The most enjoyable part of my job was the short commute and the care and concern from co-workers on a personal level."
good,It’s a wonderful place to work wonderful people like family. Everyone willing to help everyone. The pay is the only thing that needs an advancement other than that I love the job.
good,"Delta is a great company to grow with! You will enjoy the work-life balance, culture and all-around comradery at Delta. It is a very inclusive company that never settles and always surprises."
good,Good place to work; worked for 3 years and management has tremendously helped with my schedule for school; flight benefits are not too great but the overall company culture is amazing
good,"Great place ad company to work for. When its your scheduled time to go home, you go home! the workplace is a great atmosphere, agents get along, everyone is held accountable for their job responsibly fairly and consistently. There are great opportunities to grow and move around within the company."
good,"There a great culture to work for, I just wish there were more benefits for Ready Reserves and more structured seasonal in Tampa. Great job to have for travel benefits."
good,"My most rewarding career to date, I love what I do and I love the travel benefit even more. Right now I’m commuting but my life will improve tremendously when I transfer to LAX."
good,"Delta is what you make it. Its another job but the travel benefits are well worth it. Not too stressful, depending on who you work with it can be a really fun place. Work is not hard if you are somewhat in shape and depending on where you are located. I'm a former athlete so throwing bags in a plane was nothing for me but was a big struggle for some. There's opportunity for growth which is great. Overall good company."
good,good company with a great training program.  Wasn't a big fan of the health insurance benefits but at least they offered something. Can travel for free as long as you are not in a rush to get there but if you are then they do offer discounts.
good,"Customer service/in coming sales calls."
good,The job can become a little overwhelming when other employees do not do their part. I love the benefits that the job come with. You do have to work in every weather conditions. I just wish they gave raises more often because they are a big company and their employee deserve more for what they are doing.
good,International airport culture creates a fast-paced environment in order to reach expectations of flights and employers. Competitive to get employed due to the benefits they offer to employees.
good,"Entry level is part time and moving up is difficult. Not much flexibility with scheduling but every station is different. Good pay for part time, but not enough to live off of alone. With 5 day work schedules its hard to work another job."
good,Delta was an amazing work place. I left after graduating college with a bachelors and their wasn’t job advancement. I loved the call center and the culture.
good,"This company is so amazing, the other benefits that come with working here is what make working there worth it. "
good,"it was amazing, I enjoy aviation, and what we do. We are the safety that brings in the planes and sends the plane out. We provide customer service you."
good,this job is only for those who need part time work and want to fly for free. the pay is very low. after 30 hours a week and after taxes the check might be $575. the hours are 5 hours a day 5 days a week for at least the first 2 years. you have to be at work almost 45-30 mins early just to get through the security and take the bus to the terminal to clock in on time.
good,Great workplace great people very well compensated. Management headquarters is a different culture than the front line employees however. Still overall great experience.
good,"Delta Air Lines is truly a place to work with passion. Quality work environment, Perfect Leadership and good career growth are some keywords I have learned while working in Delta Air Lines. It is always a dream place for me to work."
good,Delta Air Lines was a great place to work.  They shared with Sodexo and only offered the best for their employees.  If something were broken it would be fixed right away.
good,"Delta is by far the best company I have ever worked for; I have never had anything negative to say, however, the hours are long and tiring starting out, the time away from home and family is very very long and frustrating. When people think of a Delta flight attendant they always see the perfectly put together, fresh faced person strolling through an busy airport with nothing on their mind but great adventure and fun times ahead... that is a misconception-- we are worried about our kids at home, our next flight and if we are going to be rerouted to another location that is out of our control or desire. I would have been a flight attendant for life if I was home more than 7 days a month and got to see my babies grow up and my husband happy. If you are single, under 24, and have an expendable income than this is the perfect career for you. I would love to go back, but alas-- life happens."
good,"Great opportunity for those who want a fast-paced lifestyle with travel opportunities.  It is important to be committed to a life style that requires many hours away from home, and often for days at a time.  Amazing opportunity to see the world!"
good,"Worked midnights mostly as I was also attending school. I learned the airline service business at Delta. For the most part management was good, but not so much as I neared retirement on the '90's."
good,"A typical day at delta?.  My days use to start at 4:30 am  and 1:30pm,  with plenty of opportunities for overtime.  I started on the ramp. Moved around in operations and advanced to customer service over the years. As a gate agent, received,  boarded and dispatched flights.   I learned so much that we can share during the interview.  Management was great unless targeted.  The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the passengers and standing at the gate to watch the plane take off, knowing I was part of that process."
good,"I enjoy working for Delta Airlines, because it offers flexible hours and travel benefits. I do wish the pay was higher but not being full-time you are not offered as many hours as you want."
good,"Great company to work for. They don't teach you everything you need to know, just the basics and you are on your own. You must Ask your colleagues  for help."
good,Delta Air Lines is a great company to work for.  The company promotes ownership in every employee/contractor.  Leadership is very driven yet responsive to their employees.
good,A typical day at work is spent problem solving and retaining customers. I've learned a lot about the aviation industry. Management is very relatable. Work culture is family oriented. The best part of the job is resolving issues for customers.
good,"Great place to work, solid business performance.  Flexible hours, great benefits.  Wide variety of professions are available inside the walls of this company."
good,"Working as a flight attendant for Delta was a great experience. The community as a whole was inspiring to work for. Being a new flight attendant for any company does come great challenges. This position does consume your life for the first year or so. Overall, a great experience but if you are planning on commuting to your base, think again!"
good,Enjoy meeting new people of all ages and nationalities.  Giving great customer service.  It's nothing hard about the job.  You will love it just hard to become full time.
good,This was a great Job & experience for years. I had earned my Position as a Lead Ramp Agent...then A Senior Customer Service Agent in Special Services / Ticket Counter-Gate Area...then Delta purchased Pan Am Airlines therefore Delta required a Mass Lay-Off.
good,"On a typical day on the ramp we would start our days at 4 am and we started with our POI's (Pre Operational Inspections) on all equipment.  All agents were trained to write up the POI's and write up if equipment needed maintenance. We worked on teams of 4 to load and offload aircrafts in a 15 to 20 minute time frame. Once in rhythm it went by quick, loading and offloading of bags were being done in no time. Hardest but most enjoyable part of the day were noons, noon flights were the most busy. Two planes on the ground being done simultaneously, time just flew by. Then night shift consisted of offloading, cleaning, and securing the RON (Remain Over Night) Flights."
good,"A typical day at Delta Air Lines at LaGuardia is rare and when you do you do your regular inspection of the terminal and my teams performance.  Always making sure that they are up to date with their knowledge and following Delta's guidelines.  The hardest part of my job is telling my passengers that their flight has cancelled for what ever the reason maybe.  Another hard part of my job is writing up a good agent say for attendance, job performance or even terminating an employee.  "
good,"Many years spent working in Revenue Management.  This is an area with high low level analyst turnover.   It's a great stepping off point for other areas within Delta, or to gain a few years experience prior to leaving."
good,"Always organized with a good on-time performance.  Each sector worked hand in hand to achieve the goal.  Committed to excellent customer service by running smooth operations from check-in, to boarding, take-off and landing.  Managers made sure that we had everything we needed before closing the doors.  Co-workers were friendly and hard-working. Would sometimes have difficulty appeasing customers who get re-routed due to weather delays.  Very rewarding to see customers smile back at you and let you know how satisfied they are with your service. Overall work experience-wonderful!"
good,"Overall UI enjoyed my job at Delta.  Was not a big fan of some in management I feel this was because a lot of us began losing our jobs in accounting due to out sourcing.  Started bring in other s from the out side and at that point in my life with Delta felt caught at the age of 45 not sure where my future would end up.  "
good,agradable ambiente de trabajo. una nueva experiencia laboral.
good,"Everything about their system and work ethics is excellent except a few supervisors that comes to work disrupt the work place and single out some employees who might not be doing anything, but they feel at ease to bring a certain level of their maliciousness to you that they should have left at home."
good,"I absolutely loved this job.  I started my career at the age of 22 and spent 20 years as a Flight Attendant.  I have seen the world and interacted with all types of people from every corner of the world.  Safety was first and foremost onboard the airplane.  Providing the best customer service was right behind safety.  As a Flight Attendant, we spent the most quality time with our customers.  It was our job to procure their loyalty to Delta Airlines and keep them coming back for all of their business and personal travel.  There was never a dull moment and the job was not only rewarding, but so much fun."
good,"opening of the club setting up place how to not to take passengers rudeness personal my management were flexible look for my best interest I work with a great group of people having to be at work at 4:30 in the morning, customers smile on there's faces"
good,"Typical day was setting up the aircraft for passengers service,welcoming passengers,and being responsible for the safety and security of people on international and domestic flights."
good,"Supervised, briefed and conducted arrival and departure of aircrafts."
good,"Professional environment, teaches great customer service skills"
good,"the job is fun and some times fast paced. my only concern is managements inability to adequately fill staffing holes in the operation to allow more fluidity on the Job. The job is also a well cultured and diverse  workplace. I've learned a great deal of skills, to include time management, as well as how to work well with others and how to finish task under pressure."
good,"feels like one big family. worked there for three years as and A and P mechanic and got laid off after sept 11. was one of the greatest jobs I could ever ask for. free flights are a plus. you will learn a lot about aircraft models, specs and different processes."
good,it is fun to work this company. working in this compnay is very career hing performace
good,Ensured the safety and comfort of all passengers. Made sure that we all knew how to work all medical equipment and CPR. Communicated with pilots throughout all phases of flight.
good,"In a typical day's work, I was responsible for ensuring customer satisfaction with as fast possible service.While at Delta, I learned to multitask proficiently in telecommunications while navigating several websites at once. I found the team work atmosphere to excellent.  and enjoyable. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the long and time consuming commute to and from the work place. The most enjoyable part of this job was the satisfaction I gained from knowing and seeing the investment of my professional customer service skills in repeat client business time and time again."
good,great second job excellent travel benefits. you will meet exciting people. this company is very diverse. has nice incentives
good,"Uma empresa que da suporte ao empregado , onde todos ajudam voce a realizar melhor seu trabalho, o supervisor te dá toda atenção possivel para que não se tenha duvidas na função"
good,Productive making sure flights go out at a timely matter must be on time. Very busy and also must have a state of mind to do the job requirements.
good,"A typical day at work would be going above and beyond to satisfy the passenger's travel experience. While solving ticketing issues, checking in passengers, and working inbound and outbound flights."
good,"Little direction, unclear goals, average management. Co-workers do their best with what they receive."
good,"Loved working for delta. just untypical hours and off days."
good,I loved working for NWA I didn't even care that I only made nine dollars an hours it was fun. But 9/11 happened and I got laid off and now it is Delta
good,I love what I do at Delta Air Lines. I meet different people every day I enjoy it to the fullest.
good,Unbelievable ability to explore so many different job opportunities within the same company. Employee opportunities and career training are always available to each and everyone. Great experience!
good,"Being a Ready Reserve agent allows for college students, travelers, or someone one with a full time job work flexible hours. The easiest part of the job is talking to customers and pointing them in the right direction. As well as making the flying proces as enjoyable as possible for the customer. The hardest is dealing with irregular operations and getting all of the customers to their final destinations despite the obstacles."
good,Working there was fun benefits are great and the people are nice and I love flying free
good,"uma empresa boa para se trabalhar, paga certinho  !!"
good,"Great work culture and flight benefits! Many career advancement opportunities. Awesome management and leadership. Educational scholarships available, plus profit sharing."
good,It was a great place to work. Worked with so many great people. This company has really good benefits  great for family. My family enjoyed the benefits. The management is really great.
good,I enjoy talking to the passengers. My coworkers are very helpful. We fly standby SC3 status. Management is great to work for. The company is growing. 👍🏾
good,Had an exellent time working here had to move out of state due to family. I had a really good time with the knowledge I acquired and the places I got to do and see here.
good,Company very catering to family life. The company is very structured and most leadership is very accommodating to family life. I definitely feel that this company has the best overall benefit package in Atlanta.
good,Everyone is super friendly. I was pretty happy going to work every since day. everyone work together like a family. pay was ok. I learned how to work together.
good,Good place to work..fast paced and hard work but good benefits plus flight privileges. Work conditions can be difficult and hours can be compromising. But the pay raise and profit sharing nake up for it.
good,"Working in the ramp can be a very rewarding job if you like physical jobs. Nashille airport is steadily growing. Busy airport = crazy town. Slow airport = ghost town. When busy, flights overlap. Lots of hustle and bustle. Sometimes there is a very short window for ""turning a flight"" that can be stressful. Slow travel days are always the worst for me. Hours between flights... time drags by. Be advised. It is an outside job so exposure to extreme hot and cold are part of the job."
good,"Love this job/ company as a whole. Great company to work for. Definitely want a full career and build from within with this amazing company. The team work is amazing and each and everyone thrivea to make it a great culture, and safe work environment."
good,Best place I've ever worked for because of the teamwork experience. Managers genuinely care about your safety and they encourage you on a daily basis to do the best you can!
good,"- Back to Back phone calls"
good,Great place to work and great management team.  It is a busy job with lots of opportunities for you to work as much or a little as you want. The travel benefits are amazing as well.
good,I loved this job. I   wish I   had never took the other job I applied for at the same time. The people were great and the job was fairly easy. If you want good benefits and great atmosphere go here
good,"I learned to manage time in a high stress environment. A typical day was challenging but with the tools to make it through. Management at my station was excellent, they looked out for you and anything you needed to improve your work. The most enjoyable part was working with good management and team members."
good,"I absolutely loved my job at Delta. Between my peers, the job in and of itself and the management I actually looked forward to going to work 95% of the time. Add on the flight benefits and perks of being an employee and I honestly never wanted to leave and regret doing so to this day."
good,its a great company to work for with lots of flexibility. The number one perk is the travel benefits and the ability to relocate as needed. you can work in any city as long as there is an opening.
good,Creative environment with ample support and tools for success. Great opportunity for travel and good work/home life balance. Amazing benefits for both employee and employee family members
good,"Working at Delta Air lines was a great experience, learned the fast pace environment without being stressful, enjoy the diversity of cultures and how we (team/coworkers) learned from each other.  Enjoyed Diversity day with a BBQ Delta does every year for all the workforce.  Sometimes some managers did not understand that you don't feel well or have childcare situations (downside ;-( ).  Overall great company to work for."
good,Working for northwest/delta was the best job ever.very flexible work hours.regret leaving because they received a pay raise 3 months after I left. This place was the first time I felt like a family at the work place.i miss my coworker's more than anything more then flying.such a good work atmosphere. I was proud to were the uniform.
good,Productive and fun workplace with ping pong table . A typical day at work is my first day. Nice coworkers and they help me a lot to improve my performance.
good,"Working at Delta was a good experience. I had never work in a call center, so it was very new to me. Their training is good to prepare you for the job. The perks are great if you enjoy travel."
good,Epect Shift work and mid days off for most of your career. Ability to swap days off and schedules make job and home life somewhat balanced . Best company ever!
good,"Pros"
good,"Great Company "
good,Delta Air Lines provided me a great foundation to build wealth and establish a work history. I enjoyed my time with the company. They afforded me the opportunity to travel the world!Delta is a great company and highly recommend them as an employer!
good,"I would have worked there for free if I didn't have bills to pay.  If 9/11 did not happen I would still be there.  They pushed the employees to learn, follow specs and treated their people great.  The only reason I gave it 1 star in Job Security is...well I got laid off and had to find another place to work."
good,"The work environment was great and the people I worked with even better. They have invested a lot in technology and will get better results out of employees. Flexible schedules for full time employees. "
good,Great place to work with awesome benefits. I have been working with this company for 12years. At times it can be difficult but the money and friends I have made here is unmatched to any job I have ever had.
good,"In delta I learned the most out of any job it was also my first job. "
good,During my time spent with Delta the experience has been great. You get to meet people from different parts of the States as well as get to visit them on your off time. Have and will recommend this job to anyone interested in working with an airline.
good,Friendly and fun atmosphere.  Management cares about employees. The hardest part of the job is when the weather was bad and I had to try and find flights for people that were cancelled.
good,I truly Like being at DMS under Delta but The continuation of being a contract worker for over 2 years is just not it.  Then to be over looked by management so they could offer the full time positions to workers who have left this company and come back because they've opened Full time positions isn't right
good,"Consider yourself fortunate to work for Delta Air Lines.  They take care of their people who take care of their customers.  They have a unique culture that is not matched or duplicated by any other company I know.  In an industry that is 99% unionized, the majority of the 80,000 employees worldwide are not in a union, and that's not by accident."
good,Work in a division of Delta called MLT. This division is run by people who know little about Delta’s culture and policy administration. This division could improve with leadership restructuring.
good,"Good starting job. Great culture. Good company to grow with if you start in the same area you want to grow in, it seems easier to get a position in another area from outside than from within. Aside from that, growing inside the company is possible."
good,"flight benefits on all delta operated flights. After one year you can pay a small fee to get on flights who are partners with delta, very enjoyable and fun."
good,"Very friendly place to be, good environment with very good manager that knows how to run the place. A little sexist about what females should do, but I guess they keep in mind line work is hard for a womans body."
good,"Great for those global citizens, however you must be willing to sacrifice other professional goals ( i.e. school) during your first few years until you gain seniority due to inflexible scheduling."
good,"Delta Air Lines has great travel benefits for it's employees. The SLC airport management team was horrible to work for. It was hard being a women in a supervisor roll, I never felt like I had a voice that was heard or appreciated. Delta hires what are called Ready Reserve postions when you first get hired on, with the intention for most to become a full-time employee. They pay these employees just over minimum wage and are part-time. Ready Reserve jobs do not get health insurance, or any other benefit except to travel for free. The average wait time for getting up-graded to full time is "
good,"Everyone is really nice and caring , benefits are amazing and they feed you! The work load can be tiring especially during natural disasters. But if you can handle that then the world is yours!"
good,Overall I think Delta was a great company. Being a flight attendant allows you to work independently and you can to some degree choose how much or how often you work. Being able to travel in your free time is wonderful but it comes with challenges. It's best to find another flight attendant to go on trips with as buddy passes just aren't worth it.
good,"Perfect job for exploring new places and gives you a broadened mind. I learned a lot from working with different people and cultures. Pay is very good, but hours are long and tedious. Can be gone from home from 2 -m 14 days at a time, with the average length trip in the 4-5 day range."
good,"It's an exciting job for someone i believe in their early twenties. Once you are over thirty, I feel like it takes too long to advance and get desired trips."
good,"Don't expect to make a lot of money there, but do expect to have a fun time working with them. I think this is a very well managed organization with a great sense of culture and tradition. The only downside is that as a Read Reservist, you don't get any other benefits other than flight benefits."
good,"I worked for Delta for 6 months before relocating. I like the job and I only relocated for family relocating. It was a very, very fast paced environment."
good,It was a well paying job but there was some favoritism to lifelong Delta employees verses those who got on through mergers or hired from other airlines.
good,"Large Airline with many opportunities.  Ability to move between departments and divisions.  Strong culture of promotion from within, allowing an individual to move from an entry level position to supervision and management.  Focus on Customer Service"
good,I loved the company. I would love to work for this company. I learned a lot for teammates. Fair but firm company. All customers were treated as family as well as workers.
good,"I love the environment, also my co workers!!! Couldn't imagine working anywhere else. An the benefits are absolutely amazing!!! I've only had issues when I was contracted out."
good,"Loaded and unloaded aircrafts "
good,"It was a great school for me. Other managers were able to provide  me great tools for development. Delta is a good place to work, their policies with its employees are pretty fair. The difference is made by the manager you have."
good,"excellent working experience, everyday was a learning experience, good work culture,approachable and supportive management. there was no hardest part as such working with delta cause we worked as a team . i loved going to work .guess it was the family like team and work culture"
good,"Over 21 years I have met some of the greatest people that are willing to help and go that extra mile to help customers and each other.  Great plans going forward, lack of execution"
good,"My dad, step-dad, mom, and step-mom all worked at delta.  I was very excited to get a position within delta's corporate office.  I love the travel benefits and took advantage of flying every opportunity that I could.  Unfortunately, my position was cute when Delta merged with Northwest."
good,On time was a typical day! I had learned a great deal while at Delta Air Lines. I started out in Cabin Service and worked myself up to a lead position however each department is different so you were taught your duties in every department. Management was decent but like everywhere else racism played a role but it wasn't tolerated due to accountability and repercussions! The workplace culture was fair as long as you were a responsible worker. The hardest part of the job was if you worked in a department that worked outdoors especially around air crafts and heavy equipment you had to work also in the elements cautiously. The most enjoyable again is working in sunny good weather if you worked outside. Reservation and Air Logistics had it's challenges but benefits & traveling first class when available on vacation with family is a  beautiful reward!
good,"Delta is a good place to work overall. Its ramp operations are MUCH more organized than other carriers I have worked for, which helps them have a higher on-time rating and less bags go missing. On the customer service side, the passengers are usually nice but obviously sometimes can get very angry and take it out on you. However, there aren't nearly as many 'gotcha fees' as compared to other carriers, which gives passengers less reasons to complain. Company is very top heavy (huge mgt salaries compared to frontline workers) but promotion truly is almost entirely from former agents, which is good. Flight benefits are best in the industry (I have had benefits on 5 major carriers and Delta wins here esp due to int'l biz class for employees). Delta is a smart company and its ticket agents have quite a bit of authority to make decisions actually but management (as elsewhere) usually feels the need to make their mark, so to speak, every once in awhile to prove their importance. Nearly all employees will start as ready-reserve status for airport positions (basically part-time w/ no benefits, except flight benefits of course). This is excellent for traveling if you have money coming in elsewhere, but getting full-time status will take on average 3-5 years unless you are willing to relocate, get promoted, or both. Fun fact-to get promoted to supervisor (1st level real mgt) on the ramp or at the counter, you must have at least 1 year working both positions. Annoying to some, but surprisingly helpful to agents who have in fact worked both. Most stations let you bid on schedules by seniority"
good,"I was assigned great projects that enhance my skills on many levels. The team worked collaboratively and cared about family matters."
good,"Employees seem happy at Delta airlines and is a very relaxed environment from my experience. Flight benefits are a bonus. Its been a long time but back then I only had 2 weeks of PTO a year, which was the only con."
good,"Uma empresa boa que me serviu muito, de muita responsabilidade"
good,A typical day would be to sit and wait for phone calls to come in and then answer them and help the client on the other end of the phone with whatever the wanted from finding flights to checking arrive times and departures to helping with other needs
good,It was a good experience. I learn to be aware and be alert with searching the planes and be prompt and curious to passengers l believe this was a great experience from my behalf
good,"Delta's corporate office is demanding. Aviation is demanding. But if you want to fly around the world for virtually free, and not be a pilot, here is the place to be."
good,"This was a great place to work. I met so many people, which is what I miss most about my employment there. Employment with this Company has afforded me many opportunities that I would not have other wise had."
good,"The job is very physical but the rewards are worth it.  You meet a lot of interesting people, you receive great flight benefits, you work and meet amazing people who truly make the job worth it.  At times it can become extremely stressful, but overall it's one of my favorite places to work."
good,It was a very interesting job. I enjoyed working with Delta because it pays ok and you have good benefits. And hours and days are flexible as well. Good overall.
good,Great job to meet new people and help them get to where they're wanting to go. Meeting people from different cultures and parts of the world was very interesting.  Exciting job and being able to travel was worth being there.
good,"Guide aircrafts to assigned docking station during any and all-weather conditions."
good,Flight delays out of your control. Time is of the essences while keeping calm collect and resourceful. Employees will be treated fairly. May need to learn not to take everything personal.
good,It's a great place to work. You can meet a lot of different people. I love working there. But the manager is not a very understandable person she doesn't make the job worth keeping.
good,"I loved working at Delta airlines, if given the chance i would do it all over again & again!"
good,"Executava trabalhos de limpeza e conservação em geral."
good,"Delta Is A Great Company To Work For, Beautiful Benefits for A Young Person. If you love traveling and seeing the world Delta is to place to apply, Just put in the work everyday at the job and you will enjoy every benefit."
good,"If you like being gone half of your month someone where around the world this is your job!! I enjoyed being a flight attendant for Northwest Airlines now Delta very much. I had a life change that caused me to leave, but I would LOVE to be back in the friendly sky's!"
good,"My major job was to install a new reservation system  and network"
good,Great company to work for and i. Would be a great asset being ive worked in this industry for over 22 years. Im ready for any new challenges that delta may have for me
good,Pay is excellent once you've been there for a while....never had a problem with managers when a personal issue arose...they always worked with me and my schedule.
good,"The work place culture is excellent. Delta is not just a job it is a family of pride. It has great flight benefits, 401K matching program and other discounts.  Compensation it one of the best in the industry"
good,"Enjoyed almost 30 yrs there.  However, the tendency is to hire and promote quickly those just out of college.  These people do not have the knowledge of the industry that old timers do nor the people skills."
good,I enjoyed working with the many employees on my team at Delta Airlines. They were willing to take me under their wing and teach me how to do so many things. They helped me tremendously in the learning process and accelerated my learning process.
good,"Contribute a lot to my personal growth "
good,"It's quite a straight forward job, saying that as a customer service agent (other positions may be more complex or require more professional experience. Definitely a great company to work for, management is really understanding and efficient."
good,It the ultimate job for a professional pilot.  Spent 30 years at Northwest / Delta.  Left only because of my age.  I love flying and interacting with passengers and co-workers.
good,"Flexible job, work life balance and available in multiple cities. Speaking to people calling for an assortment of flight and travel related questions from an assortment of airlines can be challenging but the reward is totally worth it."
good,"The company isn't that bad. 6 billion dollar company, you'd think you'd pay the employee more than $13hr. You make 17 million a year but can't increase the people that help you get there by at least $2."
good,"Stay focused on your on personal career path and avoid all other distractions. I personally love working for Delta. I will admit that I've had personal challenges that the actual airport stations weren't so great at assisting or accommodating me, but once I reached out to Corporate, the response was swift and great."
good,Awesome and fun environment. Always room for growth. Great benefits. Leadership is understanding and supports team to ensure happiness and satisfaction
good,"Great company to work for, amazing opportunity. Amazing to work outside when the weather is nice and also interesting to work when it is a bad storm. Working around air planes is interesting and always room to learn new things. Great to know people depending on you and you depending on them for them to see what you don't  see to help you be safe. The hardest part of the job is actually none that I'm able to think of. Traveling is the most enjoyable part."
good,"Overall an enjoyable place to work. Delta operates at a fast pace so be prepared to carry your weight."
good,This is a great company to work for. It is one of the best airlines as well. It is great. I love it. Fun environment. Very family oriented. Very open to helping other. Very good at helping with advancing.
good,I enjoyed my time at Delta people are great and  they work in a team environment.  Passengers are annoying at times when the situation isn't ideal but overall I throughly enjoyed my time at Delta
good,"I have spend 10 years in this company I enjoyed traveling around the world me in my family. Do not give your buddy pass to No One!;-) if you do, the price you pay is unbearable."
good,"This is an excellent organization. They take pride in their brand and their employees, and use available resources to develop and maintain top of the line leadership."
good,Opportunities were many for growth and personal development.  May require relocation to achieve some of these goals. Provided world wide travel for minimal cost.  Staff was very diversified and provided a  look into other cultures and ways of life.  Was a very rewarding experience.
good,The ppl were great and the management was awesome. If i could go back I would only if the pay was better. The benefits was great and being that you work for an airline you get to fly free.
good,"I learned about customer service and relations with all types of people of different races, backgrounds, and skill sets."
good,"Great job to look for if you're looking for something hands on and fun.  Delta is also a caring company that offers the employee, and its dependents access to unlimited flight benefits to anywhere Delta flies."
good,No micro-managing here. Management trusts employees to get the job done. Employees have a helping attitude across department lines.
good,"It's very good company to work for.flying benefits are great ,good pay .hours are great .management could be much better."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew.
good,"Delta airlines is an amazing company. No day is ever the same. My job includes checking passengers in and board flights. I have met some amazing people I call friends that make working for Delta very enjoyable. I have learned all the in and outs about flying and the pressure that gate agents face. There is a lot of pressure to get flights out on time and its the days when its my turn to fly to a new city, I  am grateful and happy to say I work for Delta airlines."
good,"Leadership team demonstrate excellent interpersonal skills. They show their appreciation for the hard work the employees do everyday. Great reward programs, Very supportive leadership team"

good,This job will keep you in shape. You can chose your shift and time frame to go with your lifestyle. You get flight benefits too.
good,"Load and unload freight, luggage, push out planes in a timely manner. Learned great customer service skills and communication skills, decent management, diverse employees, the hardest part of this job is the physical part for some people, and the most enjoyable part of the job is the flight benefits."
good,Being a ramp agent means loading and off-loading luggage on and off of airplanes. You are definitely going to meet some interesting people on a day to day basis.
good,"Over the 22 years spent at Northwest Airlines, the career path that was followed was very rewarding, fulfilling, and created many solid, long term friendships."
good,Best job ever!  People ask me now what do I want to do......I have no idea.  I already had the perfect job!
good,"Management was scattered. To many people in charge and not enough people who knew what was going on."
good,"Long day at work"
good,"Best job you could have. Work day was getting planes out on time and resolving customer issues. Advanced management skills, Co-workers were excellent, hardest part of job was security after 9/11, co-workers were great."
good,"I was able to transfer to serveral department to learn the overall scope of the company and how each section impacted the customer expereince, The flight benefits are the best perk one can have. It gives one the stress relief of getting far away from work to enjoy your family in a different setting."
good,Absolutely loved working for this company!  Delta is still by far the BEST company I have ever worked for!  Would love to return to the Delta family!  GREAT company... nothing negative from me.
good,"I love Delta Airlines, I wish I could move up within the company faster. The airline industry goes by senority for the most part and for some people it takes forever to move up unless you are willing to move. I am willing to move and have a bachelor's degree but havent had an opportunity to move up. Your typical work day depends where you work, ramp, ticket counter or the gates. The gates is my favorite part of the job because its fast pace, challenging and you have a lot to do."
good,"I love the work and the company.  It's challenging because every day is different, and I love that about it.  Management is supportive and attentive.  Co-workers are great.  I work in a small area with little turn over,.  We've worked together forever.  he hardest part of the job is that there is no opportunity for the type of career development I seek.  What I like most is the travel."
good,esta empresa tem um compromisso bom com seus funcionarios e fornecedores .

good,I had a great time working for delta airlines in new york.I met different people and it was interesting.
good,I really enjoyed my time at NWA. I got to see the world and the United States in a new light. The work was hard and the training and scheduling were brutal but it was the best job of my life
good,Very big company and always room for advancement. great company
good,Long as you handle what you are suppose to then there is no problems
good,I worked for Delta Airlines in Tampa for a little over ten years. The management team was fair to me. I was a single parent with an asthmatic child and they were very caring about my parental situation. It was a pleasure working with my peers and management team.. Respect was the order of the day for me. I gave respect and was given respect. It was a pleasure working with the customers and i was given a chance to go above and beyond with my customers.
good,great company to work good thing to travel all around the world
good,"I love my job, its a great place to work everyone is helpful & friendly."
good,"I am very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work for such an incredible airline such as Delta Airlines. The company's style of service is that of a high professionally oriented standard but also a lighthearted atmosphere in which one would find not only many happy employees but passengers as well. Every flight attendant is required to successfully complete 6 weeks of FAA mandated training in their state of the art aerospace aviation facility in Atlanta. This is when each flight attendant becomes certified in fields such as CPR, First aid, HAZMAT, Combative Self-Defense, Crew Resource Management, and Aerospace Aviation Emergency Training. Upon completion, the real fun began. Traveling to distant places such as Africa, India, Germany, Russia, England, Ireland, and all over The United States of America while working with and meeting some of the most interesting people along the way. I can honestly say I loved this job and if I had the opportunity to work for this company again I wouldn't even think twice!"
good,Loved the job and the People great pay and unbelievable benefits.
good,"My attributes include reliability, flexibility, and eagerness to learn. Each time I am presented with a new situation I assert my full attention. I enjoy my job."
good,Very fulfilling with opportunities to work with good people on interesting technical projects. The IT focus is very software dependent as it should be during this era.
good,Working at Delta Air Lines has been great but challenging.  I say challenging because you have a group of people whom has been at the company for years and no one holds each other accountable.
good,Team members work well together.  It was a great atmosphere.  The team members in Atlanta and Philadelphia will help one another to make the mission go forward.
good,"I averaged about 60,000 to 70 ,000 With overtime. I always gave 110% on any area I worked In. I always wanted to Leave In A Way I could Always Come Back."
good,I have been working for Delta Airlines as a contractor for more than two years now. Its great place to work. Work place culture is great and got to learn a lot in past 2+ years.
good,"Good experience working in delta airlines, good work culture and environment, glad to be an employee of the company. Would like to get back if i get a chance to work again."
good,"văn hóa đoàn kết, hỗ trợ giúp đỡ nhau"
good,Loved my coworkers but the pay couldve been better for the stress and my supervisor def played favorites. She refused to investigate a situation that happened
good,Be ready to work and work hard. Laziness isn't taken lightly with co-workers as it creates more work for everyone else. Enjoy the work and benefits...
good,Delta air lines is a great company to work with. Great work environment. great management. I have worked here for 4 years as a contractor without any hassles.
good,"Communicate and coordinate with crew members for preflight safety checks of the aircraft.Greet and assist customers.Provide help to passengers with special needs (children, disabled persons, elders etc).Present emergency equipment and give instructions to passengers on how to use this equipment.Prepare and serve drinks and food to passengers. Handle customer complaints in a calm and professional manner.Assist passengers and cabin crew during emergency situations.Prepare and submit reports on flight incidents."
good,"Great experience and great benefits. You get what you put into your experience. The hardest part is the training, take it seriously. Clients overall are pleasant."
good,"Delta was a summer program for college students who parents worked there. The time I worked there it was a fast-paced job. I didn't have any benefits because I was only working there for the summer for the program. Overall, it was a great experience."
good,"Working at Delta is a huge privilege and the benefits given are awesome as well. A regular workday can be challenging but very rewarding. There are opportunities to grow and learn. Also, it's a job that keeps you busy and on your feet."
good,"Weekly events"
good,Only issue is in sju where it’s all a tight knit group with a specific agent that gets away with everything . And MANAGMENT and Human Resources . Michael Luciano and Ingrid Hogan
good,Everyone is very professional and friendly. The company culture is taken very seriously. They are very meticulous when it comes to work-ethic and results. Communication is a big deal at Delta for it is a large campus with many different divisions work simultaneously and must meet deadlines at the same time on certain projects.
good,"Fun job, met great people, and got to see the world. However, it was hard to balance work and life commitments. I couldn't plan on making a concert with friends or events too far in advance due to the scheduling process."
good,"Expectations were as high of level as the military, but much better pay, and no combat. Got to work with aircraft everyday, and at times I was able to do things I never thought possible."
good,Good job and you get to fly for free and your family. It's a place where you can meet alot of people and learn alot about airplane and the way it works
good,Great place to work and great work family. Great support staff. Treated like a family environment. Great benefits including the flying. Training is very easy to catch onto
good,"I loved working for Delta, it was a great opportunity. "
good,"Working many different kinds of hours, weekends, and holidays. Always showing a professional and curteous demeanor. Helpful in all situations, including safety realted emergencies. The job demanded ontime and reliable attendance. Working as a team was essential in getting everything done in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job was the jetlag."
good,Delta is a great place to work because hourly workers have the ability to swap shifts as much as they want and we get to participate in profit sharing
good,Working here will be a great expreince. You will be able to travel all around the world. There are many great perks to this job but there are a lot of down falls to this job. Its very fast pace especially during the summer time.
good,"High paced environment with very interesting people to share it with!! The benefits are worth the stressful environments, not to mention the flight benefits."
good,"Focus on the company and your individual experience while employed there"
good,"I enjoy interacting with passengers, some flying for the very first time. Sometimes just a simple, sincere smile can make a person's day better."
good,"Best job I've had. Had to leave due to only being able to work as a part-timer but other then that, the company is great and the benefits are great. I would love to work there upon my retirement"
good,"Pay is not great, good for flying benefits, make sure you have a second/primary job, employees are the most dedicated hard working people you will ever come across"
good,We took good care of all the employee's of Delta fitting them with the New uniforms that was two years traveling to all the united states base.  We have a good time with all the employees and their likes and dislike.  We had to make sure they all fitted the uniforms with great care and with a lot of laugh's and they were very proud.  With our service and getting to know them.  I would love to work for the company some day.
good,Delta is a great company where you can easily advance as long as your responsible. The overall benefit is great. We have travel privileges. You get along with majority of the other agents.
good,"Worked as a contractor for one year. although no benefits, still a very rewarding experience. Their love and passion for hard work as well as family stood out and was greatly appreciated."
good,"Most days I move luggage for Point A to B"
good,pretty fun place to work get to meet different people from different culture and country. I just loved working at delta but my time there had ended due to a family emergency
good,"Great place to work. It created a good work life balance, management wasn't so great but was fair. It was a good learning experience for me and would definitely do it again."
good,"Learned proper aircraft maintenance  maneuvers while working with a great team of people to accomplish everyday task. Pay is great, benefits are awesome, management is top notch, and i loved going to the job every day"
good,"One of the benefits of the airline industry is being able to fly anywhere the airline goes, and most other airlines.also Delta does a very good job with training"
good,Excellent place to work with great benefits and opportunity to take charge of different projects. The work is extremely self guided and managers will listen to you and implement your ideas.
good,"My career wih delta was nothing short of wonderful. I’ve grown and matured along the course of my time there, and have acquired numerous talents that can be used interchangeably throughout any career field I decide to change to."
good,the best company to work for.I have on other two different places but  delta was exception.They have better safety rules and they  recognise their empoyer .
good,Delta is a very good company to work for. Pay is in line with the area and travel benefits are great offering traveling to anywhere in the country.  The culture is very friendly and family oriented
good,"Delta is great. Delta Global services, not so much. It had its pros and cons but more pros than cons. I would go back if I could. Not too many complaints."
good,"Excellent for those who love to travel, which I really miss. Most Delta agents throughout the network will lookout for you if you can't make a flight, but sometimes those flights are simply to full. Most folks I know would rather retire from Delta. You can do well for yourself as long as you show up for work and put in a hard days work, you will totally be fine. I really miss this company and I still go out of way to showcase the company as if I was still apart of the family."
good,"The work culture at this company is excellent and fun. The hours are convenient with enough time for yourself an employee. In addition, there is very easy to exercise your off-time privilege."
good,"I was able to work every customer service position here. I loved my co workers and was fortunate enough to have traveled so many places while working for Delta! An absolutely amazing experience. Sometimes it was very fast paced and there were some irate customers to deal with, but overall I’d do it all over if I could."
good,Great place to work. Great benefits. People help you out when needed. Highly recommend Delta as a place you should work for. Delta takes care of their people.
good,"Only worked with Delta on a temporary basis, but when I'm working with them I see how much they care for their workers.  They created a runway and decked out fitting for their employees so they could feel welcomed and valued while picking out their new uniforms. I have not heard of any other company ever caring that much. "
good,I had a ball while working for Delta. I would work their parttime but do not want work in Atlanta. Loved the Flight Benefits and stock options now changed over to cash options that I did not care for. When I work there no bonus plan. there is now should be big plus.
good,"it's very good place to work, good culture base, with both managerial and it supervisory role. A typical day work is very competitive, well organized and very of resources or reserves .There's nothing hard part of the job, everything is professional ,they are well trained workers that enjoys every part of the operation at my time of services.my enjoyable part of the job is multi tasking, team work that execute orders from start the end delivery."
good,Great company to work with. Will be sent for training at United States of America. Flexible lunch hour and free parking inside building. A lot of benefits included.
good,"I loved this job, management though in SAT.... terrible with the exception of V. Nava! A lot of backstabbing & Petty drama from all of the older agents there that get away with murder. If you’re not a favorite, you’re on the chopping block!"
good,"write Tableau reports, assist with testing the applications and data. I learned quite a lot about the reservation applications and was not micro managed. Since I enjoyed working with data I enjoyed working with the applications data"
good,"Thoroughly enjoy my time at Delta. They demand hard work at a pretty fast pace without sacrificing accuracy and quality. They put the customer first often but don't shy away from standing up for their employees. To climb the ladder you are practically waiting on people to die above you though, which says good things about working at Delta a long time."
good,A typical day is enjoyable workplace culture. The most enjoyable part of the day is the whole day. You are always learning something new.The hardest part of the job was training and learning new programs.
good,"I believe that my job as a Skyclub Ambassador for Delta is the best job at the Indianapolis Airport. Not only do I get to meet a lot of interesting people but I also get a chance to talk to them about their travel experiences and everyday life. My job can be laid back but also stressful on bad weather days. Since the Skyclub is the smallest department, my co workers and I are very close and have built friendships that go beyond our daily interactions at work"
good,"Yeager Airport is a smaller airport so the workload wasn't as much as Atlanta's, but it was still hard work usually with a short staff. Management was good, they just had no support from higher ups. The pay was also not worth the job, my feet would sometime turn purple during the winter, and heat strokes were a daily risk in the summer. It wasn't until West Virginia raised minimum raise that I was bumped up to 8.75."
good,"I worked for 23 years at Northwest Airlines, which was bought out by Delta. I had to retire early due to a health condition or I have no doubt I would still be there."
good,"The job is great, but shifts are terrible. Hardly any morning shifts unless seniority is high. EVERYTHING is based off seniority. Hard to get vacation if someone with a higher seniority request those exact same dates, I missed a family cruise because of it . This is my only complaint, the job itself is amazing ."
good,"This is my first airline job and I intend to retire from Delta. They offer great benefits, great pay and a great place to work. I am an ASM (Aircraft Support Mechanic) now and intend on getting my A&P license soon and moving to an AMT (Aviation Maintenance Technician) position."
good,"Great Company to work for, and very diverse. Awesome benefits as well. I have been with the company 5 years, and moved around to 4 position because I was eager to learn more."
good,"Work was spent taking incoming calls to assist customers with anything and everything to have to do with their flight, and flight itinerary. if you are thinking of working for this company you better enjoy computer work and be very good with self time managment."
good,Amazing company - limited on advancement opportunities. Very customer centric and always look forward to providing the Delta Difference. Benefits are amazing!
good,Great place to work. Management is very supportive. The Boston station is growing and providing additional growth and advancement. I would recommend working for Delta Air Lines
good,"Rigid schedule that allows you to switch every 3 months. I would highly recommend for anyone who doesn't mind having a fluctuating schedule and possibly giving their nights weekends and holidays. Other than that Delta is a great place to work. I love the people, the atmosphere and the perks."
good,If you are hired on PT you only work 5 hr days so you still have a lot of time for the rest of your day. The company lets you swap shifts with your coworkers meaning you could make your own schedule LITERALY. Management is very reliable and easy to find and get a hold of.
good,"We worked hard most days, but found a way to have fun on other days.  Its a very big network that needs an upgrade but that just means lots of positions that need to be filled.  Good and hard workers will enjoy working in this environment.  Must say there are some very stressful days as well."
good,"Enjoyed working for the Airlines. Great opportunities to learn about the airline and how they operate. Worked closely with change mgmt., first and second level support."
good,"Great office, casual attire required, tons of incentives. You have to be well with accepting change, nothing stays consistent. 4 calls a month are monitor randomly and customer surveys are priority."
good,"Delta was Amazing , Being able to Travel and work with an amazing team was exceptional. They were able to work with my schedule and I had a complete 8 hour shift and 40 hours a week. The hardest part about the job was the unexpected events , you never  know when there will be an outage or a natural disaster."
good,"I have enjoyed my 26 years at Delta,   i have worked in the Inflight area which is with Flight Attendants who have unique scheduling opportunities,    Support the Corporate as main position but located in one of the top bases where the needs are high each and every day."
good,"I loved working at the big D.  Lots of options to relocate, advance, or change department.  In the departments I have worked (3), I did not have a union, including as a flight attendant.  It has its pros and cons: lazy people get to go, however you have no job security.  Changes happen every day, you must be flexible and informed.  Loved the culture, the people, and our customers."
good,"Excellent company to be a part of. Management or co-workers on a day to day basis is just like any other job. Other than that, the work itself is excellent."
good,"It was fun and was able to see the work.  Management is not something you deal with very often.  once a year maybe.   If you like a job that is repeatative but if also different every flight (customers, situations, flight interruptions, crew, etc)  Very flexible to make your own schedule.  Work 10 days have 2 weeks off, etc. Control on what you make (work more, make more)"
good,"Great people to work with, fun environment, great flight benefits. You will really enjoy this company. The pay is very competitive. All locations through the system is great with Delta. But if you had to choose go to a hub."
good,The general culture is that people work hard and appreciate/expect  good work.  The company is profitable because everyone does their job and does it well.  Since the 1990's the Delta culture has shifted to a focus on profitability with the downside that no one's job is guaranteed.  Many good employees have been laid off or forced into early retirement over the last 20 years.
good,"A Delta era uma empresa ótima, e correta c/ o porteiro."
good,If you don't have a family or roots this is an incredible job. It can take you away for very long stretches and you will miss out on life events but if you are flexible it's perfect.
good,"I had enjoyed my experience at Delta airlines, the Job was fairly simple . I met great people and It was an easy honest living . I enjoyed the flight benefits."
good,Delta is an awesome company to work for but they will not back you and will fire you no matter your years of service and dedication to them.  They have great benefits and perks.
good,I worked for Delta Airlines for 28 years and it was a wonderful company to spend a career. I worked mostly dayshift 06:00 to 15:30. Lots of support from co-workers

good,"I learned a lot about what it takes to build an airport. As a Resident Project Representative, I was virtually left alone to take care of the quality of the day to day construction operations."
good,Set up aircraft load paperwork; met inbound aircraft; loaded aircraft with heavy eqipment; loaded per specific aircraft type paperwork; dispatched timely
good,"Great place to work. Great flexibility. Great opportunities await you at Delta. The hardest part of the job would probably be being away from home for periods of time, but you definitely get used to it!"
good,I applied for a job at Delta when I was in college because I wanted to fly to Atlanta for an interview.  It's been over 28 years and I have enjoyed every moment of my time here.  There are lots of opportunities for advancement in Atlanta or the other hubs.
good,"Nice work environment."

good,"Great Place to Work, goods benefits, meet and work with very interesting people all around the "
good,Delta is a company that really cares about its employees and shows it every way it can.  It has amazing benefits.  Committed to safety of all employees and passengers.
good,flt delays can sometimes back up late baggage /bad weather /but other days its a fun day seeing that we get our fls out on time.
good,"Good work environment.  Decent benefits.  The Delta/Northwest merge was a big change in the Delta culture.  To much Senior Management was form Northwest and not from Delta.  This caused some unrest with Delta people. Overall, things were worked out and business moved on."
good,I did several jobs with Delta and loved everyone of them but the one I loved the most was the last one (Load Planner). I enjoyed the job itself it offered just enough challenges to keep it from being monotonous. I liked working with the other departments and felt a sense of accomplishments when problems were solved and a flight was able to depart and land safely with the great team work Delta inspires and encourages. I miss the co-workers and management we had a good camaraderie and trusted each other to pass our knowledge onto each other and help when it was needed. I do miss working for Delta but the early retirement package was offered at a time I needed to spend with my family.
good,"A very fun place to work with the diversity of people and duties."
good,great place to look for jobs. good people and you get to travel and meet awesome people. working on the plane is phenominal  working an an environment with amazing co workers.

good,Company values and takes very good care of their employees. Great benefits and perks for employees. Very low stress work environment.
good,"I have been with Delta airlines for over 14 years, I must say I have no complaints about Delta. It is a Fun place to work, but can get stressful, as with any job, but what makes it special is the people that you work with."
good,Great job for young person needing to learn about time management and punctuality....no advancement moved on to open own business
good,A typical work day included interacting with various customers to ensure proper and safe booking and travels throught out the Us. I managed 26 employees during my time there.  The hardest part of the job was leaving.  The most enjoyable part was interacting with people from all sorts of backgrounds and demogrpahics.

good,"A typical work day consist of loading and off loading planes"
good,"A typical day of work consisted of answering inbound telephone calls in a call center environment regarding live animals, human remains, international and domestic freight as well as general inquiries. In my time with Delta, I learned to be comfortable and settle into the business providing exemplary customer service. The management was consistent, considerate and knowledgeable. My co-workers were incredible in their assistance of customers, as well as one another, with their kind, professional demeanor. The hardest part of the job was answering inquiries regarding live animals. Not that it was unpleasant, but it was the largest volume of calls and the information changed or varied constantly which sometimes made it difficult to keep up with. The most enjoyable part of the job was the camaraderie between customer service representatives and management, including upper management - there always seemed to be plenty of smiling faces and enjoyable connections."
good,"A typical day with Northwest Airlines would be fly to where training would be needed, prepare training materials for the students. Teach 8 hours to my peers of Airline policies and procedures."
good,I have been in the airline business for over 26 years. I have had alot fun and so many wonderful people all over the US. A typical day is never the same. Little things can happen but I still have a job to keep everyone and everything safe. Safety is the first and last thing we think about every day at work. My co-workers are really great. We treat everyone like there our family. The hardest part is when someone has missed a flight and they might have no way to make it home in time before someone might pass away. The most enjoyable part is helping passengers get some where they need tobe be whether its a important business meeting or getting somebody home in time for a father or mother to see there child play in a special event or be at a birthday party.
good,Love to work for this international company. Enables a person to travel the world!
good,A typical day at work is quite fun and stress-less.  DGS is a great place to utlize your skill set and to add input to the operations of the division.  Co-Workers help each other and work at a steady pace.
good,overall a great company to work for the benefits packages are top notch the management team is great they have a family culture where friendships can be created. coworkers are very good very personable and knowledgeable
good,Delta is a great company to work for and family is important. They show support and advancement can be an option. However second chances are not always an option so be careful.

I was just requested to take the opportunity to find another job just in case, I don't qualify for the ""Accommodation Assistance Program"" that is being offered to employees with impairment.  To tell you about my work:"
good,I would have never left if there were openings in my station for full time.
good,I love my job. I love the ability to help people get to their final destination. I learn about different cultues and how they live. Hardest part is not being able to get them out when a flight arrives late.
good,I do love my job I deal with passengers which I love my days are different everyday no two days are alike a regular day at work would be check passengers documents check in their bags a nd give them a boarding pass.
good,"Once you work for an airline, it sort of stays in your blood. Its the type of place where every single day is different. You meet so many wonderful people. Your co-workers are like family. You all work together in reaching one goal and that is to get customers to their final destination in a safe, comfortable, hassle free environment. The flying benefits are fantastic. I truly miss this job. This is a career where I would have loved to stay if the pay was a little better."

good,"Delta is a great company to work for and a very fast-paced environment. I have been very fortunate to have worked in a wide range of areas in Reservations, however, they are closing the Seattle office this fall so I am trying to find a career as rewarding as Delta in Seattle vs. having to relocate to Headquarters in ATL. I would prefer staying in management and love HR/Labor Relations/Operations."
good,"Fast pace job that requires being alert at all times. Loading and unloading aircraft, parking and push back of aircraft, air starts and servicing of aircraft. Hooking up belt loaders for luggage removal and cargo and freight. Constantly in contact with management with hand radio and computer entries of aircraft arrivals and departures. Data entries of luggage and freight counts, and weight and balance before departure. All aspects of the job was very enjoyable. Coworkers were fantastic to work with. Just like one big family. Great TEAM WORK. The hardest part of the job was trying not to smile. I enjoyed every bit of the job. I learned how to service different aircraft, and to operate several different machinery. When dealing with the passengers, customer service is always with a smile."
good,I learned alot from this comapny. Excellent company to work for. it does not exist in jackson anymore.
good,"The company had great benefits, health insurance, 401K & flight benefits."
good,during that year 2006 airlines were just starting to consolidate so it was time to retire
good,"People often complain about how difficult it is to get hired with Delta.  It's for good reason.  They really are the best of the best.

good,Delta is an amazing company. They really do care about us an individuals and they do they best to take care of us. As a ready reserve it is a lot harder to be financially stable since you can only work a fixed amount of hours per a year. But the company compensate us greatly through 401K matching and flight benefits.
good,Great job in a great atmosphere. Endless opportunities for advancement and great opportunity to travel the world and get paid great while doing so. Seniority based company

good,"It's up to the individual. I cannot complain. The company itself is a ladder climbing company. Pay is fair. Being employed at the airports you have options such as ready reserve program, part-time and full time. I almost forgot seasonal is an option. The best benefit is being able to have the flight benefits."

I just wish I had started earlier in life"

I learned airports have roads or streets and driving equipment called tugs. I didn't much care for the rotating shifts but it was cool. If I was too ever move back that way I would apply they're again."
good,A typical day at work involved wing walking planes in and out of the determined gates. Loaded baggage into the bins of planes. I worked with ground and flight crews to make sure each plane departed on time. I learned how to manage stress. The hardest part about the job are the environmental conditions.
good,"During my internship at Delta Airlines Inc. I have learned a lot of administration tasks. My job is similar to a secretary of the employer. I've learned the simple tasks of scanning, printing, and photocopying of documents. Organizing files and encoding important contact information to the database. Preparing reports and analyzing data and availability of flights. Answering outside calls and achieving tasks that are planned for the day. I've learned that all departments are coordinating with each other to finish the tasks on time. The culture comes with the people who works hard and dedicates their life to achieve goals and success as well as representing the company. The hardest part of the job is when you are just starting to learn new things but as you go along it is very much easier to be right on track. The most enjoyable part of the job is with the people you are working with as a team."
good,"I enjoyed my time there.  Being a flight attendant, you travel the world and have the opportunity to learn about different cultures.  You also get to learn about different foods."

good,Great company with great flight benefits. It would be much better if the company would adopt to hire full time employees and insure they have employees loyalty.
good,I am currently a seasonal employee at Delta Airlines and I enjoy the role I play in the company. I personally feel as if all employees are one giant family. I  gained a great deal of experience and I feel as if this was an amazing stepping stone for me.
good,"Delta is one of the top rated airlines in the world.  I am very grateful to be part of this wonderful company.  Besides all the benefits we have, one of the core benefits all employees have are we travel for free wherever Delta flies and 401K payout."
good,"Out of all the jobs I've had this had to be the best. Yes, it does get stressful at times but you just have to know how to handle it. If you don't this isn't the job for you. You have to be ready for anything think on your feet and learn how to handle stressful situation and maintain constant professionalism. I love the work and the people. The station I worked for was multi cultural which was great. If they would hire me back I would go back in a heartbeat."
good,"Being employed with Delta was the BEST employment I have ever encountered.  I met new people everyday, enjoyed my fellow co-workers and the environment.  It was a new experience to deal with aircrafts.  You learn something new everyday and it is always busy ( in a good way) so that the day progresses quickly.  I wish that I could have maintained my position at Delta and I am diligently trying to regain employment.  The benefits are great!  I had never received a stock raise check from an employer before Delta.  They take care of their employees and constantly exhibit employee appreciation."
good,Excellent Airline to work for.  Once on board you become a Family.   Many different cultures working together.  A diverse airline.  Excellent perks along with free travel on Airlines.
good,The typical work day at Delta can consist of a family oriented work day.  This can consist of working together on critical issues and resolving the problem.  The management at Delta was fair and ever changing....but some job advancement was slow.
good,"Be on time, Help the Customers, Show professionalism. "
good,"I am having to find FT work and this position is only PT. However, it is an amazing environment with amazing flexibility and management. I LOVE LOVE LOVE my position here! Very diverse work environment and a great team effort to make things run as needed!"
good,"Early morning meeting before shift started morning breakfast since we were in so early(3:00 am).

good,"I used to Manage the team and involved in Technical as well as development,Good place to work and learn.Management is always in favour of employee.Enjoyed the job."
good,It is a great place to work. Work culture is great. Team mates are also very helpful. Technical work is also challenging. Lagging on latest technologies.
good,"Hours are limited if your'e not full time. Other than that, the environment is great. The hardest part of the job is gathering equipment which prompts most people to come in earlier than their start times."
good,Working at Delta is like working with family.  They are always there to support you.  The benefits were very impressive.  I enjoyed traveling and had lots of opportunities to travel the world.

good,"The Company has great work/life balance."
good,"Started the work day out with a short group briefing.  You receive your assigned tasks/position for that day and then you head out. Most of the day is spent moving bags according to your task at hand and then you go home."
good,"Delta was a great company to work for and the benefits were amazing. The only negative thing that I can report for Delta is that the company is seniority based. It didn't matter that every review I received praised how hard I worked and that I did the work of 3 employees. When 9/11 happened, the cuts were made from the bottom of the seniority pool."
good,Love being in my position to meet new people and help them to their favorite destinations. Giving them a memorable experience is a vice of mine. Although some days are challenging I wouldn't change it for anyone. With the open door policy you could be talking to your CEO face to face at any given time

good,"Great company to work for but not flexible hours. Love the benefits. Fly free everyone in the US."
good,Delata is a good company. My day is enjoyable.. Management is good and work place is cordial. The hardest part of my job is when we have AOG-Aircraft on the ground. That is when we are expected to provide any required spare parts to get the aircraft off the ground.. The most enjoyable time is when we taken out to eat with a vender.
good,"This company is a great, fun and productive place to work. The pay is reduced to compensate for the flight benefits. The hours available to work is based off seniority, so if you do not have a flexible time to work then this would be a difficult job to have."
good,"I really enjoy working for Delta Air Lines, it is a Fortune 500 company with a home town feel. A typical day for me is I come in and get done what I need to while having very little micro management from my leaders. As long as I am performing well I feel safe with my job."

good,"Being a Flight Attendant is the most rewarding job ever!  It is constantly changing every single day.  The travel is amazing.  The most difficult part of the job is you are on your feet for up to 16 hours a day, you often work holidays, and you are away from your family.  BUT it is worth it.  I recommend it to anyone who loves people.  The only reason I am leaving is due to a foot injury that is taking a long time to heel.  Good luck!"

good,This job was amazing. It was very fun working with flyers and airplanes all the time. Had a lot of down time between flights but when you started working flights it was crunch time. Flights have departure times so you had to make sure you had everything planed and ready to go. Other then that I loved this job a lot it was one of my favorite jobs.
good,"Working at Delta Corporation / Delta Beverages was a great opportunity for my life. I will always cherish the years of  hard work and mentorship i spent at this great company.The experience i gained, no one can take away from me.

good,Northwest Airlines was a company that afforded the security of a workplace that allowed for advancement and was a progressive company during it's time.
good,This was a great company with great managers. All employees were team players and enjoyed coming to work. A fun place to work everyday.
good,"At Delta there was never a typical day, we would learn new things each and every day and for the most part management was good and concerned about  their employees. The thing I miss most are the coworkers and relationships we were able to form The hardest part of our job was the days where weather would cause unavoidable delays and the public just could not understand, so it took every ounce of your reserve to continue to smile and deliver the service that our company expected."
good,Excellent place to work with great advancement oppurtunities

good,"Angry customers. Desperate customers. Challenging customers. That pretty much described the typical day in the Baggage Service Office (Lost and Damaged baggage/luggage). No one walked into this office unless something was wrong. Occasionally we'd get people looking for the rest room, but mostly they came into the office to vent their frustrations."
good,"I never had a ""typical day"". Every day was always something different. I always worked with different co-workers and met new people. I'd say the hardest part of the job is being away from home for a long period of time and the long hours. A typical work day is usually 12-14 hours. But, what I enjoyed the most is meeting the new people and seeing new places."
good,This was a good company to learn new technologies. Teams and management were enjoyable to work with.
good,"Aprendi a trabalhar em parceria com outros empregados sem distinção de cargos, sempre colaborando uns com os outros."

For those who are so inclined, there is a wide range of opportunity between teams, including aircraft components, propulsion, repair process engineering, enabling technologies, avionics, liaison, fleet management, fleet reliability and fleet solutions. I have had the opportunity to work on three of these teams within my ten years at Delta, which has allowed me to get my hands on a wide range of projects across many of our fleets. The work is quite diverse and there are endless opportunities to grow. As an Air Force veteran, my transition to civilian life was made significantly less difficult by the opportunities Delta has given me. I am proud to be part of the Delta family and plan to be here for quite a while."

good,"Delta is the best of the best in the airline industry. The pay, benefits, and overall culture of the company is unmatched. As a new hire flight attendant, you get little say in your schedule/routes/hours, but that gets better as you gain seniority in the company. Excellent job for the young traveler. I would not recommend this job to someone looking to settle down or start a family as the schedule can be taxing and home-life is not a priority. I spent a great 6 months with the company and was able to leave on great terms."

Exceptional support from the company and fellow employees."

I was learned a lot and gain a lot from the Air Lines business, the management is very detail orient and treats everybody with respect. Our work culture there are very diverse and enjoy the work environment that we have.  The hardest part of the job was that when it comes to a project the manager just let you finish them on your own because each of us has a very broad knowledge about what we do and he recognized that, including every holiday the manager let us come home at half day and that was hard because I am very enjoy working there so it is hard to come at half day.  The most enjoyable there was that the Manager let you act and run the company there like your own and feels like no stress at all."

good,"Delta use to embrace employee relations however current management does not. It has become extremely cut throat over the years. Local managers lead with erratic leadership styles. They are not highly educated and lack solid leadership skills. Senior management have more finesse, education and leadership skills however have minimal awareness of the fox in charge of the chickens."
good,I'm the kind of person that knows how to handle difficult tasks.  We received an excessive amount of parts throughout our shop that need to be addressed differently.  One of the biggest challenges is reaching out to several people that must support your needs to solve a problem and them not being available at that moment.  I have learned to try and find issues that may arise early enough so deadlines are still met. The most enjoyable part of my job is the team I work with.

good,"Fabulous work colleagues and brilliant outer agencies to work with."
good,"Enjoyed the work culture "
good,Northwest Airlines was acquired by Delta Airlines after I left the organization.  The airline industry in general is an excellent place to work.  The wages after the first few years exceed most regional levels.  Balancing work and family is made easy with the ability to trade days if you need to or give away your work day completely.  Excellent insurance and of course the great travel benefit of working for an airline.
good,Interesting job meet new and intriguing people everyday. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy and hateful people who try to put that same hateful vibe on you as well.
good,"One of the BEST companies I have ever had the privilege of working for. Delta has the best insurance, and travel benefits in the industry. Yes, you might have gossip, and drama in the workplace, but all in all, management has your back."

good,"Very Productive, customers keep you on your toes, You learn to develop compassion for others, patience and mildness. My co-workers and I get along quite well. I try to make my job less stressful for myself and my co-workers. all thought some time its gets very busy at time I love my job, that's the time I enjoy the most. I am not a fan of when its slows down, and there is not too much to do, so I help my other co-workers with their assignments, or I find something to do."
good,there was a bag going to the wrong city with the passage med in it. So I was able to track the person down to make sure we had the right the city.
good,Great place to work.  The café is not so good.  The people are fun and very helpful.  I have learned a lot in the time I have been here.  There are so many area's you can work in with Delta and so much to learn.  A typical day at work is writing requirements.  My co-workers are great.
good,"Low pay, menial work, great flight benefits. Starts at 13/hour, same work every day its almost mind numbing. Some of the people are hard to work with but if you wanna travel the world its worth it."

good,"Some days area very busy and others are easy going and slow. Management are rarely seen but are readily available when and if needed. The hardest part of the job is working in the different climates.And the most enjoyable part of working for delta is being able to fly you and your anywhere delta flies for free, Overall a great company to work for."
good,I started striping aircraft pulling the paint off for repainting.Then I bided into Stores Dept. Where I started driving Trucks and move up to an 18 wheeler.Where I drove up close to the Aircraft and unloaded with a fork lift. Follow all Regulations and rules.
good,"Very active job it will keep you in shape. However, it's family orientated and very diverse. Ramp agent unloads & loads: bags, cargo, animals, and HR (human remains) you walk the planes in & out of the gate, communicate to the pilot and your ALA. bag handlers put bags in the correct tugs so they can get to the correct plane so ramp agents can unload them onto the plane."
good,It takes a lot of patience to be a flight attendant..Each day brings new challenges to this big Airlines..Always adapting to a new environment with people from all parts of the world.
good,"My responsibilities involved the running of  the operations tower for Delta Airline in Atlanta every day for 17 years, also included overseeing operation towers in other cities."

good,Delta is a great company and in my opinion the premier airline in the United States. I unfortunately left Delta in pursuit of more money however would go back in a heartbeat. Delta takes great care of its employees and provides a great benefit package as well once you reach either part time or full time status.
good,It was a easy and laidback job with good people who loved to do their job. This was the best job experience I have ever had at a job.
good,"A typical day at work would be taking incoming calls to assist customers with their travels, I've learned that I could assist so many customers in one day, I've had the best management team that I could ever be under. My co-workers were very helpful and caring individuals. The hardest part of my job was not being able to get customers to their final destination 3 or 4 days out due to bad weather. The best part of my job was listening to customers stories while assisting them with their travels."
good,"Everything but flying the planes. "
good,"Delta Air Lines was fast paced and challenging but a  great place to meet interesting people from all over the world.  Delta's mission was to provide exceptional customer service and therefore ensured that all employees attended workshops to enhance their customer service skills.  The station manager led by example.  He was positive, enthusiastic, energetic and he encouraged the employees to perform exceptionally well.  He constantly rewarded his employees for job well done.  Teamwork was a must in this fast paced industry and everyone worked together to accomplish goals.  The biggest challenge of the job was re-accommodating passengers when flights were cancelled or delayed.  What I enjoyed most was knowing we could depend on each other to get the job done in the most challenging times."
good,Delta is an outstanding company to work for they lead the industry with integrity and i wouldn't recommend flying anyone else.
good,"Great team of professionals from all background and experiences. Had the chance to travel around the world and learn about new cultures and backgrounds. Its hard to be away from home so often, but when you work with such diverse group of individuals it makes it all worth it. Had a great time at Delta."
good,I like the work i did its a good place to work at or for and growth is possible for anyone. the professional work place that delta show me is one that can be use for many job opportunity. i like working in a fast past a place were multitasking is a must so delta gave me that opportunity.
good,"A typical work day began with a briefing concerning any procedural changes.  The airline industry is an environment that is subject to constant change and you must remain flexible to respond to those quick changes.   Your computer, your telephone and your headset are the three most important tools you utilize.  Schedule flexibility was a definite plus, the ability to trade days or shifts allowed for better work-life balance.  Management embraced the overall mission statement of the company, therefore there has never been a need for unionizing.  When you interact with the general public, some customers can be difficult, but if you remember that this is not personal, keep a smile in your voice (because in a call center environment you don't have the luxury of eye contact), avoid using word ending in n't, (can't/don't).  Always think in terms of what you CAN do for the customer, and offer other travel alternatives, dates or times.  Delta Air Lines had the luxury of recruiting the best candidates, therefore I felt privileged to be a part of the Delta Family, and it was just that, A FAMILY.  Of course, the travel  to points all over the world was one of its greatest benefits."
good,"with my position I was required to develop concepts menus"
good,Any job is basically what you make of it unless the managers are just impossible.
good,Always something to do. Great benefits. Always talking to people and learning about the world.
good,Constant customer interaction...Meeting New people daily. Constant change Each day is different.
good,"Working in Flight Operations is working with a shifting target. Everyday there is something new to respond to "
good,"Delta Air Lines is a great place to work!!! When I am not in the office I spend time engaging with our customers.  My internal customer is the flight attendant group, but I like to receive 360 degree input when it comes to keeping Delta cutting edge. In addition, I also enjoy brainstorming sessions with my coworkers.  I would say the hardest part in the beginning of my managerial role was keeping my feet on the ground, but with my ever changing environment, my head remains in the clouds; finding out of the box ideas to keep us marketable."
good,"I am proud to be a part of Delta Airlines and wear the brand. Delta Airlines is the biggest airline in Atlanta, GA, and Atlanta's airport, Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, is the busiest airport in the world. It gets pretty busy on certain days and different seasons. I have more and more respect for ATC, and flight dispatch for how they manage traffic and the busiest airport in the world. Management is typically friendly for the most and gives you a feeling of importance and my co-workers are really easy to get along and distribute the workload and task evenly. We are a team and act as one as well. It is really easy to get hurt on this job as most jobs dealing with transportation and logistics but the people you work around with makes sure that ""you"" are more important than the machinery. Machines can be replaced and repaired, and you can not."
good,"I loved my co-workers; we all strived to make the job easier and more fun for each other. I loved my customers; even the angry ones were fun - my challenge was to turn them 180 degrees and make them happy. The management was supportive at all times and understanding when time off was essential. The job got tough when we were confronted with a flight delay or cancellation. These random hardships taught me how to deal with each and every passenger in a soothing yet efficient way, as if each was the only person with a problem. Again, with supportive peers and management, we were able to make the most of the most dire of situations. I LOVED this job."
good,Delta airlines Reservations office is a very great place to work. This place allows you to have and opportunity to meet new people as well as have opportunities to communicate over the phone interacting with customers.
good,"Open doors management environment , professional development"
good,"Disassembled / repaired and reassembled aircraft in Heavy Checks, Shop Component overhaul. I learned the various aspects of maintain aircraft. Our management team were very thorough co-workers were motivated fun people, the most enjoyable part of my job was when I moved back to Philadelphia and worked on live aircraft, trouble shooting, run/taxi and constantly learning."
good,"This company was great to work for with great people, management, and benefits. I really enjoyed the job and wish I still had it. It was very flexible and a happy place to work."
good,"Issue tickets for passengers, customer service, also received hands on training for reservations. Cleaned up inside the plane once it landed, restock, clean up ailes."
good,"The best job where you can manage your days off! Fun to work, constant flow of new people and places!"
good,"Northwest airlines was absolutely one of the best companies out there.  We were 45000 strong people that truly cared about our customers.   we worked shift hours 8 hrs paid lunch 5-1,6-2,....3-11,4-12 etc.    we had great training, good coworkers and it was difficult thru storms but we all had a common goal and made it work."
good,"A great company to work for. More than just co-workers, we are family."

good,"Each airline has it's own corporate culture and personality, This is a great one. I've been a consultant to many."
good,"As a supervisor, I arrived at 5:00 am and left at 2:00 pm. My individual responsibilities included producing a regional newsletter, occasional informational videos, and managing the Leadership Awards Program. Other duties typical of my work day might include conducting training, assisting with on-time departures of flights, monitoring or check-riding flight crews, coaching or re-directing unsatisfactory performance when needed, and maintaining data and files for performance reviews. I attended personnel meetings, professional development classes, and managers' meetings. When personnel came to me with questions or issues, I counseled them. I managed crisis, followed established procedures,  solved problems, and led by example."
good,"A typical work day was to report at least 10 minutes before my shift and prepare the office for opening. If working in the call center the same condition would apply so that I would be ready to handle my first incoming customer call. Working at Delta I gained alot knowledge as far as travel and customer service which was key.  Management was very hands on and was very helpful in the event a situation arose especially  personal. I am a team player and my co-workers were also like my family because of my years at Delta we became so close with weddings, births, deaths and even divorce. There wasn't really a hard part to my job, sometimes customers would be irate but still providing good customer service and resolving the problem was rewarding. Who knows they could have been having a bad day and would even admit it at times. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to travel and take my parents to different parts of the world where they would not have been able to see if it had not been for Delta Air Lines also meeting and making life long friends that I will forever have. We also had the flexibility of swapping with co-workers to extend our days off, which was very nice."
good,Words can't explain how great this company is. I still wish I worked for them. But it is an awesome place to work and a great company to work for.
good,Delta was a great place to work.  There was tons of flexibility in my job and the travel was awesome.  I wish i would have never retired from there.  I miss Delta.
good,To dress professional and meet and greet customer each day and to ensure the safety of our customer the hardest part of my job was not being able to help my customer. 
good,"Great company. Get a long with co-workers."
good,We usually have fun at work due being able to maximize our time the way we understand should be done at the same time of meeting our ontime and secure days of work. Interesting is when the K9 arrive and find something suspicious traveling.
good,"Safety was the number one priority of the company along with high standards, nice and friendly staff."
good,If you do not get stressed out with people in the public and their various personalities you would love this job. I love Delta first because of the company it is. Delta Leaders values the opinions of the people that make up the company.
good,loading and un loading caargo and bags. its was a fun a very productive enviorment. the best job i ever had
good,Handled high call volume. Spoke to thousands of passengers of diverse backgrounds. Loved talking to customers and help them with their travels. Dealt with irate passengers with ease. Enjoyed working at Delta Air Lines. The co-workers were a pleasure to work with.
good,I was ultimately laid off. Delta Airlines has since purchased Northwest. I was really good at my job and Loved it! The Syracuse station was closed.
good,Management was top quality. Always went out of their way to ensure you had everything you needed to complete the task. Willing to work schedule around school and family requirements. Co workers were the highest quality. Everyone has a job to do and they do it as well as they can. Cheap travel was a huge perk.
good,"I was a Supervisor in the International Operations Department, in charge of Inbound and Outbound flights, and assisitng customer passing thru Immigration and Customs"
good,I love the people I work with and the amazing benefits that Delta offers.
good,I reported to work two house before a scheduled flight takeoff. I reviewed the schedule and the service inventory.
good,"I suggest that anyone that can deal with the extensive application process GET A JOB HERE! The people you work with will become of your best friends. On the ramp level of the airport many of the zones have pingpong tables for the occasional downtime. You get extra pay for doing your job well and there are many ways to move around the company if you are proactive enough. Delta is very family oriented, some are even married to each other. Delta is truly a great company if you can get in. The two hardest things at Delta are getting hired and getting fired. Just do your job and you will be okay."
good,Resolve complains and find a solution for passengers change in travel plans voluntary or involutary.
good,Agradecido por la oportunidad de trabajo que tuve kn la empresa y x el excelente ambiente laboral
good,"In the airline industry,one didn't work a typical week.One could fly anywhere from a one day to an eight day trip, depending on if you were on call or had a normal schedule that you could bid for according to seniority. A typical day would involve seeing many people and serving them on the plane several times over.One may experience long waits in airports or the day could run smoothly.Flexibiliy is key in this career.The management at Northwest worked hand in hand with flight attendants and were mostly friendly and helpful.As any job, there sometimes may be a person that is not as friendly as the rest, but when flying with the same people for several days at a time, we generally got along very well and enjoyed our job. We made the best of even the most difficult situations and laughed our way from one part of the globe to the other,even when exhausted.The most difficult part of the airline industry,in particular,in flight crews, was the long hours. If a person commuted to get to their base, one could have been awake for 10 to 12 hours before beginning a 12 hour flight. The most wonderful part of the career was working with great employees, seeing many parts of the world and realizing how blessed we are in the United States as compared with many other countries. I loved meeting so many different people with different cultures and realizing that we are so alike in so many ways.Flying was my life, and I will always remember those great years."
good,Had an enjoyable team. Very productive and positive workplace.
good,Great shifts and co-workers. A lot of room for advancement.

good,"Delta is great company to work for. They treat you as part of the family its a fun easy going job. It is very exciting because no work day is the same. Delta has great benefits, one of the perks are unlimited flying to wherever the airline flies to free of charge for employees and family members of employee. It also has room for advancement."
good,It was a wonderful experience to have had the opportunity to work for this company. Great people and hard working and dedicated to accomplishing a wonderful travel experience for our passengers.
good,Provide information assistance regarding locations of airlines and any other airport information for over thousand travelers per day. Meet travelers at the curb to assist them with baggages. Handle baggage for travelers at transportation terminals. Perform highly sufficient crowd control and line directory. Maintain good customer service skills. Possess familiarity with the airport layout. Demonstrate problem-solving skill every time when individual questioning or challenging security employees regarding FAA and TSA regulations

good,"Working for Delta is an amazing stepping stone for opportunities, travel, flexibility and promotion. It is the best company I have ever worked for. The workplace culture is very exciting and positive and being around new people on a daily basis keeps the job interesting. The hardest part of the job is handling the stress of the passenger. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility, encountering new people every day, and travel!"
good,"They are really great and understanding. Some was not so, but others were. I had a lot of great training and experiences. Long days and hours,but worth it."

good,Delta is my favorite employer of all time.  Working for Delta allows me to expand my life experiences by meeting people from all over the world and immersing myself in other cultures.  I wish I would've started working here when I was younger.
good,"Pretty easy job"
good,My over all experience at Delta was very uplifting I would love to become a Delta employee once again the staff the management everything about Delta was beautiful
good,"Whether you're searching for a job to enjoy for a few years or the rest of your career, Delta is a great way to go! The company itself is so personable and they truly care about their employees and customers. The work/life balance can be a lot to get used to but it's well worth it! For anyone considering being a Flight Attendant, apply for Delta!"
good,"I've been with Delta now for almost 19 years and have moved around doing various positions.  The overall compensation is great! You get paid personal time/sick time, holidays to use, vacation 401l match up to 6% and Delta contributes to your 401k even if you don't. You also get health, dental, vision, life and disability insurance. Oh, and you get to fly free as standby, but you do have the option of buying a confirmed ticket with a 20^ discount."
good,"It's a great job if you either have little or no responsibilities/home ownership or can be away from home for 4 days at a time.  Good job for someone coming out of college and has a desire to do a little traveling! Or just wanting something new & very different. FA's are cliquish and it's a life style! It can be lots of fun at times, you'll miss home/family and can be very routine, not very challenging at times. For some, flying frequently takes it's toll on your health. Things to consider."
good,"Delta is a wonderful company to work for! I enjoyed my job and did it daily"
good,"I absolutely loved working for Delta Global Services. I got to see the caliber of company that I want to work for and that I eventually would like to have of my own. My coworkers enjoyed each other, we all worked so closely. The standard for which the brand is upheld is something that makes you sharpen up and an overall better employee. We were each cared about and considered, no one was ever favored, and the flight benefits were an extra bonus. I would work for them again if I could."
good,"I love being a flight attendant for Delta. The pay and benefits are very generous and I mainly get the trips I wants since I speak two languages aside from English. Total gross pay last year including bonus but not including Delta paid benefits was $102,000 after being a flight attendant for 8 years and better than my 11 year corporate job I left to become a flight attendant."
good,Delta helped me out so much through my 8 years with the company. There were plenty of benefits and the pay was awesome. I highly recommend this employer if you can get in the door with them.
good,"During my time in Delta Airlines, it taught a lot of things. My seniors taught me to come out of my shell, and during those times, I get to communicate with different kinds of persons with confidence. I get to be the first one to approach them if they’re having any trouble or not. And with that I have made a lot of friends. I have encountered a mad passenger telling me what’s the point of my job in announcing the Sky Priority lane, I was about to cry because she’s blaming me for not finding her bags that was supposed to come out ages ago, I said my apologies for her not finding her bags immediately and asked her if she wants me to help her in finding it, she said no and just told her friend that it was such a hassle in claiming their bags when they should have it ages ago. I remained calm during those times and the waterfalls came after. It was only my 8th day of work. "
good,"Best company to work for. Great work life balance. Excellent benefits. Cultured environment, great promotion opportunities, Great moral boosting events held frequently."
good,Working at delta is very rewarding and they really do value their employees. multi tasking is a must and being able to learn multiple systems to work in
good,Delta is always a good company to work with. They take good care of their employees and the benefits are excellent. They trained their people to be a better customer service agents.  They treat everyone as family members. And they provided them with good ihealth insurance and 401k investment. Unfortunately I have to retire due to some family consideration.
good,"Depends on the job that day.  If I were at the gates we would basically prepare all of the paperwork for the incoming flight as well as the outgoing flight.  Make necessary announcements and board the plane and make sure everyone was safely on board.  "
good,I like my job I would definitely recommend it to someone else. It is also a platform to take you places around the world to network and broaden and expands your horizons!
good,"Excellent company to work for, I enjoy my job and I would recommend anyone to work for Delta Airlines. It's challenging, fun, motivating, keeps you on your toes and good people."
good,I loved working for Delta.  So many perks and management was great!  There were always contest to win great prizes and trips.  I had a blast working for them and would go back in s heart beat.
good,"I thought i would be at Delta for about 3 or 4 years.  I am now 14 years at Delta and I'm loving every minute.  This is not an uncommon thing at all.  There are many people at Delta who are ""lifers"".The culture is awesome and the people are great."
good,"I worked part time in the evenings. I had a full time job as well. I enjoyed helping the customers and the staff was very helpful."
good,The culture at Delta is what drives the success. The internal and external customers share the same value to the enterprise. Recognition is a top priority. The open door policy is not only promoted but a key part of the culture. Our foundation was if we take care of our employees they will take care of our customers.

good,Like the position just want to relocate to Austin for family reasons It is a great place a with lots of options but just no option to relocate to Texas
good,"What I love the most for working with Delta is the flight benefits. With this benefit, I can travel the world very easily. Additionally, you have so many benefits, for example, wireless internet for your phone, cars, electronics, and so many more."

As a company Delta takes care of their employees but in return they expect and usually are successful in getting the very best from them. Safety is the top priority with this company with continuous improvement coming in close behind. This company knows that the employees are what makes the difference and does not hesitate to reach them at all levels for their feedback. In return Delta is very generous in rewarding employees for great ideas.

good,Typical day at delta consisted of completing assigned work orders.Work place was very team oriented. Enjoyed working solo sometimes and i developed some great customer service skills
good,Enjoyed it thoroughly. Culture is infectious. You are in charge of your own schedule. You are in a position to impact people in a tremendous way. Both internally and externally.
good,"Great job with great benefits. They listen to their employees, give great training, and there is much opportunity to grow. If you don't work well under time pressure the job isn't for you. It's a lot of getting planes out on time. Also if you can't handle upset people the job isn't for you. Traveling is stressful, you need patience and need to want to help people."

good,"Typical day 4am lobby full of passengers 100plus checking for flights all around the world. I learned how to talk to people i may never talk to on a day to day bases, but how to be friendly and hard at the same time. Learned how to handle passengers with disabilities and what they need from us. Hardest part was telling someone their flight has been cancelled and seeing the disappointment on their faces. Most difficult part is handling families of soldiers that are coming home in a different way from how they left to serve our country. Standing on the tarmac with the family and holding their hands while their loved ones are being unloaded with that american flag on their coffin. But that is also so rewarding, being their for that family and them knowing were are there with them and we care. Meeting people from anywhere and just being able to make people excited about flying."

good,"I flew as a first officer on the MD88 and MD90 out of DFW until it closed as a pilot base.  Most of my last two years I was number one or two in seniority in the category at DFW.  Being so senior I always got my first choice in bidding lines of time, so I never flew weekends.  My trips were 3 or 4 days long and I would choose fun layovers.  There was no such thing as regular route.  They were different each week and each month.  Most days would include 3 to 5 legs with a decent layover.  My duties included doing the exterior pre-flight of the aircraft, doing the interior pre-flight, loading the flight plan into the navigation system, and running all the checklist.  The captain would almost always fly the first leg out of DFW and I would work the radios.  Then we would alternate on each subsequent leg.  "

My day begins by instructing ergonomics program in the beginning of my shift in the morning.  The ergonomic program is designed to promote safety by reducing on the job injury and company cost. You have to get a basic understanding on different processes in order to complete the task properly.  Not understanding the process could damage the aircraft part.  The process standard is a manual used to clean an aircraft part.  Some process standards only require soap and water.  Other process standards require dangerous chemicals that are highly corrosive. I am required to wear personal protective equipment.   You must be able to lift at least seventy-pounds in my work area.   The most enjoyable part of my job is giving safety and health tips to my co-workers, and training new hires."

good,Coming to work early in the morning and having hundreds of people ready to check in for flights. I learned about life. The managers were great and very professional. The workplace was like a family. Thou Delta grew from a small Airlines when I started to one of the larges when I left. The only down part of that growth was 911. The hardest part was weather. When the weather was bad thousands of people were stranded and you were there only hope of getting to where they were going. The most enjoyable part were the people and the employees.

good,"In the Flight Attendant role each day is different.  You could be working one flight or four in a day.  Your trip can sign in and it might be a one day trip, or maybe a seven day trip.  This gives variety and allows for crew members to work trips that most closely meet their personal needs.  You can experience multiple time zones and climates in one day which really adds to the variety.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me is getting to work with different people on each trip and seeing different passengers on each flight.  Delta is a very open workplace and encourage collaboration with your colleagues and welcomes feedback that drives change across the company.  Management truly enjoys working along side front line employees and getting everyone involved from the ground up."

Management is always available as they stand firmly behind their ""Open Door"" Policy. The workplace culture is reliable and consistent (very home-like). The most challenging part to this job is finding ways to maintain promoters, eliminating bad experiences. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people you work with. Your peers and leadership (including exec's), are there to support you in every way possible."

good,In the two years at Delta I worked several shifts.  We bid on shifts I believe quarterly so the shifts changed often.  I learned how to deal diplomatically with difficult customers.  The workplace culture was friendly. The hardest part of the job was when we tried to help someone who wanted to use their airline points for a trip and sometimes it was difficult to find flights that fit the customer's needs.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of filling the customer's needs and schedules.  My most favorite part of the job was the free air travel.
good,"Provides unlimited opportunities for advancement, senior managment is open to new idea and employee feedback.  Overall Delta is a great place to work."
good,"In my current role, my typical day is geared towards supporting my team and ensuring that they are set up for success all while driving accountability.

Delta works their  employees hard and at the same time Delta spoils their employees with profit sharing and with pay increase 4 times in 2 years, thats unheard - of. I'm sorry i had to resign because of personal reasons.Not saying the other airlines aren't  good but i can talk for delta because i use to work their."

I enjoy the bond that the employee's share, whether its watching a rivalry football game, or whether its out on the tarmac helping one another hook up conveyances.  I have learned that if you don't know something or how to do something at work, don't be afraid to ask because your coworkers are not afraid to give a helping hand.

I would normally fly three day trips within the U.S., however I began flying six day trips internationally to Europe out of Georgia and then relocated to New York.  I enjoyed taking care of the needs and safety of passengers through out my day.  Management was always supportive of our needs if we ever had any type of problems with our schedules or any type of medical illness.  The culture of Delta Air Lines was always very professional and we were very well trained to do our job.  The hardest part sometimes were delays due to weather, because it could make for a very long day for a flight attendant.

good,"The basic ingredients in music are SCALES, CHORDS, MELODY, RHYTHM, and HARMONY. Jazz education’s purpose is to give you the basics you need in learning to play jazz or to improvise. The jazz musician is an instant composer! The melodies which come from their instruments are conceived in their mind just before they play them. The difference between the improviser and the traditional composer is this: that the “jazzer” has no eraser to instantly correct mistakes. They practice long and hard trying to make their physical body and their mental frame of mind an appropriate vehicle to execute the ideas formulated in their mind."

They also were not compassionate towards those with mental disabilities. Some of the supervisor's and management staff bullied employee's whom they perceived as weak or if they feel an employee did something to another employee whom they favored. Had I had not experienced those events and had I and they known I had a mental illness, I probably will be still employed with this company."

Just knowing we made a difference in the lives of our customers with on-time performance, perks, and making sure they were accommodated in the event of a delay or cancellation. Unfortunately after 10 years of service hurricane Katrina ravished my home town and I was devastated. I contacted the EAP (Employee assistance personnel) and the manager in  San Antonio,TX (where my family and I were taken), came to the shelter to assist me and my family.

good,"When we get into work there is a briefing then we hit the break room to find out what gates we are responsible for during the day. Management and co-workers work hand in hand making sure flights come in and leave on time. The hardest part of the job is working in the freezing rain and extreme heat on the tarmac. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers. Since I've been with Delta I've learned to push,tow and ride the brakes on several aircrafts. Management is in touch with its employees.If time is needed off for various reasons its given. Like I stated earlier working for Delta is like working with your family."
good,"A typical day at work begins with a briefing form shift supervisor alerting us about our daily expectations, flight schedules, and reminding us about safety first. I have learned to work great under of pressure getting flights out on-time. Management and co-workers all work as the team to get the job done in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job is having short ground times and trying to make sure that the flights gets out on-time. The fun part of the job is the job itself and being able to work as a team."
