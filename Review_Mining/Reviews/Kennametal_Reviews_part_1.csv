rating,review
bad,Very stressful. Unachievable targets. Management that do not know the job moaning all the time. Very low morale! Everybody is looking elsewhere. Great bunch of boys though
bad,Managers could care less and the racial tension is real. They have a stand up meeting everyday for no reason cause they care less about your opinion and they are so dismissive of what you have to say.The only good thing about this job is that you get a really good workout.
bad,This place has the worst management and leadership of any company I have ever worked for. They only care about themselves and never take advice or suggestions. It is always their way or no way!!!
bad,It was ok too many made up rules they have there picks everybody wanna be a boss people up front don’t know what they doin always behind never ahead so
bad,"Very selfish company to work for..they dont care about you. All they care about is getting what they need so that the managers can get a bonus, but u wont receive a penny of it."
bad,I didn't like working with Kennametal from day 1. They did a good sales pitch to get me to leave my current company and I regretted it from day 1. They basically just had me fire people due to poor management decisions from executives and board. Promises were made and never kept. Upper management outside of the plant treated the masses poorly and it was known and ignored.
bad,I worked there 22 years and was never told I did a good job even running over production. Very poor management and unfair. You  are just a number and will be replaced.
bad,"Es una empresa que no valora a sus trabajadores y suelen no decir la verdad, la gestión no está a la altura de la empresa."
bad,I loved my job working in the office but they were micromanaging everything which turned the company into what it is now. When it was RTW it was a great company to work for but Kennametal bought us then 5 years later it turned to the worse. In the last 5 years it turned into a place you hated to go to work due to you didn't matter to them. The management sucked and ruined a good company. We were just slaves and nothing else to them. They made a lot of good employees leave due to them not caring about them. Don't ever work for Kennametal.
bad,"This was a great place to work but they have new plant managers every few years and they are always changing policy’s. Very poorly ran."
bad,"No respect, no job seniority,poor management.preach team concepts , but run a dictatorship .tell us we are one of the most equitable companies ,but not to the employees"
bad,I was let go 3 days before my baby was born.   My wife was 40 weeks pregnant and they let me go 3 days before my baby was born for no reason. My manager (boss) was a joke and couldn't manage anything.
bad,management is a mess. absolutely no communication. terrible standards as far as quality goes. workers are seen as a number and not a person. no appreciation what so ever.
bad,"My typical day consists of dealing with poor management and engineers who have no idea how to communicate with the maintenance shop.  We're not allowed to have any overtime even though work is piling up and production is behind.  The equipment is old and constantly requires repairs.  "
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for. They preach ethics, but do not practice what they preach. They are not truthful with there employees. Thought it was a good job 15 years ago."
bad,II tried to tell what your typical day at Kennametal was like but it says my opinion had unapprotive language in my review. so use your own opinion about how it is to work in h*ll.
bad,Poor management.  No team work  at all.  Place continues to go down hill.  I do not recommend working here.  The management is the worst and if you have any issues or concerns nobody will listen to you.
bad,"Kennametal doesn't value the Machinist on the floor getting it done day in and day out. They seem to think the pinnacle of the machining world stops with them, which is absurd. There are far better jobs that pay better with better management that actually value their personnel. The Kennametal I worked at in New Albany, Indiana had to find that out the hard way by losing several outstanding Machinist who went on to thrive at other companies! They claim Integrity as a core value that's a joke!"
bad,"This place is a classic premium example of a ""Chinese fire drill"". Lots of clueless people in ""power"" positions. Main goal is to get dollars on the board - even if it means sending substandard or downright junk parts out the door. The preferred few can stand in aisles socializing all day and compensating pressure is applied to those who work in an effort to achieve goals . Miss the vacation, don't miss the rest of it!"
bad,"Training is non existent. Management lacks teamwork, leadership, and overall vision of the company. By far the worst company I've ever worked for. Upper management is a train wreck. Managers sit around and scream for results, but have no clue how to work as a team to get the right results. Upper management needs to know their customers better and their needs or they will be out of business."
bad,Kennametal has gone way down hill still I started working here. Management doesn’t know what they are doing they don’t communicate. They don’t give raises either. When they let people go or they leave they are not replaced the work is pushed on to someone else without being compensated for it. They don’t care at all about there employees.
bad,"Unprofessional company, disrespectful to employees, try to threaten employees during vacation requests not to be able to use vacation. As the plant manager says"" Be Creative in making them work"".  "
bad,27 years of employment and in recent years focus has turned completely away from employees and 100% towards unrealistic goals and micromanagement . Complete lack of respect for employees almost seemingly targeting high senior employees for termination . I was proud of Kennametal for many years but now its just a machine where EVERYONE is expendable.
bad,"This could be a good company with some good people, however everything is ruined by really bad management and bad culture. Only way to succeed is to please your boss otherwise good performance and bad performance makes no difference at all."
bad,"At first, things were great (I'm a former employee), then after a couple of years & management changes, I saw the Asheboro location fall apart. Often demanded 6 or 7 days a week with no appreciation for their employees or their family life. Has the  attitude of ""I'm the manager & I can do what I want"". HR splits weekly time between 3 different plants in different states so he's rarely available Much of management, including the plant manager, frequently uses profanity while screaming at employees. Make no mistake, they will use & abuse you! Beware!!"
bad,"If you want a life with your family and friends, look elsewhere.  No compassion for personal issues even for a death in the family.  Mostly negative feedback.  Rarely anything positive.  Low moral."
bad,Senior Management is horrible they show up and take a Dog and Pony tour pointing out things they have NO clue on. They run plants with minimal coverage forcing Managers to take more than there responsibility.Make you hold communication meeting with employees daily that are redundant and waste of time. Senior managers arrive at plant with no sense of your business. They allow Managers to hold positions that impact the everyday business that add NO value. There is no holding of accountability for under performing Managers. They promote within people with no education and zero related experience to the assigned position. They promote people within that have no credentials to hold the title.Current PM has an associates and zero years of experience in operations management. They talk safety but don't walk it.
bad,"4 CEO´s in 4 years.  1200 jobs/people were eliminated. When I started sales were over $2.8B, when I left they were $2.2B.  I have never worked somewhere with worse management or worse culture."
bad,"Unprofessional management team (not all). Both manufacturing managers at the time I was there were unprofessional at best.  The HR manager that started there not too long after I came on board also quit.  They were vindictive, treated you disrespectfully and in my opinion, set back employee relations.  Luckily, to my understanding, both have left the company or at least that plant.  Overall, the worst place I have ever worked in close to thirty years."
bad,"Very stressful environment due to constant layoffs while i was there, very demanding of production numbers with a low man to machine ratio. At one time I had to keep 7-8 machines going and keep up production"
bad,I loved working there for the first couple of years..but then I just start going down hill. When they let certain people become leads.They have turned the place upside down.They don't know what their doing. They put unbelievable amounts of pressure to reach 50 lines a hour which is outrageous they don't value our opinions. 
bad,Poor management team pay rate is low supervisors don't care about their workers I work here for 8 years and its has dramatically changed overtime we lost good workers and they don't get replaced badly needs a new management team the benefits and vacation time are the only pros. Too much favoritism going around also .
bad,working in endmill manufacturing department from past 5 years . and having the knowledge of cutting tools and its manufacturing .and having the knowledge and experience in calibration of machine axis .
bad,Ein mittlerweile typisches amerikanisches Unternehmen. Im Moment wird durch dilettantische Fehlentscheidungen im obersten Managment ein ganzer Wirtschaftszweig zerstört. Durch die Schließung von 2 DEUTSCHEN Werken sehe ich schwarz für das zukünftige europäische Geschäft. Große Firmen wollen nun mal eine komplette Betreuung und nicht nur Standartwerkzeuge aus China. Wenn ein Werkzeughersteller keine Sonderlösungen verkaufen will werden die Kunden sich mit Sicherheit der Konkurrenz zuwenden. Ab Werkleiter aufwärts wird jeder entlassen der nach oben irgendwelche Kritik äusert. Jede Firma ist nur so gut wie ihre Mitarbeiter! Amerika first!?
bad,Unsafe with loads of workplace safety violations. They make you do unsafe work threatening your job if you don’t comply. They made me wear SCBA equipment around some of there most deadly gases in the world and would not give me a medical evaluation which is required by law. I just hope no one gets hurt or dies in the facility because they make it very possible.
bad,Bad work life balance due to either working 80 hour weeks or being on rolling lay-off. Management is sub par at best ranging down to a complete waste. Human resources is unavailable for any thing. Safety is completely unhinged from reality. Product has long term negative health effects. Employee moral is poor overall.
bad,"i am not interest in responding in this company   i wont not have much good to say , but the people i worked with were great"
bad,Financial and management review on daily basis.  Daily forecast and expense analysis.  Inventory review.
bad,Last few years were hard.  We heard talk that we were losing our jobs.  We spent the last 6 months training our India replacements.
bad,"A typical day would be review previous emails and pending work "
bad,They don't train you at all. Management is lost because everyone in the front office has a high school diploma
bad,Bust your but only to get told we need more. The management is as two faced as they come. Never feel appreciated for what you do. No joy in the place.
bad,Horrible management. They insist on hireing outside supervisors and managers instead of promoting from within with people who know what their doing. Be careful.
bad,"Pressure and stress of the job is enough to make anyone wanna hang them self’s! "
bad,Corporate office lack respect for the office I worked in because the company laid off people in the corporate office only to give those jobs to us....
bad,"Manangement , Corporate took her down , Rockford plant . Once a thriving world renowned metal cutting tool plant taken out by overeducated college idiots who have no clue . This company wasted millions of dollars .Cross Training was non existent . Those who knew the most were paid less depending on whos (....) you kissed and on and on ."
bad,"My store with Kennametal is a difficult story to explain, my company was purchased by Kennametal and my Job Title and Customer Base was changed to fit Kennametal Work Culture. They called it Synergy by fusing the two companies together which meant Hustle Take over of my Customer Base. "
bad,"Kennametal was an experience in which I went in hoping for a remarkable global industry opportunity.  However, the environment and culture turned out to be something that I was not looking for in my career.  With the culture turning into a very demanding schedule with little empowerment, I decided it was time to make a move.  A promotional opportunity appeared back at PNC, and I decided to head back to where I started my career."
bad,"Little to no communication between management and their direct reports.  Lots of intimidation happening within the company for selfish reasons.  "
bad,"sure the benefits and pay were decent, but OT was mandatory and 12 hour days were the norm.....the employee atmosphere was dog eat dog....you never knew who was going to stab you in the back....total lack of communication....all the supervisors were imported by this idiot who ran his last company into the ground....none of them had degrees in business management and the 'lead' in my department could never keep her 12 employees from acting up/arguing/telling on each other in her shipping dept.... high piece count for order selecting with no weight standards, meaning 25 drill bits you had to pick and package only counted as 1 piece and you had to do 50 pieces an hr to keep your job...Whenever there is a dip in the stock or it's slow they eliminate higher paid employees..."
bad,"Needs improvement... Misdirected continuously, management has very unclear objectives. This facility lacks organization. Hardest part of the job is gaining any direction and knowing what to plan for. Front-line employees are great to work with."
bad,"Not a family-oriented place environment unless your supervisor is in a good mood. "
bad,"Kennametal used to be a very enjoyable place to work. There was no turnovers, people came to work there and stayed until they retired or was forced out due some type of event out of there control. The momentum is none existing along with the morale of the operators. There is no room for growth or advancement there. The operators are not happy at all for the direction things are going in, nor do we have a voice in anything. Awful management."
bad,Very hot nasty place to work .work some people too much friends get away with doing nothing management is awful Human Resources with management I would not recommend no one to work there unless you have no other choice
bad,"Favoritism plays a big part in your success here. If your not the right gender your just a number and the load carrier.the work is hot, dirty and most shifts are twelve hours. This is furnace work that involves working with metals and some chemicals."
bad,There is no typical work day at HQ. Lack of long-term strategy and lots of frequent fires. Executive mgmt is disconnected from those doing the work. The company is more concerned about meeting monthly & quarterly goals for shareholders vs. employees.
bad,"I left in 2006 to go back to school, I felt we would get to retirement and get laid off. Some of the supervisors were there to cut your throat, and make you like it."
bad,"Need better management . It's not a bad place to work other then not enough managers , slack of training. Don't really care if your sick or not . Also lack of communication"
bad,"Worst company for apprenticeship,no transport facility,different and separate foods and canteen for employees and apprentice workers,and not a suitable place to work with employees"
bad,"Management lacks direction and conviction, constantly changing their minds on strategy, corporate structure, and policies.  "
bad,"Good Benefits & Great People To Work With, The days go fast with plenty of work. Continuing to venture into new technology."
bad,"A typical day at work includes taking about 60 calls from endusers and distributors while entering quotes and orders via email, fax, edi, or through workflow. "
bad,I am a former picker in the Cleveland distribution center. Being a picker you get treated horrible and if your not a male a certain Lead in picking treats you so bad. The Lead is not a lead doesn't know anything.She gives no kind of support to her employees.Try to talk to HR and she does nothing.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody.
bad,"terrible management, do not know what they are doing and do not communicate, do not get involved with serious production issues, very terrible on safety ."
bad,I don't know how they've stayed in business so long they work at wasting money constantly moving machinery around Diggin pets in the building film them in with dump trucks inside the building OSHA regulations violations
bad,Worked for Kennametal Stellite / Deloro Stellite for years and had to leave due to bad management. Wont hire enough people to do the job right. Last minute overtime. Cant keep employees. Don't care about your family's life.
bad,Major disconnect between upper management and employees.  It's all about how much money upper management can pocket before pulling plug on company.  POOR overall morale in company.  Stressful.
bad,"Very Busy dealing with many different tasks and issues in a very high paced environment."
bad,Worked there for over 4 years and never felt appreciated. They say they care about employees but that could not be further from the truth. If you can avoid this place do it. Just take a look at turn over rate and you will see.
bad,"Pay was great, however, they will lay you off in a instant without notice and normally during the Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons. Your job status was always uncertain."
bad,Fair pay. Long hours. Unstable work hours. The culture and the people are good but if trying to go to school and work at Kennametal is very difficult. But the vacation days are the best.
bad,"I didn’t mind working at Kennametal at all the job wasn’t very easy as far as CNC operator goes but the manager who moved up from supervisor was the worst person in the world and management was not union so they didn’t really care about our union needs , And if you’re not pro union gung ho neo natzee Then don’t expect to be represented very well if you get in trouble"
bad,What was once a premier company to work for in western PA has now declined dramatically due to poor upper management hires over the years and consistent tendency to reward bad behavior and decision making.  Currently not stable.
bad,This position is no longer existent at the company as they have altered the ir work culture and alleviated all positions of this kind.  No review needed.
bad,"The onsite data center was controlled by India which made it very difficult for communications and management decisions."
bad,"A large company, which makes it very hard to make changes and corrections. Concerned with the stock prices from quarter to quarter and changes sales policies and goals quarterly."
bad,"Kennametal puts on a good front - growth, leadership, all the right buzzwords.  But an aging workforce and resistance to technology put the long term future of the organization at risk.  Younger workers will find themselves struggling to remain engaged as leaders allow the status quo to reign rather than truly innovate.  Traditional views on ""hours worked = measure of productivity"" and looking busy being superior to actual productivity are rampant.  On the bright side, comp and benefits are solid, and the Latrobe campus if a nice place to work.  Kennametal feeds most American (and global) industry, so job security is high."
bad,"Talented people, but teamwork and collaboration are not promoted or practiced. Everybody appears to work in silos.  New generation of managers promoted who are not people people and need education on management.  Currently undergoing work force reductions.  Many people want to leave or are leaving or have left."
bad,"I learned a lot more about myself, my limits and how much I could learn and put to use in other departments other than the one I was hired for. I made a lot of good work and personal friends and work was enjoyable and we laughed a lot on lunch break and we had a great group of guy's. It's gonna be tough to say goodbye."
bad,This used to be a good company.  Recent top management has made some very poor business decisions and lost a ton of good people.
bad,This used to be a good company. Recent top management has made some very bad business decisions and has lost tons of good people.
bad,Very good supportive management. A company stands for 100 % safe and ethical place where you can work without any worries and complete full focus can be given on the work. A place where you get a mix of people of different language and culture and this gives you an opportunity to have a wide network of colleagues and friends.
bad,"A typical day is busy, constant flow of work. I've learned to be able to focus during chaotic hectic times. Managers are available to assist you, if needed. There is a sense of comradery, and teamwork. The most difficult things to deal with, is learning how to organize and handle your workload. The most enjoyable aspect, was working with many good people."
good,They work crazy long hours and you don’t have time for family. Once hired pay is good but good luck getting hired unless you know someone in the higher ranks. They rarely just hire you have to work as a temp and then wait for a position to open. If a full time employee bids on it you will not even have a shot to be hired. And you can’t get on day turn as a full time employee until you’ve worked there for 5 years. They want to push product and don’t worry as much on the quality. I wouldn’t work there again unless they got a better management structure. The work is easy and you can make a lot if you work the overtime.
good,"Working at kennametal was an over good experience. There were many good people that were helpful in completing daily tasks.most people had a good attitude including fellow colleagues workers, supervisors, and maintenance. It was low pay though and hard to get hired on permementaly."
good,"No proper Job description defined"
good,"Good company to work with except HR department. It makes false promises, especially to contract workers & gets the work done. "
good,"I worked at Kennametal for 25 years , and I was a dedicated employee, retirement from Kennametal has been very disappointing, I’ve been waiting 2 months for a retirement package , that should be handed out the day you retire , unfortunately you are fast forgotten by this Company the day you walk out the door , it’s all about money with this company , unfortunately not your money , its sad"
good,there was a lot of brown nosers  there and back stabbers suppersivers had there  favorites you were constantly on edge i worked in tray prep had to ware a tivac suit every day to keep ny clths somewhat clean they were concerened about my health so much that insted of fixing the problem they just bought more stuff that made my job harder and hotter
good,Poor management. They would ask how to make the employees happy and then do everything they could except what asked by the employees.
good,"Typical call center, but poorly managed. Very safe enviroment and great people work here. Not much advancment oppurtunity, but a great place to start in corporate world."
good,Only pro here is that there is a work from home program. After one year of employment you can work from your home. No weekends. Standard customer service position.
good,I don't think I have ever work any place were I liked 95% or more of the people I worked with. The only problem I had was it was a temp position and I needed to be hired so I could get a larger raise in salary and benefits for my family. It is fast paced and very dirty but the people that work there are fantastic.
good,Kennametal is a very good company. They are focused on safety and it is a very clean place. Overall a good place to work. decent money and good work life balance.
good,"Many employees were productive and had a good work ethic from laborers to management. The hardest part was seeing where upper management was and or is taking the company and what part all employees were involved. As Kennametal moves forward with or without some, hope for the best for all."
good,"Data entry and phone calls and too many emails."
good,"Compensation is very good."
good,"Terrible place to work if you have a family or kids, you'll work your self to death trying to meet the quota for the night. With out any notice of appreciation at all"
good,"This place was relaxed and easy, but once the work was done, that was the end of the job. Even with my experience, there was not enough work lined up to keep me there. I guess they hired too many people?"
good,"The biggest thing they need is management that has a clue.Having lead board meetings in areas where no one can hear is insane. Of course when the only object of the meeting is to hear yourself talk, then job well done."
good,Job is good.  Pay is ok for area but no advancement. Management is lacking.  Stressful with high expectations.  Ok for a short term position.  When you begin and finish will not be much change in pay.
good,"The people I work with are great. But the machinery is old and the P.M. there is lacking. So the operators are consistently having to trouble shoot and repair the machines. Lots of oil and carbide dust in the air, on the machines, and on you."
good,"Was a great place to work 20 years ago. They offered a buy out, now they are short handed.  They are cross training certain people. But the supervision doesn't seem to make good decisions."
good,When and before closing a business  down and relocating weigh in the margin on how a cmpany with so much experience employees  contribute to 45 yrs of success.
good,"I liked our management team and the opportunity they provided me to attend training classes. "
good,"Most teams very committed to corporate success."
good,"A typical day at Kennametal would be fitting, welding, and rigging. Very unorganized place to work. Management is poor due to lack of understanding of working environment by office workers that come out in the shop and try to find everyone doing something wrong."
good,A typical work day had me starting at 5AM Do to budget constraints I did not work here very long. I would welcome the opportunity for a longer term     opportunity
good,"Hard work that can be physical, very hot and uncomfortable for long periods of time. The pay is good and the onsite facilities are adequate, if you're not afraid of dirt, heat or hard work you'll be fine. Very safety critical as you are working with furnaces/presses. There is a certain mentality to work there needed, you have to be willing to put the effort in. I would go back there if the need should arise."
good,my experience working for Kennametal was enlightening to say the least. The culture there ca use some improving but the management was very good. My manager was very helpful in helping my understand my role and expectations better.
good,"When this company has work they hire. When there is a slow down of orders they fire. My manager, who was there for Twenty-eight years, once told me that there was no security there. Even he felt threatened. He said; "" If they want to get rid of you they'll find a way""."
good,"Good Company, Experience of working is Good. As Office is located at ITPL, daily commute is difficult. Travel time is more"
good,not a friendly work env.alot  of health issuse with air quality
good,With my position I was traveling a lot and I had foreign subordinates however work life balance was always lacking.  Expectations are high but salary was fair
good,"Good place to work. People are very nice and enjoyed my time when at work. Only downfall is no technical support and there is constant restructuring, layoffs, and plant closures. Seems every CEO has to make there impact felt and it seems to have not positioned the company any better than it was 20 years ago."
good,"Nice place to work and learn about cutting tools. But it is best to join as permanent employee. As graduate trainee, it's very difficult to be taken as permanent employee, management behave like they own the company."
good,policies and procedures are often changed based on current crisis.  Too often these changes conflict with other standard procedures.  Often creates confusion as to what is the right path to take.
good,"My first company & got opportunity for new things to learn"
good,"My work day start with safety tour of the  entire facility. Speaking with every employee and make sure everybody and everything is ready for working day free of accidents. I do the same tour two more times during the day. I attend at least 3 meetings per day. Superior management perform deep micromanaging strategy.Hardest part is that people with accounting education and experience, and lake of knowledge of the process and technology operations, are hired to manage manufacturing teams. Most enjoyable part is that the process is very poor as efficiency, so you have plenty of work to do and never become bored."
good,provided support for all levels throughout the manufacturing process.  provided cost savings and problem solving.  ability to work well with others. enviroment
good,"Good people to work with. Good culture. Fairly, steady work 12 months a year. If you're looking for a paycheck, a very good place to work. If you are looking for any kind of advancement from within, maybe about 5% chance."
good,"No comment, any information is in person, other than I gave a days work for a days pay.This is "
good,Tive uma Passagem praticamente Rapida pela Empresa pois se tratava de uma transição de um Setor que foi Terceirizado dentro de uma Multinacional onde trabalhei por quase 8 anos.
good,"place for learning and 100%safety to worker 	"
good,The work is stable and the people are great to work with but it is extremely hard to get a first shift position. I learned a lot  about being a Machinist and that is a fact.
good,overall Kennametal is a good company.  the acquisition process is depressing for everyone in the former company trying to merge into the Kennametal way of corporate culture.
good,"A typical day would include checking the work load on the burning tables as well as the clad tables.  I will review material to make sure we have the proper mix..  Going over order both domestic and international.  The people that I work with are really good folks  and like any other management team there are positives and negatives."
good,"This company has great talent development if you work at the corporate headquarters, but the structure for talent development at the plant level is below par."
good,"Everybody who worked at Kennematel (Placentia,CA.)was great,from front office to floor mng.,to maint.,shipping and recieving to all workers on the floor.(grinders,press operators,furnace dept.) We all worked as a team to get the BEST PRODUCT out and on time. But all good things come to an end and we were forced to shut operations due to ""restructure and relocate"" the company out of state. Few people were aloud to relocate,but most of us were laid off with a severance package. I worked there for 17yrs.4mon. in the press room/preform dept. and thay no longer needed my services."
good,"The more senior an employee is, the harder they will try to force them out. They get around the age discrimination by offering severance packages. Avoid if possible."
good,Good place to work if you like overtime .every Saturday has been mandatory for the last two years.It use to be a good place to work.Now all they care about is numbers.
good,There are many rolls  and many options to move around to get experience at KMT. Taking full advantage of these options will help you round out your skill set.
good,"the people were pretty friendly, they paid pretty well. they were understanding bosses and willing to work with you. i would recommend a job here to a friend"
good,"Great Management....."
good,"A manufacturing environment.  The plant has to make production every month.  You have to justify your paycheck.  If you don't want to work, go somewhere else."
good,"productive and effective work environment working and manufacturing with allergical parts "
good,Kennametal is a good place to work. The jobs are usually simple. There is a lot of overtime. Internal advancement is difficult. Benefits are expensive. Wage is about average. Management is below par.
good,"Nie było dostatecznie dużo pomocy. Rzucono mnie na głęboką wodę, nie odpowiadano na moje pytania. Taki sposób odsiewu i wybierania najsprytniejszych. Ze strony pracodawcy na pewno dobry, ze strony pracownika gorszy, bo marnują się ludzie, którym nawet by się chciało, ale nie mają pomocy i skąd uzyskać informacji."
good,I dont know really i had a great time at kennametal but its time to move on to bigger and better things im looking forward to advance my skills. I appreciate the opportunity
good,"Company is good, lot of opportunities to learn new technologies,  Enjoyed working, but disappointed with my colleagues and their poor communication skills. Lot of politics,  Loved the job itself - challenging and had opportunities to learn new skills."
good,"The company is antiquite and have a lot of paper. The people there are nice and its laid back.  They take phone calls from employees regarding pay, benefits and address change. They have copier and fax machine"
good,"In both roles at KMT I worked for great managers.  They were flexible, easy to talk to, knowledgeable, and made the every day tasks of the job easier.  The company as a whole has very little room for advancement and raises (other than cost of living) are not given."
good,"this place of work was a slow paced enviroment, it was not faced pace, stand on your feet daily and made parts using brazing, griding and made diamond plate tools."
good,People I worked with were really great supportive team members. Daily challenges which help keep the work interesting. My Manager was very supportive of our team.
good,Started out great place to work but upper management was looking out for bottom line with not much consideration for employees well being.Got very rough working there then they relocated.
good,"as a fresher, i have been given great opportunities to learn, this has made me realize my strengths which i was not aware of, not every fresher would get such opportunities like this, i'm lucky ti be one. :)"
good,Worked there ten years. Had to move on due to toxic environment...insurance was good.. Then they switched (not good)..if I had to go back there I would
good,"This used to be one of the best places to work in Rogers Arkansas, Its been going downhill the past couple of years."
good,Learned a new trade. Fast paced work days. Co workers were easy to work with and willing to teach. Reasonable schedule. opportunities for advancement.

good,"Sehr stressig, da man mit einem Kopfhörer den ganzen Tag arbeiten musste. Mir hat die Teamarbeit gefallen. Der Chef hätte sich allerdings mehr für seine Mitarbeiter interessieren sollen.

good,They push fast training..alot details on special orders..people friendly..but not very helpful..they dont push production until work is low and you move in other work areas.

Used powdered metals to make a variety of products for our customers.The entire process of taking the product,which is easily breakable before it enters the furnaces, and watching it come out as an unbreakable product was very fascinating.

The hardest part will be when the doors close due to our jobs being sent out to other facilities."
good,"My co-workers at the Kennametal Orwell plant are very hard-working individuals who take great pride in their work and in serving our customers.

good,"Average day is not difficult or taxing, not stressful most days. My boss in particular is excellent and cares greatly about those under him. He treats you more as an equal than someone he works over. I can't speak for the higher up managers though."
good,Each night at work seemed to go by quickly. It was a easy job and team effecient. This is where I first began to learn how to operate a CNC and press. I asked that I be taught by someone who had been doing this for a long time and I was granted the favor. My trainer taught me a lot and let the management know when he felt I was able to work alone.

good,"Gutes mittelständisches Industrieunternehmen, leider in wirtschaftlichen Schwierigkeiten."
good,"Whenever I started working at Kennametal the employees trained me on what to do and how to do it. Now I am training the new temps. The typical day for me is working in a cell with three other people. One brazes the tool, one floats and helps out wherever it is needed and the other two clip the tools. I learned that it takes time to know exactly what to do and work as safely and fast as possible. The workplace culture is filled with fun and caring people. The hardest part of the job is actually having to wait for a machine to be fixed when it breaks down because it happens quite often. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting your goals and getting to know the people you work with."

Most everyone there was easy to get along with, and I enjoyed working there and being able to help others in any way I could."

good,"Das gute an diesem Job ist, dass man zum größten teil selbstständig arbeiten darf. Das gute Arbeitsklima sowie die tolle Kommunikation zwischen ""Chefetage"" und den Lageristen hat zu dem guten Arbeitsklima viel beigetragen. Mir persönlich wurde der Job leider sehr schnell zu langweilig, da man in kurzer Zeit alle wichtigen Arbeitsschritt verinnerlicht hatte und sich dann leider nicht mehr weiterentwickeln konnte. Ich persönlich suche gerne neue Herausforderungen, deshalb wäre dies kein Job für mein restliches Leben. Am Besten hat mir die selbstständige Arbeitsweise gefallen."

I learned a tremendous amount about the business.  The company invested in me and provided me several training opportunities to learn.  I always felt part of a team when I was with Kennametal.  There was a tremendous amount of interaction with my fellow supervisors.  We all had to chip in and watch out for one another due to the tremendous workload.  The hardest part of my time there was the work environment.  The conditions were very harsh.  The most enjoyable part of my job was organizing such a large team to meet expectations month in and month out."

good,I worked there 2 years and loved it! Only bad part was I was a temp and never got hired in full time... even though I never missed work and usually made rate.
good,A day starts out from last shift employees telling how their shift went. While working there I learned how to be more productive and to work on my own equipment. The management comes out and gets to know the employees as people and treats everyone with respect. The co workers treat each other as family and all team players. The hardest part of the job was when a customer wanted a order out a day earlier than scheduled and had to rush more to get it finished. What I enjoyed most was everyone was respectful and was able to work at my own pace and still got my work done ahead of time.

good,"Na Kennametal eu aprendi e muito sobre trabalho em equipe e a segurança em primeiro lugar tudo era seriamente pensado e calculado para que não houvesse nem um risco, a gerência não era das melhores mais a empresa em seu todo conseguia suprir isso, as pessoas são muito carismáticas muito difícil você não gostar delas a parte mais difícil era conviver com a falta de material que a gerencia deixava a desejar com o mal planejamento, a parte agradável é que tudo acontecia muito rápido os pedidos de peças eram entregues com grande eficiência"

They viewed helping their employees stay on a continuous improvement track as beneficial to the future of Kennametal.  The 14 years spent with Kennametal exposed me to management that took time to listen to all levels of the manufacturing process.  The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I was helping my fellow workers by doing my best to keep their systems running smoothly.  The hardest part was having to leave Kennametal.  My choices, not theirs."

good,"Working at Kennametal is an excellent opportunity to contribute to the American manufacturing sector in a meaningful way. The workplace culture is helpful and collaborative, but also allows for self-guidance and uninterrupted individual effort. The overall workplace culture is in line with any other large corporation in the US, but each production facility separate from corporate headquarters has its own personality."
good,Great environment place to work where everyone help one another and get along very well. Most important that they take safety very seriously.
