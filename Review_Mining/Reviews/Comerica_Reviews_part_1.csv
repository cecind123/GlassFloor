rating,review
bad,"Comerica discriminates Cancer patient employees and treats them so bad like reducing there work hours from full time to part time with no communication, and pushes them to quit there jobs."
bad,"very unorganized company and lack of knowledge throughout the branch, I would like to keep this to a minimum... I'm not sure why I have to provide this sort of information."
bad,"I have worked at comerica bank for six  month a d got laid off along with 50 other employees in the downtown detroit location. They paid me severance and when i looked at the break down i realized they are taking ""parking"" expenses out of my severance pay, which is ridiculous giving the fact that i should only pay for parking when im on the clock. Dirty company"
bad,Worked at the Plano location. Most racists managers. You hear them make rude comments about other employees. Women are old and jealous. This location has favorites. No moving up. Set in their old ways.
bad,"First and foremost, the systems are so out of date. Who uses a keyboard entirely to process transactions? You barely use your mouse at all. It’s only about the numbers at Comerica. Pay attention to how many positions are posted on indeed and other websites. The turnover rate is just horrible. When employees see that their not valued and not recognized , I’m pretty sure another "
bad,As a financial institution it is the worst. Terrible management and a horrible platform. I am so happy not to work there anymore. I would recommend to stay away from this company.
bad,Not a good place to work. Management is no good. The left hand don't know what the right hand is doing. We are just a number to upper management. Always short handed. One person has to do 3 person job and don't get paid for it.
bad,No answer because this place didn't care about their employees and sells was their main goals not making customers happy. There was no room for better opportunities.  The company dont give any good raises and can care less about employees just worried about making money off of customers.
bad,"I really would not recommend Comerica to anyone. HR doesn’t care that management is poor. Not really diverse, I felt uncomfortable everyday. The way the bankers and management basically taught customers how to structure was wild to me, I come from a background of banking and have never in my life dealt with such a company. If you want an easy job, apply but, be ready to do a bunch of things that is not in your job description, deal with incompetent managers, a very outdated system, and"
bad,"Don't waste your time on such a ""frugal"" company, they might offer you a soda but then turn around and recycle the aluminum can once you're done."
bad,"Knee-jerk reactionary.  Over hire, then mass fire.  "
bad,The pay was ok but the work that went with it was brutal ! Mandatory overtime. three people in a branch no lunches. Managers are so desperate for sales credit they steal your sales
bad,it was a very stressful job and management was very poor and management didn't support its employees.  No training opportunies provided to its employees
bad,"If you’re a contractor expect to receive a 10 year old laptop that runs SUPER slow. It will be about a month before basic things like your phone, webex, RSA Token are set up. There was no onboarding or knowledge transfer when I started working there. The people that I was told to sit with to get information about the projects I was assigned to blatantly said they didn’t have time which I came to learn was because the manager intentially and severely over allocated resources and committed to unrealistic dates to larger stakeholders. It is a high stress environment, highly disorganized with no project management standards or process in place. Employees either laugh about the disfunctional nature of things in the office or argue amongst each other and send strongly worded emails around trying to light a fire under someone to get work done. There is a high turnover rate which also gets joked about quite often by the “old timers” there. Comerica is “work from home” friendly which seemed cool but my experience is that this only added to the problem there."
bad,I worked at Garfield inside Kroger. My manager was Chaldean. She was hired in may of 2017. She was racist and she hated black people.She treated her staff as slaves.
bad,nothing. poor management leadership. will promote if not from their prior employer. too cheap to pay current compensation scale. people quit after finding out that there is no support to help sell the company in the financial industry.
bad,"Company does not train employees well. "
bad,"This is the worst company in the entire country.  If you want to see what computer systems were like in the 80's, work here.  They work you like a dog, retail bank sr. Management is horrible and unethical.  Unrealistic goals and subpar products. Market manager is a jerk.  Stay away if you value your health."
bad,"Busy most of the time, now management backbone.  Hardest part is coming in next day.  Too many ethical issues,"
bad,"making sales- sell bank products- was my favorite part of my job where you get to talk to your customers, listen to their needs and help them solve their finacial issues."
bad,"I started here with extensive experience in banking and I was shocked at how my banking centers were ran. Each place has its own way of interpreting the rules; there is no one cohesive unit, each place will do one task its own way. The turnover is high due to unrealistic sales goals, poor management, poor mergers, and general discontent. The first couple of years here were ok, but as management changed the company went downhill."
bad,"Bottom line...it doesn't matter how great you are at balancing and customer service, your job is all SALES! "
bad,Worked in the SF office. Very bad in terms of quality of opportunity and people. Lots of internal friction within political terms.
bad,"No room for growth, company should have a union. Employees are discriminated against and targeted for termination by management"
bad,"Management is incompetent.  They don't even know how to do the job of their employees, yet they are running the department.  The department is a revolving door.  In my first 8 weeks there; 4 people left the department in that time, as well as 4 hired after me. Extremely short staffed.  You'll be working overtime constantly and Saturdays.  Although, they don't tell you that when you interview.  Only one trainer for all the new hirees.  Trainer is demeaning, rude and horrible at teaching.   Software systems are severely outdated (1980's), which makes the job more complicated than it should be."
bad,You aren't there because you care you're there for the pitance of money and the fact you needed a job. Very boring with little reward and the customers can be crazy
bad,"I was robbed at gunpoint while helping another branch and they sent me back to the exact same spot I was robbed at the very next day. Their daily motivational meetings would infuriate me because they tried to increase morale by saying we're a team, a family, etc. Family wouldn't send you back to a place you were just robbed at. They would send a replacement. I even pointed out a security flaw that obstructed the teller's view of the front door, but nothing was ever done about it, at least while I was there. I wasted a year of my life in hopes that it would get better. The robbery event was the last straw, but there were so many issues prior to it. They have a high turnover for a reason and if you apply here you'll find out why."
bad,"They have no respect for you as a person. Money is ok, you only get paid more if you take on more roles so don’t expect pay raises. I’ve seen too many people laid off with little reasoning in my time here. Some of the people here are nice. But extremely horrible management with no compassion. There are a lot of people in positions that are arrogant, haughty, and like to make you feel little. Please stay away from this company."
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked!  Tons of favoritism, no accountability, fraudulent banking practices...steer clear of working for, or banking with, this company."
bad,"The Austin district for Comerica has had trouble keeping staff on ever since the District Manager took her role. There's a reason why 8 bankers left the company in the first quarter of 2019 and why a CSR who had been there for 19 years finally took his leave."
bad,"So I work in a special program, but from what I can see on a day to day basis, Comerica's technology is stuck in the past and they are hopelessly trying to catch up to their competition. There is a lot of innovation that they are trying to achieve, but recently there have been numerous layoffs in attempts to maintain profitability. As a result, responsibilities are stretched across multiple roles now and there are less people to support its many projects. Advancement? You'll be lucky if you maintain your position if you have not been here for 10+ years, but again even those people were let go in the recent layoffs. "
bad,Poor management always Moody schedules not made until maybe the day before you get your schedule day by day had to make outbound calls like a telemarketer to sell vacation only approved it management is not taking it also two sided as far as one can get approved but the other one can't not fair
bad,"The workplace culture here is very stressful, MESSY, and draining! If you aren't best friends with the ""Who's who"" of the company then get ready for drama and forget about advancing. The most enjoyable part of the job are the clients and the set schedule along with Holidays off.. I learned how cut throat Corporate world can be from working here ."
bad,I would not recommend a job at Comerica Bank in San Antonio.  They do not understand the culture in San Antonio and set their expectations for growth way too high.  They do not give employees the opportunity for any input into the activities or goals required for success.  There is very low employee morale and high turnover.
bad,"This place should be shut down prejudice "
bad,"Management is dishonest, lacks integrity and only cares about their bonuses.  Partnerships/Teams are designed to generate profit for the existing partners and take away from the new partners."
bad,"Comerica has a stale work environment where you are discouraged from speaking to one another or communicating with your colleagues.  Each role expects far more than foreshadowed and the job positions do not fit the salary rate provided. On top of being expected to do more than originally presented, the company will not fund necessary renovations to fix archaic procedures that pose a risk to the company. I personally would not bank there let alone suggest it for a work environment for anyone else."
bad,"I worked at Comerica for as long as I could stand it. First of all, any sick time you take has to be planned(?) or it counts as ""unscheduled"" paid time off, which is basically the same as not showing up in their eyes. If you take more than 3 sick days, you get written up. I worked in an office with all males and they were condescending and constantly talked over me. When I finally brought it to their attention in a ""lets figure this problem out"" way, they started giving me the silence treatment. When I brought this problem to my branch manager, he suggested I sit and speak with them about the way I was being treated (which I told him I had already done) and his next suggestion was to report these people to HR. Being the only woman in the branch, I was not comfortable doing the same thing on a larger scale and expecting things to change or to not be retaliated against. When I brought my issues to another female branch manager she told me ""Yeah, sadly that's just the way things are."" The pace is very slow but for me was too slow. 75% of your day is spent calling current clients to try and get them to sign up for more services which worked maybe once every 50 calls. My branch manager actually had us start calling clients of other branches in order to try and get more business. All in all, the schedule isn't bad but the work environment was awful. If you have the option, I would look elsewhere."
bad,"Pay is garbage, advancement opportunities are as well.  If you enjoy making pennies for the work you do...this is the job for you!  Management doesn't know their A-hole from a hole in the ground.  Favoritism is rampant, and unless you suck up expect to be passed up for any promotion.  Actually got called into my managers office so she could inform me of a 1% raise...laughed in her face. Run away from this position as fast as you can!!!"
bad,"Great place for those wanting a laid back work setting with no real demanding tasks."
bad,Tellers work 6 days a week often with no break or lunch. They make bank on overtime. Hr doesn't pay any attention to complaints. You work EVERY Saturday!!!
bad,"There are some good people at this company, but poor management lowers work place moral in most offices that I have seen.  The bonus compensation is below industry standard."
bad,"Terrible management have no knowledge how to treat personal."
bad,"very overworked, no real backups to the work on your desk, very underpaid especially compared to other companies/similar jobs, not at all forward thinking to improve processes, just kept piling on the work"
bad,Easy job but the management make the simplest of things difficult.
bad,They recently fired 12 employees for a process they breeded in the district.  Some had been there as little as a few months and some had been there for over 10 years.  They had a culture that was extremely stressful and district manager was very unsupportive.
bad,Not the best company to work for. Very traditional and isn’t open to new things. A lot of older employees who are not open to change. Some managers will blackball you.
bad,Poor management stressful and underpaid . Outdated teller systems and outdated branch. Main focus was sells and loans. Rules differ from each branch . Favoritisms for tellers that’s been there for years.
bad,"very stressful invironment do not recommend to work at, management is very rude talks to you like your a kid has no respect for their employees. I use to love to come to work now I hate going into that place"
bad,"Fun environment, but goals are unrealistic. The contact center agents do not put customer needs first. The call center is bias as well as the VP, supervisors and other areas of the bank.  There is no room for growth. There is ALWAYS empty promises. A lot of the supervisors do not remember or understand what it is like to talk to customers who are angry half of the time. They are completely out of touch including the VPs of the call centers.  They only tell what needs to be done, but don't tell you how to do it. At the Texas Call Center we come second and Michigan always comes first and has the upper hand even though HQ is in Dallas. It is clear that training in Michigan is better than Texas training."
bad,Learned a lot but they expect too much with the time you have. You have so many conference calls that it interferes with you outside sales calls. I think they try and micromanage and they would become a larger well known company if they invested in their employees.
bad,"The Legal Department in Detroit, MI is a terrible place for young adults. The management does not help. You are constantly over worked, if you are new in the legal department you are required to be the cover down person for everyone, so now you are overworked with your own and now overworked with the other people you are covering down for. Majority of the people are rude and very sneaky. The legal department has had people come and leave constantly. Some people stay for a week others will stay for a few months."
bad,"Worked in Wealth Mgmnt group appx 4 years. Pay & Benefits were very good. Have no complaints about compensation. Enjoyed people I worked with, including local/ regional mgmnt. Larger organization was unprofessional. People not offered training. Branches competed with other depts for sales, stealing clients. Unhappiness among employees almost universal. Other than pay, I had miserable experience there."
bad,"The best comparison for this bank would be working for a small credit union that offers services but fails in execution."
bad,"Day consisted of processing transfer, opening account, account review and billing, processing mutual funds, managed account billing and maintenance."
bad,"Comerica is the bank from the stone ages and have no signs of changing, upgrading, or keeping up with the times. Their systems need a complete upgrade."
bad,"it's a weekend so no point in rambling on could fill a ton of space and not be done. consider carefully about joining this bank whether retail side or commercial credit. unfortunately most ""credit analysts"" and underwriting associate staff have little idea what they are getting into before they are already on board and it is too late"
bad,"If you like: laid back if-it-gets-done approach, lack of direction, micromanagement from your group's MCU, pay that is well below what peers pay (though this is because the caliber of worker is much different at peers), constant calls to pre-call the upcoming calls, meetings to verbalize every minute detail of what you've worked on, credit managers that have coasted by for such a long time and never been called out, and no room for growth - this is the place."
bad,"Don’t recommend for directly out of college, your opinions aren’t taken seriously and it’s difficult to get consistent projects and work to do. Many people are unwilling to learn new technologies. You will fit in well if you are a data analyst or very interested in finance."
bad,"Not impress with the company, work /life balance is good, but very boring and do not promote people or provide any incentives to do better at the job."
bad,"Zero communication, ZERO training, and overall a bland place to work. Stereotypical corporate america with lack of good management. If you like just sitting at a desk with no training or direction what so ever this is the place with 100% pure confusion"
bad,"Customer service focus has shifted into sales, sales, sales, sales. Management usually get the most sales since they know the clients. Suggest a change to more customer service focus than sales.."
bad,"I am a successfull indivudual with a broad knowledge and a subject matter expert in banking treasury products, services and systems. I have worked in banking for over 26 years with positive and impressive work performance record. Working with Large Corporate and Fortune 500 companies has given me the experience needed to advance to higher levels of roles and responsibilities in treasury management banking."
bad,"Just like all the other reviews coming out of Comerica if your not one of the favorites to management you are never going to see a promotion or a decent raise. The culture at the service center in Dallas is one that could make you wake up in the morning and call in. The employees in the Lockbox department don't work together as a team. Their racist and management plays right along with them to get along even though they see stuff happening right in front of them. H.R. is a joke. They blame YOU if you file a complaint against someone who is causing problems, The supervisors gossip constantly about their employees and tell their favorites confidential information. No training they expect you to sit there and learn on your own and make mistakes and then charge you with errors that go against you. The favorites make errors and were told it's just a learning curve. No work life balance. You can never get off a day when you need it because the calendar is filled up a year in advance. If you have the flu with a doctors note, you will get written up for those days you call in sick. A doctors note is not recognized at Comerica. Stay away from this place. Not worth the stress."
bad,"If you have a poor manager, the job experience will be bad for you. They have very high sales goals. If your manager is not a good, experienced coach, you will struggle to teach yourself what you need to know to get through the job. Upper management has extremely high expectations. Even when you're past your goal, they never stop expecting and badgering you for more. Very stressful environment."
bad,"Communication was good, but dealing with upper management was difficult at times. I would not recommend anyone who likes a more relaxed job to take a position at the branch office."
bad,"Change in Trust department upper management in roughly 2016, dramatically changing the culture and work demands for the worse.  Many individuals have quick.  Some have even left voluntarily without a new job in hand."
bad,"many managers there r about their power, fiefdom. The operations auditor r constantly in conflict with corporate processes/people, banker caught in the middle. Most of these regional operations auditors r waaayy to high on themselves, righteous. systems are outdated , legacy. About 1 in 20 bankers are allowed to move up. Waste of talent, met many competent people. But overall pay is good. Trying to upgrade systems but lack the balls to actually get rid of old legacy processes, generally left in place by old, legacy people who r resistant 2 change... That was IBMs problem in the 90s, HPs problem in early 2000s, Fairchild Semiconductor in the 70s. Why should Comerica b any different? Good comeraderie with other bankers."
bad,"This use to be a company focused on commitment to it's employees and long term employee growth and retention, it is now focused on the short term and replacing loyal people with contract labor."
bad,Comerica is a big corporation and they DO NOT care about their employees. At first they seem to care but if any little thing goes wrong they turn their back at you no matter how good everything else that you have done has been. They have a weird investigation process if there are internal issues that allows employees to retaliate against management when they don't get what they want for example promotions. If you are looking for a place where you will be valued and respected this is not the place. If you are looking for a temporary place that pays a little bit higher than other retail banks and has horrible work ethics then this is your place.
bad,"Focus is on selling and cross-selling.  Regarding staff - focus is on advancing credit specialists to eventual lending officer.  All other staff ignored.  Very much a do as I say, not as I do type of attitude.  No support from staff on special projects.  High turn over, staff leaves for better pay at other banks once experienced gained in banking culture.  Since financial crisis bank continually looking for ways to reduce workforce."
bad,I have worked for this company for over 10 years and have been in a few different departments.  The culture has really changed over the past few years.  The management is getting worse and the lack of training is horrible.  And then when you are not trained properly and you make a mistake they are wondering why.  I am very disappointed with this company the last 5 years.
bad,"The right hand does not know what the left is doing  The customer care is not really there  all about money  "
bad,"micro managed , unreliable old technology, i.e.platform systems,  ATM and teller systems,  not competitive in any way to the big three ( Chase, Wells, BofA),  no customer traffic ever!  worst training in the industry by far, turn over is staggering even for a bank, under staffed at every position,  everyone is cross trained due to shortages, expect to wait months after hire to actually  go to training for  your position. most managers' management  skills are non existent  can't  coach, motivate, lead  "
bad,"Upper management is very good at what they do. Middle and lower management have a condescending, totalitarian management style. I learned not to disagree with anything they say even if you know, for a fact, something is wrong, possibly unlawful, or could be done better another way."
bad,"As a minority employee, the manager was overheard of referring to african americans as n....rs. Though escalated, upper management didn't do anything."
bad,Full time IT employees are being displaced by contract workers from India.  Promotion opportunities are drying up as well a employee training.
bad,"This job is not for everyone. Working in the banking industry is all about setting customers up for failure before they realize it.  It's not right but it's your job. You have to open credit cards, checking/savings accounts and  close loans.  Also, If you're under 30, This is not the place for you.  The majority of your co workers are older and will give you trouble because they feel like you're not ""old enough"" to have a valued opinion.  They like to promote/hire within the company ONLY to people who have put in atleast 9 years. Comerica's values are outdated, which is why everyone is leaving.  I highly recommend one of the other ""updated"" banks to work for if you're under 30!"
bad,Company mostly interested in fees.
bad,Mgmt keep employees out of loop. Mgmt do not ask employees about the wants and needs of the dept. Require to stay late.
bad,"Worked for this company for a long time. Was promoted to an assistant manager and everything was going well, until I was transferred to a branch that was slow, older aged customers and was not doing well in sales. Always short staffed especially in the branch manager role. I stayed there and had to run the branch numerous times without a branch manager. I ended up leaving bc of the treatment. It got so bad. I was treated unfair because of sales goals not being met! But I had no manager to even help me"
bad,"management in beverly hills office is the worst i have every experienced. very traditional type, stick and carrot, threatening on a daily basis do to tasks that are not defined for every type of role at the bank.very slow branch but because of the irrational dictatorship in management very very stressful."
bad,"shrinking personnel resulting in broader expectations"
bad,"I was a customer service representative, so I answered phones and dealt with peoples problems, it was not a good job, FOR ME, could be great for others though."
bad,"My direct report and I have a great relationship. Unfortunately the upper level of management is diconnected with the Banking Centers. The company has core values that do not align with their actions toward the employees operational and sales support and processes. The ability to evaluate and develop leadership needs improvement. The conservative nature of the company overshadows and dominates every decsion made from top down. They are behind the curve in regard to technology offered to customers, they are last in technology advancements for employees reaources and tools used to service the customer. The company offers an overall sub par product portfolio in the finacial services world."
bad,"Unfair treatment to all employees, favoritism. Poor management, lack of strategy and direction. Zero incentives, promoted as best company to work for women but not life balance approach in Austin."
bad,Working there was great but the management was not specially working with contract there was disaster. They have no value of there employees.
bad,The people I work with makes each day worth working within the company. But the overall atmosphere could improve. It's very conservative and the environment is very dull. Some managers do not inter mingle with the staff. Overworked and under paid.
bad,"hard balance between personal life, management can be improved. Everything is hands on, learn as you go. Good benefits."
bad,Working for comericas customers service telphone banking center was a interesting experience. Nice people.
bad,A position at this organization allows you no upward mobility and very little in regards to growth and opportunity.
bad,Offered competitive compensation. Great training for accomplishing Business Sales goals. Upper management lacked consistent leadership skills.
bad,Comerica Bank has a unique culture that is unique. The company is ran like a business that is unionized and generally people are promoted or recognized by years of service versus ability.
bad,Not a health work environment. Too many people overworked and concerned about losing job if the don't put in 80 hours a week. Management appears to be unwilling to hire more staff when I worked there.
bad,"New management came in and let go of many seasoned veterans, replacing them with offshore contractors that didn't know the systems.  Management is only looking at bottom line and not concerned with impact to clients or customers, only meeting their goals."
bad,"Comerica tried to tell its employees that they are a regional bank and doesn’t want to be like the bigger banks like Chase, Bank of America and WellsFargo.  The problem is that they price every product according to those banks and don’t have the convenience or technology to be competitive."
bad,"Comerica is an okay place to work.  Most managers are willing to let you have a flexible schedule which is nice.  However, with jobs being eliminated and positions not being filled the work load has significantly increased and pay hasn't.  They expect a lot from you and don't pay accordingly.  It's great for entry level positions because you start off high but as you advance, the raises are very small through mid-level positions."
bad,"I been employed with Comerica for 1 year.  It is very stressful, bank process is out dated including it's systems which makes it hard to do our job efficient.  Management is clueless of the morale or simply do not care.  Life balance is hard to achieve when we are asked to complete our work within a certain time frame when the process is redundant and tedious. Compensation is certainly not competitive with other banks. I am working harder with more stress and making less in salary.  There is no room for advancement or growth, not in the Houston Market.  I am learning that being promoted is not achieved by hard work, but is achieved by threatening to leave.  Health and 401k benefits are good compared to other banks. Lay offs on going."
bad,"Could be a great place to work for a person already working in banking, they make more then most banks. They don't listen to feed back. they will tell you you can move up quickly but after you talk to people that have been with them they have never gotten a rise. try to get the money you would like to make up front before joining."
bad,"The workload is easy once you get used to it. Its ok but i felt the company doesn't really appreciate its workers. I felt there was also no trust and communication anymore for the workers and the corporate system, just a bunch of policy's that have no meaning but to fire a person instead of actually talking and understanding one another. I felt there was no  opportunity to rise over the ranks, just a way to waste your life for years until you have no choice but to keep working there because its too late to change."
bad,The bank doors open at 9am and close by 5PM most days. Everyone is trying to obtain goals in a low income area with little growth. Managers are salaried.
bad,"A typical day was checking customers' accounts and main forcus was on the boss who was  a regional manager, and his calendar and time needed much attention, I don't think that a banking organization is the right place for me to work, I would rather be in more of a layed back culture"
bad,"does not treat all employees equally"
bad,A good place to learn new skills and employess are generally positive and supposrtive. Enjoyed resolving issues and assisting customers with their needs.
bad,"The best part of my job were my co-workers.  They were great and supportive.  The hardest part of this job, is no matter how hard you work, management was not satisfied.  I felt like I could never work hard enough.  I worked at least 60 hours a week.  I believe in hard work, however this was work hard, then harder, then exhaust yourself.  I did work there when the recession began so in the 3 years I was there I never received a bonus or raise, I was told I was lucky to have a job.  I learned it was best to just come in sit quietly and do my job.  Suggestions for improvement were quickly batted away or taken negatively by higher ups."
bad,"The company overall is a good company.  Retail banking centers are not the best environment to work in.  They are going through a Gear Up that is eliminating positions and you might want to fear at this moment.  Policies are in place, but offices seems to follow their own and no 1 location is consistent."
bad,Very challenging time at Comerica Bank as activist shareholders forced an expense reduction plan at Comerica Bank.  Lots of consolidation occurring and flattening of the organization.  All activities are geared at expense reduction at the expense of long-term client satisfaction.
bad,"Very to no training in products and a lot of training on Sales and marketing. "
bad,"There is no culture at this job. The people you work with have sticks up their ****** and are afraid to voice their opinion in the financial industry. It is very black and white, boring and bland. 40 hours max, benefits are amazing, but you will not love your job. Sitting in a cubicle all day with no music, no pics."
bad,I did not like working here the coworkers and managers are rude and inconsiderate. The customers that visited already had a bad attitude because of previous customer service they experienced here.
bad,"if you want to be in the bank industry this is a choice but dont expect advancement unless you are willing to brownnose to management like most people do"
bad,"The Quality group was well managed, fun people to work with and good management."
bad,"The pay was ok, the hours were fine, the work load was intense due to understaffed branches. The managers at my location were very moody. Comerica could have been a easier experience with better Management, better HR support, and more updated technology."
bad,"I will say I did learn a few things going through their training program initially. Once at the banking center level the management is definitely lacking and overall morale is low. Very high turn over, minimal opportunities for advancement and somewhat low pay are recurring topics."
bad,The company is short staff but you are expected to perform as if you are full staffed. You are expected not take a full lunch due to staffing issues..
bad,"The company culture is extremely poor. Management/employees are not friendly or personable by any means, very negative and old environment. Only bank in the state with no chips in credit/debit cards, poor technological advancement along with lack of innovation and motivation within employees. Extremely poor management system, they hire 4 managers for 2 employees which means everything was micro managed and controlled, leaving no room for innovative ideas or thoughts from employees. The company needs to re-structure the org chart and get rid of A LOT of management. The benefits were good along with time off, pay is lower than average for normal banking jobs. Would not recommend."
bad,Managed various lines of business within the Wealth Management division.
bad,Working with customers is the best part of the job.  Tremendous amount of pressure to sell.  Coworkers are great.  Lousy management
bad,"The best thing about being a bank teller is the relationships you build with your customers and the ""Banking Hours."" Other than that, being a bank teller is bitter sweet, slow paced environment, but stressful at the same time due to being responsible for large amounts of cash. Pay rates and pay increases/raises are terrible."
bad,No promoting within. Not a diverse working climate what so ever.
bad,Hours varied. I learned how to be a teller. My immediate supervisor was very fair. The constant push for sales was the hardest part of the job. Tuition reimbursement was the bast part of the job.
bad,"Upper management only cares about themselves. If you're lucky, you get a good group of people to work with. Major cutbacks have happened causing many to lose their jobs. There's good days and bad days. Stress level is super high due to goal requirements and my various roles."
bad,"A typical work day consist of taking a large number of calls from customers, and processing and correcting their issues. while this is how the job is presented at its core it is a sales driven position. This is measured on a monthly basis that shows how well you are able to sell products. There have been many things I have learned while with the company, such as running groups, coming up with strategies to make site more effective at hitting its goals. With everything that can be learned there is not a lot of room for advancement. the departments are small which is great for the collaboration that takes place, but does not lend it self very well for changing departments or promotions. The hardest part of the job would have to be the selling aspect, not everyone is a natural sales person which can make this a very difficult aspect to grasp. The down side to this is that the job is based on sales. So if sales or selling is a point of weakness this would make working more difficult. On the other hand one of the more enjoyable parts of the job was the bonding with the other team members. The collaboration and just the general helping of each other makes working there that much better. Just remember that in the end the monthly goal dictates everything."
bad,I worked as a commercial loan processor.  There was a lot of training that was given.  My co-workers were great and friendly.
bad,Typical work day was slow . Not alot of foot traffic. Lot outbound phones that let no where. Be ready to throw product down customer throat. Customer can sometime be mean but loved my repeat customer
bad,Expect Corporate 101 atmosphere where nothing more than is expected is required.  Divisional setting that has broken links requiring strategic management to advance.
good,requires long hours with little compensation.  Paper work for tracking sales is extremely time consuming.  Does not empower employees.  Does not do the right thing for customers.
good,"Comerica Bank was struggling for a direction in its institutional custody and investment businesses.  The overall decline in interest rates had a deleterious on the revenue derived from retirement services which was compounded by Comerica's limited scope in the institutional trust and investment space."
good,Performance reviews and promotions are biased and not based on actual job performance.  Very disappointing.
good,"In this position, sales was the atmosphere of the job. You had to sell in order to be considered an asset. Customers needs were second in all that you did while sales drove the vehicle!"
good,"I enjoyed working for Comerica Bank in Aptos for the most part. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, however I do feel that a certain member of my team had it out for me. I feel that I was treated differently than everyone else and racially discriminated against. Overall, I do feel that Comerica is an OK place to work, but I would not recommend it to friends or family."
good,"moderate pay"
good,Within the two and a half years at this company we had 4 different managers.this was not the ideal location to work.
good,"My peers were like family to me. Relax time was lunch."
good,"Sit down, work, don’t present new ideas, anyone who isn’t a white male is overtly ignored and overlooked on several instances since I’ve been here. "
good,"This is overall a great company to work for for the hours and benefits alone. Always have the holidays off so that is definitely a bonus, but if you come in through the call center be prepared to be treated like you are as disposable as the trash they remove on a daily basis. They do not waive any personal occurrences or tardies. No matter what the case may be.. I.E. family emergencies, jury duty, child sick.. if the time is not available and you take it. Thats two occurrences right away. Nothing and I mean absolutely nothing falls off your record for a year and that right there is why no one can keep their position. They will rehire you after a year of separation and thats only if you resign right before they fire you so they can avoid paying for your unemployment benefits. My suggestion, get six months in with no tardies/ occurrences and keep moving departments until you are no longer paid hourly. Either that or find another career. Best advice I can give."
good,"Maybe other areas are different, but the data center environment has no growth potential and the shift/schedules leave no room to have a personal life - weekends and holidays required."
good,"Comerica is a very old bank and conservative by nature.  In terms of technology I'd say they're far behind other large corporations.  They could pay more, and I think in order to retain the next generation of bankers they will be forced to pay more.  Lastly, politics are a very strong influence there.  You can be great at your job and do far more than what is required, but if you're perceived as a threat because you do it too well, or someone generally dislikes you, you're potential to grow is capped.  What makes the form of politics at Comerica particularly egregious is that its played on a manager-subordinate level, not colleague-to-colleague.  So you really have no recourse when you find yourself on the ""losing side."""
good,"Everything falls back on management discretion so there is no consistency on Flex time, work from home, promotions and job descriptions. Won't pay for overtime and just tells you to come in late one day within the pay period."
good,"Good management. Fair and consistent.  This is the type of place you can work for the next 10 to 15 years,  The pay is little better than other banks out there."
good,"Start out doing opening procedures.  Then make plans on how your day should go. Really hard to accomplish goals, when you are doing multiple jobs at once. While still trying to call clients to buy products. Coworkers are extremely negative. Which is more draining than the actual job."
good,"Too much turnover, not enough accountability for business partners.  Mediocrity is tolerated too much here.  Constantly changing initiatives and poor management."
good,"Great bank to start a career,valuable knowledge for inspiring banking professionals from top to bottom.  Rigorous training sessions that enables an individual to excel at any levels, with that stated it maintains a glass ceiling towards its goals and expectations of people."
good,I really enjoyed working at the bank and the people were very friendly.  It was a temporary position for me so I just ran teller transactions throughout the day.
good,"Company dress codes are great, management needs to work more with their employees"
good,"Poor Training and high employee turnover made it a very difficult job to get a comfort level with.  This particular job was a production environment and errors were tracked.  I had done this job many years prior and quality was always a priority not production, therefore I had a hard time in this environment.  My error rates were low but I was unable to keep up with the production requirements.  I left the job and the company to move to a new city in Michigan."
good,Not much room for advancement. Have to wait on turnover or retirement in order to move up. Compensation was great. Some unreasonable expectations for management to complete
good,"The culture at Comerica Bank has significantly changed as many of the tech jobs are being moved offshore and infrastructure moves to the cloud.  I hired in as a part time employee and stayed for 25 years, most of which were good years."
good,I can write a book but not today not tonight. Comerica is known for if you have a lot of years with them or making ok money they lay you off to bring someone else in making less.
good,Comerica Bank has provided me an excellent opportunity to learn and gain experience in my profession. The company suffers from analysis paralysis and struggles to commit and move technology forward. The company is currently restructuring and employee morale is suffering making the once community feel of the culture putting employees on edge.
good,The job overall requires a lot of patience and attention to detail. The main issue is Comerica is behind on technology which makes most day to day activities more difficult then they should be.
good,"Given the recent reorganization that Comerica has undergone, the culture at the bank has been stressful.  Each month dozens of people have been laid off.  However, I've enjoyed my project and the team that I managed.  There is no typical day, as a project and a support team are forever in flux, changing with the needs of the client.  I am generally in meetings for much of the day, while fitting in time to update project schedules, budget forecasts and ensure the clients are comfortable that their needs are being met."
good,Comerica is the definition of micro-management. Their benefits are very fair and compensation is above average. They leadership expects too much for the tools they are given.
good,Great benefits; enjoyed co-workers; invested in training employees; good resources available for employees; appreciated work-life balance; online training resources are also available.
good,Intense sales focus culture. Need more focus on employees and improving technology. Technology is outdated. Great compensation plan.
good,"Received inbound calls from customers to assist with new accounts, close accounts, open new accounts. Offer other products that may benefit them. Mostly sitting, co-workers were great! Hardest part was sitting for my shift. I like to move around, I am a very energetic person."
good,"The hardest part of the job is the structure within the loan center operations department.  It is disjointed and lacks a clear path.  Management has ideas, and talks a good game, but clear cut responsibilities and the tools to meet the expectations have been lacking."
good,The distance and transportation is the most difficult and I am unable to transfer.  With not being trained on all systems make my job more stressful than is necessary.
good,"Loaning money to businesses; learned that banks don't like to loan $$ to businesses. Management typically out of touch with reality, not listening to the front line workers (me). Co-workers more interested in keeping their jobs than working to get the job done. Hardest part of job was going to work knowing most of the time you would fail. Best part of job is meeting interesting business owners who truly believe in what they are doing."
good,"Comerica is an old school who you know company. If you know the right people you can advance, otherwise, get out!"
good,"Needs to move faster with Technology. I wouldn't bank there if I hadn't worked there.They don't train well. It's a learn as you go & most everyone passes the buck there.The reasons above are the reasons they were rated 3 stars BUT most employees are great, some management are great to work with. The longer you are there the more paid time off you get."
good,"Department was not stable. Management made organizational structure changes every year. Processes are not in place to hold accountability. Rules constantly broken depending on management decision. Unfair practice,"
good,"Lacking in training and development. Staff scaled down so much, ability to train employees properly is severe. Hiring managerial staff from outside has also caused a breakdown in the ability to train."
good,It really depends on what department you work in.  Raises are miniscule - difficult to get moved into higher paying position.  Most moves are lateral so they don't have to pay you anything.  Benefits are excellent.  Low out of pocket expense for benefits.
good,"People are great to work with, management is very flexible on giving time off and allowing users to work remotely.  Work is always bountiful due to everything being out of date and new technology breaks old technology.  Old timers will not move off of old technology due to ""it works so why fix it""."
good,"Goals are not high, and incentive is small.  Very few opportunities for growth.  "
good,"Management is focused on cost reductions, so growth has lagged.  Technology is dated at the organization.  Co-workers are great to work with.  With all the downsizing over the last few years employees that remain have to pick-up the added work-load.  The most enjoyable part of the job is coworkers.  Hardest part of the job is the increased responsibilities, with no supplemental resources."
good,"The Bank has reviewed its management structure and has made significant changes recently. "
good,"talking to customers, resetting passwords, is really all I do everyday all day. Its a stable and stern environment. My co-workers are pretty cool and fun to talk to."
good,"very aggressive, be ready to sale. there is nothing else to say"
good,Collating faxing filing and mailing of documents. Management could be better as far as being discreet with the employees info. But overall a decent company to work for.
good,"It really depends on the location and management. I’ve been to banking centers where everyone gets along and it’s a great environment. On the other hand, and more often than not, it’s a really bad working environment. The managers speak to their staff like they’re children and everyone is trying to find another job or move to another department."
good,"Great job to get experience in the banking and financial world, if thats where your career wants to go. Systems are a bit outdated so it really teaches you the entrance levels if banking. Great benefits."
good,Comerica has unrealistic sales goals along with high out going call numbers. Sales is more important than customer service. Waiting times to see a platform representative is to long.
good,"The worst part of the job is the top-down culture. Fundamentally, leadership tends not to listen to the knowledge workers, which impedes the effectiveness of the organization."
good,"Comerica has a strong bank culture but many practices that are not in the client's best interest for a wealth management firm. There are not enough dedicated resources for private bank clients. Most importantly, they do not bring licenses over for their private bankers."
good,most positions are routine  based but employees are able to shadow  other positions and  network.     The workday was not overrun with unnecessary meetings.   Clear goals make up for low level of flexibility in  the work day schedule
good,"My daily work day functions consist of daily  goals and, commentates. I 've learned that setting goals in the environment benefits to success in the position. I have a very hands on Manager that leads by example. The work environment at times can be stressful but, overall enjoyable. I find that the expectations on Sales has been challenging at times. The most enjoyable aspect of my job is assisting my customers and providing excellent Customer Service."
good,My time at Comerica was enjoyable and I learned a lot. The team was great but I find myself looking for things to do that will challenge me every day.
good,"enjoyed working at the bank for the hours worked and great management team, 401k match wasnt an option, and is very important, pay was fairly descent."
good,"Working at Comerica Bank opened the doors to a lot of valuable experience that will elevate my career to the next level. Working and learning about financial rules, regulations, and how financial institutions comply with these rules to foster ethical business practices."
good,Comerica's CEO is consistently ranked as one of the poorest to run a major Fortune 500 company.  He has run the bank into the ground and has yet to fully recover from the financial collapse in 2009.
good,If given the proper leadership this job would have worked out for me but not put in the right environment to succeed. Management had a very hard time meeting their goals so they begin to micromanage their employees
good,"Sales meeting every morning,commitments are given everyday, daily branch balancing researching any outages. Process transactions, high volume cash handling"
good,A typical day at work starts with working as soon you clock in.  No time to break always on a time frame. Errors are non existing they want you to be perfect.  Management is horrible and never get fair raises.
good,I worked there many years ago and in various departments of bank. I have learned since my employment no longer a Michigan base company bank. Now in Texas.
good,"Depending on what you want to do or how you want to live your life Comerica may or may not be your place.  "
good,It's a good place to work but upper management needs to be more involved with the management in the branch. The hardest part of the job is to keep up with your goals which are raised every year.
good,"Working with a young group of professionals"
good,"Corporate mission was admirable, however often obscured at middle management level.  Lack of control of this mid management led to much waste."
good,"This job will teach you a lot, very good hours. but the bank only cares about sales goals never employees. you can get fired for not reaching your sales goals even if your are a very good teller who balances every day with good attendance. higher management makes the sales goals without any regards to the branch location and if the goals are reasonable or not. they always compare you to other tellers and tell you how come so and so teller is reaching her goal and you are not."
good,Comerica is a good place to start your career.  You learn a lot of basic skills to develop as a professional.  Pay is competitive with the banking industry.  Technology is outdated which causes manual processes.
good,Easy job to do every day. No need for long training if you are coming in new. Management is no help in customer service issues you either resolve it yourself or call the call center for help.
good,"Mainly Data Entry and 10-Key with daily deadlines, room for advancement with training built in, friendly atmosphere. Fun employees with monthly production reviews."
good,I worked there for a few years and it was great work experience and it definitely gives you the opportunity to move up and become more successful. I’m glad I got to work at Comerica  I ended up leaving g because I got a better work opportunity elsewhere but it was helpful to have working here on my resume
good,"Pretty challenging environment."
good,"If you are looking for an opportunity in commercial banking right out of college, Comerica Bank has a wonderful opportunity in their training program. While the training program is the premier program compared to their peers, the compensation is not overly competitive, and advancement opportunities at Comerica Bank have a slower timeline than I would have preferred."
good,Working for them was great until the customer became the one with millions and i only had thousands. To keep a customer was all they believed in even if the customer called you bad names.
good,I had to work through my lunch to keep up the work load. The work load was for three people but they I was the only one processing the work.  Also I had to train on how to process new work with no one to help process my work.
good,A typical day was establishing relations with new and old customers. I learn so much about politics in the management department and what makes a great leader.
good,"They pay more than what other major banks are paying. That was the biggest upside. They are a small bank and they struggle at times. I know they recently closed a bunch of their underperforming branches in Houston, TX."
good,"I gained experience in collecting data"
good,Flat organizational structure.  Opportunity to demonstrate skills to upper management.   Has to work on becoming a better known entity outside Michigan and Texas
good,A good entry level position into management. It provided an opportunity to learn the importance of customer relations for continual growth. Relationships are a key factor when it comes to managing someone else's money.
good,"Full benefits (health insurance, 401K,....) but all the perks (bonus, Christmas party, even morning coffee...) were cut off! If you disagree something with the boss and follow the chain of command, the higher boss won't listen to you unless you ""personally"" know him/her more than your boss!"
good,you will not be rewarded for your hard work. i am working hard equal to two people but no raise or promotion. i am mentoring bankers while i am a csr. so i need raise.
good,"Great culture, fun time recruiting. Rigid on structure, can often take a while to get promoted. Loved coming into work every day. Definitely recommended."
good,Need to update ATM machines.  The department was in need of a complete overhaul because of not being properly managed. Employees were not very happy with the work load
good,Tough place to lend.  Too conservative policies.  Locations are all in strip malls which are challenged by homeless population.  Just cut a bunch of locations all over CA.
good,"A strong Middle Market Lending Bank. I managed a group of lenders, in terms of quality of credits, process and sales goals. I took a very active role in making customer calls to support the officers' sales efforts."
good,"It is a great place to start a career, especially for students right out of school. However advancement within in the company does not pay well financially. Employees tend to feel over worked and underpaid."
good,Love my coworkers and customers. My manager is unprofessional and is the reason on my decision of wanting to leave. A typical work day is very relaxed for the most part slow paced being its a small bank but my manager makes the work environment unenjoyable.
good,This job has helped me grow as a person and an adult. Management was great and taught me a lot and helped me to understand anything that I didn't understand before.
good,"It became more about SALES over SERVICE. We were forced to push loans, credit cards and other accounts on customers whether it was needed or not. Also made to call customers at home to sell."
good,"Good place to work learned a lot, great business products competitive rates, Day to day customer service, schedule meetings and events with clients & potential prospects."
good,Overtime is often required to meet project deadlines.  The team I was on not supported by upper management.  The overall IT culture has changed dramatically in past few years due to reorganization.  One of the hardest parts of the job was having to write your own performance review. The colleagues I worked with made my job easier as they were always willing to offer their assistance when needed.
good,"It was an experience; one that I will NEVER forget."
good,The workplace culture was professional and detailed. They were very disciplined and organized. They provided a stable environment. It was challenging at times.
good,"wasnt impressed with the operations, management or the culture. Very stuffy and not a fun place to be. Sales materials and information for customers is limited along with products"
good,"always short handed this negativity affected customer service"
good,"The learning experience was great, I learned a lot and many a lot of knowledgeable people. I think the goal should have been marked by location since some areas were busy than others"
good,"Behind the times on salary and technology. Multiple layers of management makes it difficult to get things done. Good opportunity to advance internally, but must be willing to play the game."
good,"Learned some things but most learning was on your own time."
good,"At times can get very stressful, Is easy to move up in the company and does not require a degree to do this. Customers make the job worth the wild, and to each it's own"
good,The Comerica experience was overall good but not great. They do not compensate for the amount that they pay the employees. The constant sales pressure with possibility of losing your job if you do not meet the goals they set. This at times could be very stressful.
good,Production based environment. Had to meet daily deadlines. Management was ok but seemed to show favoritism. Pay was fair. Always busy so the day went by quickly
good,"Great place to work. Co-workers are fun and get a long well. Management could be more flexible on time off for non-exempt employees especially as it relates to weather days.  Flexible work schedule would be a plus for non-exempt employees since salaried employess are able to work from home.  Would be great if we could have a workout facility for lunch hours."
good,Balanced retail and commercial accounts. Mail back customer receipts to the branches the management was very helpful the hardest part of the job was the large transactions.
good,Good place to work. Helpful and loyal employees who are very hard workers. Good benefits are offered. Great community volunteer opportunities.
good,"Comerica Bank is still behind the times concerning with competing with other banks.  Therefore, it is more difficult to meet goals.  If you are not in the inner circle, promotion or advancement will not be attainable."
good,"Good company,good benefits, no formal training, nice people"
good,"Comerica is struggling to keep up with technology. They are reactive rather than proactive. A lot of crony-ism, it's a real ""old boys club."" Lots of gossip."
good,"Overall Good Job. Great Leadership and Teamwork. 8 hour work day, hour long lunch. Co-workers were friendly for the most part. Enjoyable part of job was the customers and the conversations you got to have with each one of them. The hardest part was the selling products."
good,Typical work days involve calling prospects and an assigned portfolio. Customer service is now a focal point. Management changes frequently within the company because managers are business champions and spend half the time out of the office visiting small businesses or call blocks.
good,"taking care of transactions as a teller, opening new accounts"
good,No room for advancement and management tends to be lacking. Good work/life balance.
good,Good company to work for. Changing strategies almost daily. It's a small bank that wants to play with the big boys
good,"Good Place to work if the bank is located near you. "
good,"I have worked at Comerica for 10+ years, and I have learned many things while here. I have met some people who will be life long friends, and I have acquired some skills that I wouldn't have learned otherwise. "
good,The culture at Comerica was not client focused.  The Trio Deposit sales tool created tension among bankers. 
good,The people at Comerica are great! My position gets to travel to different branches and work with all different people. The management has been so helpful. The best part of this job is building relationships with customers and being able to help them with their banking needs.
good,Enjoyed being part of a prosperous bank with great potential for growth. Learned a breadth of knowledge regarding the backend operations of a bank.
good,Great management time and knowledgeable co-workers. Well defined process and procedures in place to ensure risk management.
good,I really appreciated the opportunity to assist customers with their account needs. I met and exceeded every goal placed before me so I had no performance issues.
good,"talking incoming calls on customer inquiries about bank products, mortgage needs, insurance, and addition financial need to make there life easier. I enjoy my job its just i feel im not challeged enough to further my learning experience. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping that cutsomer that didnt understand a certain thing or need more advise about long term goals."
good,"Be ready to sell. There is the minimum of training and then you are thrown into the job and expected to generate sales immediately while competing with your bosses. Branch manager, asst. mgr, and personal banker have similar sales goals and compete for the same customers. Guess who wins. If you are a gung-ho salesperson and experienced in banking, you may thrive here. Results count for everything. If you are not that thrilled about sales, try a back office position."
good,"Earnings have been generally flat So “cost control”, which means salary, perks and other benefits are also flat. If you survive the frequent headcount reduction you will be doing more with less.  Detroit employees get the shaft. It used to be a good place to work."
good,was at a desk all day receiving phone calls about their bank accounts.  a typical day at work was to come in and log in to your computer.  Phones started at exactly 8 am.  Kept  up with calls throughout the day.
good,"Sales/Service"
good,My time at Comerica was typical everything was on timed schedule and that help keep the organization within the workplace. Deliveries and or pickups was very important
good,Management is always on your back asking you about cold calling. They are micro managers as well. No one gets into banking to basically have someone follow them around all day not trusting if they are getting their work done.
good,"Working at Comerica was akin to work with family.  everyone worked together as a team to achieve goals and to achieve client expectations.  At the time, IT systems and technology was not in line with other organizations.  Overall great company to work for."
good,A typical work day is to review the loans that are in process and process them as you receive all items needed to close the loan. New loan are assigned daily
good,It's an ok place to work. Management wasn't the greatest. It takes a lot to advance and they don't train well. It's an stressful environment and you can't truly be yourself.
good,"As an Assistant Manage, you are basically required to run the branch plus you have all the duties of a personal banker.  That means along with your managerial work, you must still answer calls, take customer traffic, and other account maintenances.  This can be a hectic workplace depending on the level of traffic at a given branch."
good,I do not recommend Comerica for anyone aspiring for vertical movement in their career. Management does not take the necessary steps to invest in either their employee's development nor have they kept pace with the marketplace in general as far as technology.
good,This company could be great to work for if some of the managers and the district manager had better training and management skills.
good,Fun place to work but no chance of becoming permanent employee. There is a 80 percent contract employee basis at the Auburn Hills location.
good,"Nothing else to say, just sick of seeing the company name when I am searching for a new career. I have nothing more to add, Good bye."
good,"Lowest paid financial institution. I learned a lot about banking when I started working for this company, I credit it all to the Assistant Managers."
good,A semi-large regional bank with a primary focus on relationships with an overall good management team.  The bank is trying to catch up to the analytics curve but can be rather difficult at times due to the fact analytics is a rather new area for the bank as a whole.
good,"I have worked at the company for nineteen years in a few positions. I have gained invaluable knowledge with each job. I currently balance a government program. The work is challenging yet rewarding as I am able to utilize core skills. I use problem-solving, analytical, critical thinking, decision making, and balancing skills. Every day presents new obstacles to be resolved. I work well with management and my co-workers. I have trained and cross-trained existing and incoming co-workers."
good,Overall experience was great.  I learned how to be extremely resourceful and build working relationships with people in different states over the phone and online.  I enjoyed the working environment and the people.  Enjoyed working on committees and coming up with new solutions.  Hardest part of the job was lack of training and upward mobility.  Management was always available to discuss matters and work with you if there were issues.
good,A typical work day consist of logging into phones to take incoming wires or customer inquiries or making out going wires to confirm Updated customer wire agreements and processing incoming fund into customer accounts.
good,Work at Comerica is what you make it. Just know when they say customer service it means SALES.
good,A typical day at work
good,"Great place to start a career in the financial industry. The company offers internal advancement and growth. Excellent culture, motivation and skills for success."
good,This company is great from someone straight out of college. Great opportunities to move around and learn in different units. The raises for promotions are not that great but overall a good company to build your resume with.
good,I would still be working there had I not been laid off due to budget cuts. Comerica was good company to work for however many days were stressful due do the aggressive sales culture.
good,My job is a reliable and safe work place. I currently do data entry . I have been employed here for 17 years and customer satisfaction takes priority in my job.
good,I have not worked here in awhile but when I was there some staff was good. Can be a stressful work environment dealing with upper management and the stress to get accounts due to very little marketing of the bank.
good,Great place to start a career if you are into sales and commission
good,Providing Service for clients through the mainframe and server support..
good,"The benefits and pay have been really great. I also like that they try to promote from within so you can really work your way up if you’re determined. Every job has challenging people who don’t pull their weight and I wish that management would step in and deal with that but I guess everybody’s so scared of getting sued so we just have to deal with these people and hope we don’t get in trouble for their mistakes. My other big challenge is having upper management shoving sales goals down our throats that don’t match up with our market. I don’t like harassing customers about loans that they don’t need. Making them aware, sure. But when they say no, leave them alone."
good,Very busy and you learn what role your job play to  get the job done. At the end of the day pull together and was able to laugh and pick a day to change the environment for fun.
good,Comerica Bank is a good company to work for if you're hired in the proper role. They have some of the nicest people I've ever worked with. Employees at Comerica really care about their customers and focus on relationship banking versus just opening accounts. The Comerica culture is outstanding however career advancement is not often available.
good,"customer service, compliance, operations, loans etc..lots of cold calling to build rapport and gain more sales. Monday and Friday calls regarding the weeks focus and than a debrief call"
good,"Customer Care/ Corporate Banking/ Project Finance 		 Project Management/ Financial Accountability/ Analytical/ Office Administration/ Due Diligence/ Relationship Management          Decision Making/ Time Management/ Business Administration Problem Resolution/ Leadership/Management/ Streamline Department/ Coach/Mentor/ Planning/ Verbal/Written Communication/ Problem Solving	/ Organizing 	"
good,The compensation was good overall for the banking industry.
good,"I really learned alto working for Comerica. Working for Comerica show me as a teenager how to balance my money, write a check & to be organized."
good,I was employed and laid off from Comerica as a complete shock. It was so unexpected because they had just done major lay offs 6-9 previously to my lay off and was guaranteed job security. Too many branches have closed and they are very outdated when it comes to technology.
good,Comerica is a great bank to work for when you are working with a great team. It has up and down but most banks do. I will tell anyone to come and work for Comerica.
good,"It was a nice place to work! Overall I enjoyed my time there! The employees were nice, and we're always willing to help whenever needed. The company does a good job making sure your prepared and knowledgeable of all products before proceeding to the call floor. I would work for this company again."
good,"Various positions, from Teller to Business Analyst"
good,"Waiting on customer of all diversity, enjoy assist people with there needs.  The hardest part is not being about to meet the sales goal's. I enjoy waking up to have a job to come to."
good,"Comerica seems to want us to constantly contact customers about products/cold call/promotions.  Most everyone who want a credit card cant have one, everyone who can have one do not want one.  It is also hard to sell products against other banks who have much better products and advertising."
good,"A typical day involved overseeing the Bank tellers and money within the vault. I would oversee the teller's personal drawers and dealt with customer issues on a daily basis. "
good,"If you have good management and a busy branch, it can be a great place to work.  If your branch is slow, you are pressured to create sales constantly.  There is way to much gossiping between management throughout the branches."
good,Very structure bank. Corporate world. Lots of different systems to learn.
good,"Lots of good programs in place, great diversity and community volunteer culture. Very conservative environment. "

good,"I worked here 10 years. It was a great place to work till the regional died. I learned a lot here. Great management, investment personal and employees. The people here know what they are doing. Company is well organized."
good,"The job itself was enjoyable and productive."
good,CMA is changing and evolving as most  organizations do. Management is learning and will move the Company into the next phase of success. Progress is a bumpy road.
good,"I had the opportunity to open up DeNovo branches with zero deposits and zero clients it was a thrill to know that i completed my goal with in 18n months and got to the green meaning success built a branch fro scratch clients, deposits, grand opening, hired my own staff, brought in my own clients. awesome feeling."
good,"Turnovers are out of control, expectations are different once you start. Great health insurance, paid vacation and lots of paid holidays off. If you are good in sales got for it."
good,I work in the Trust Real Estate Division of Comerica Bank Wealth Management. I enjoy the work environment and coworkers.
good,"I worked with wonderful tellers and bankers. I learned how to deal with a lot of responsibility and to wear lots of hats. I supervised the tellers, bankers and was responsible for all banking operations. I was also in charge of all sales goals as well. I really enjoyed my team and the pay was awesome."
good,"Pros: "
good,"Working here as a central vault teller, you did the same thing, you take in money and you put out money. I did move up to be an Operations Specialist eventually but felt the compensation wasn't in par for the area I worked. I honestly felt they just used salary based off HQ's standard of living in Detroit"
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with at Comerica. Our department was a tight knit group that gradually grew as the bank expanded its operations in California.
good,Loved banking was a major transition from a teller to Analyst. I was able to climb the corporate ladder and use the company tuition reimbursement to get my degree in Business Administration.
good,"Most IT projects & operational processes are documented & reviewed.  Application, IT infrastructure, and project/PMO are fairly well structured & applied."
good,The mailroom department was fast paced and fun. I made a lot of new friends from my helpful co-workers.Management was very clear about their objectives.
good,It was a great workplace with many opportunities for advancement. I was with the company for 18 years. My colleagues were very friendly and we work well as a team.
good,"Ive been at comerica for about 7 years now. I started as a teller and have worked my way up and switched locations once. It's a great place to work, great benefits."
good,"If I could leave anything or say anything about this company it would be that, I am underpaid for my current role with the company according to the companies policy."
good,"As the years went by... now they only use contractors, offshore and young people... Fortunately I kept my skills current and my finances intact. And I got a buy out and I'm all done NEEDING to work, no I want to do it for the challenge!"
good,We've banked with Comerica for four years. We own our home outright as we paid cash for it. We have a small 400K per year business. Comerica lied to us and deceived us. We immediately researched and found a small community bank and have left Comerica to their very Trump styled business. They are simply dishonest and self-serving. Despite their crafty commercials...
good,"Not a place to grow quickly or learn skills to grow within the company. The pay is great, but not the place for someone who is attempting to stay with a company to retire from."
good,Started with the transition of Manufactures Bank to Comerica Bank. I had been in banking previously and this was a big jump in the size of bank that I came from.
good,"Comerica was a great company to work for. The only downside about working for the company in the San Diego area was that they do not really have a large presence yet. There was a lot of downtime, and the company ""suggested"" you go to networking events outside of work on your own time to gain business. Very ethical and diverse which I loved, just hard to expand at times."
good,"Comerica has good benefits and a long tenured workforce.  The PTO bank is exceptional and most people are excellent to work with.  Operations are held in Michigan, Texas, Florida and California."
good,"Comerica has a long history of helping business owners find solutions to their financial struggles. An average day includes not only working my team within the banking center, but also doing outside business development."
good,"The people at Syntel are what make it so great. Everyone is extremely smart, helpful, and amazing to work with."
good,Good place but bad work life balance. You need to love what you do to work at the casino or you will be burnt out in a short time.
good,Great diverse company that promotes longevity with ample advancement opportunities. Work/life balance is also highlighted within the company creating good morale.
good,Nice team and support was really good from Client in understanding business. Place with fun environment with lots of room to grow our skills.
good,"Fun workplace, employees very friendly and pay was good. The hardest part of the day was working 12 or more hours a day. Management wasn't there all the time but we managed."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, linited room for growth on the wealth management side."
good,Very nice place to work enjoyed day to day work and the customers great co workers and good learning experience. after a while work can get boring and repetitive. Sale new products and services to customers is required and helps make the day more interesting
good,It was great just like a big family I just had to part ways to look for full time employment. They treat every employee just like family.
good,High production with accuracy and speed.  High degree of inclusion and diversity.  Co-workers were very professional and team oriented.
good,Energetic workplace with terrific co-workers where I've learned a great deal personally and professionally.
good,"Steady Work Flow"
good,"a customer service oriented job, cash handling, balancing, sales."
good,"Great work environment, wonderful training program. Fast paced and challenging work keeps you busy and evolving."
good,Working with some great people was one of the most rewarding parts of working with Comerica Bank.
good,"Great company, great people to work with. There is more time in the day to really sit down with customers to get to know them and what there needs are."
good,"Good staff of hard working individuals, working together to exceed client expectations, sales goals, and team success."
good,I enjoyed almost 6 years with Comerica Bank. I had a large clientale and I took my job seriously.
good,Answered calls all day. Management was great also had great co-workers. The hardest part of the job was that a little bit of sales had to be used and I was not accustomed to that. he most enjoyable part was knowing that customers were satisfied.
good,"All my customers and co workers are awsome, get along with everyone at work"
good,"Conduct field audits to examine A/R to determine the collateral base for loan purposes. Audits were performed at auto industry, health care and marketing firms."
good,"Training new employees and other officers, meeting the various type of clients and learning new task was the most enjoyable part of this company"
good,"Did daily transactions on a teller line. Managed the cash vault. Worked with employees on the teller line and helped them order cash, schedule vacations & daily lunches and breaks."
good,"I was working in the million dollar plus side of the banking industry.  I witnesses first hand how other people live and make money.  "
good,"Extremely fiscally conservative financial institution."
good,Currently a typical day for me is spreading financial statements for both car dealerships and personal financial statements for any owners/co-borrowers. I prepare risk ratings and loan recaps for deals that are being processed in the department for our clients and prospects. 
good,While working at Comerica I learned new things everyday about finances.
good,The manager was the worst. She frequently criticized employees in front of both customers and fellow employees.
good,A typical day at Comerica Bank usually would consist of;
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced.  The hardest part of the job is that, like many other companies, Comerica is very lean.  This leads to not always having enough people to do the work.  Comerica is very focused on the bottom line, which has helped the company turn around in recent years, but is also very stressful for employees."
good,Depending on which branch you are at will depend on if you enjoy working here or not. All management is a bit different. Turn over can be very high which is handled poorly and puts undue pressure on employees.
good,"This is a nice place to work. The training wasn't very good. It seems they stuck me with a trainer that was swamp with a lot of work."
good,"Worked at Comerica for two years. The only option for advancement in this company is if someone retires or dies. Always understaffed, but always passing over qualified candidates to leave space for the young pretty blonde girls."
good,"Take this review with a grain of salt because I worked there from 2012-2013, so I'm sure things have changed. I worked in a stand-alone, retail-banking location in Dallas. We focused primarily on opening credit and HELOC accounts. Back then, sales goals seemed steep and I frequently found myself cold calling a list of clients I had never met. In the end, there were many questionable sales tactics I observed (and took part in) and ultimately quit because I was tired of pushing products on people that I knew they didn't need or, in many cases, couldn't afford."
good,"The time I was employed there, we went through many different employees and management. Comerica is a great company to work for but don't get stuck doing the same thing for a long time."
good,"I was employed by them for over 30 years, Like every job, has its ups and downs. I learn a lot about information systems, as well as how to deal with change, and adversity.I am currently retired from them."
good,During my time at Comerica Bank I was able to focus on my customer's  needs and provided  sleep opportunities . I  was also able to learn different  aspects  of retail  banking along with banking regulations.
good,"Stable company until recent issues. Good chance for advancement,good benefits.  Heavy work load but interesting and varied work. Long retention among employees is common."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job are my clients."
good,Provided a fair income with limited promotional opportunities.  Hard to maintain a work/life balance at a non-management level.
good,"This company has ups and downs like any other. The do promote from within and give people a chance to grow. Typical day is an 8 hour day, and as manager there is so much they are responsible for, from operations to sales."
good,"Good benefits.  Not too many customers, but not too many employees as well.  Good job environment but they are downsizing the number of workers.  They are trying to systematize all the bank operations."
good,I would open new accounts verify accuracy and compliance guidelines. I also set up trades for Broker Dealer (Mortgage Backed Securities) to settle and exchange newly issued assets. I learned about the heavily regulated world of Trust. It was a team environment.

good,"I am an Admin for the VP of banking call center, we have 7 Superviors and 2 Team leads I help manage, the work enviroment is like a big family, great people that I work with. I get along with all of my coworkers and I am here for them when ever they need me. I enjoy helping others and like when we hit goal, I cheer them on and each agent."
good,"Exceptional work life balance. Leadership does try to separate life from work."
good,"Enjoyed my work and the people I worked with"
good,"With constant reorganizations and restructuring of the company, the moral is very low because you're wondering if your job is the next to be eliminated"
good,"Very underinvested in technology, especially on the Retail side, and is now scrambling to catch up.  Very much a business bank (its focus, loans, profits, etc.)  I enjoy working for my manager and the department I'm in."
good,its a good place to start in banking because its a smaller business bank where you get to know the clients. Its slow pace and not as fast as a bigger bank.
good,"The department I was in was very busy not enough people.  "
good,"I learned a lot, I meet a lot of great people who became like family.  I enjoyed my position there it taught me about being disciplined and taking ownership."
good,"Great place to work , multicultural community is very adoptive to everyone."
good,"You are on the phone all day helping customers with their problems, I have a monthly sales goals and daily referral goal, Also you are expected to offer on every call. Management is great, and it is a great place to work however if your sales goal is not met you eventually are laid off."
good,"A lot of change since I got here, including 3 bosses just for my lower level position. But coworkers here are great and we have good rapport with each other."

good,"a. relatively flexible work time (less discipline)"
good,Pay is higher than most other retail banks and the customer centered culture is a breath of fresh air. Products are and services are sub-par
good,I am able to work on my own and also can communicate with my coworkers if a problem arises. I have learn how to analyze problems.The hardest part in my current job is stress level. Not enough employees to do the work. Do like the work it is different every day something new.
good,"I liked working for the bank because you are your own manager in many ways.  Everyday was a different adventure, some days were fast pace and some were slow.  Most of the time, you will get along with everyone and lastly usually Fridays were dress down days."
good,"The culture is relatively old and fairly stuck in its ways. The people are great, the work/life balance is great, but it's not a company as modern or forward thinking as others in Detroit (ie. QuickenLoans)."
good,"Very competitive sales culture. Meet and greet customer.  Uncover customers banking needs.  Open accounts, solve banking problems, upsell other product and services. Audit tellers.  Cash management. The hardest part of the job was making the required sales quota.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting a diverse group of people."
good,"Very fast paced company, learned many different strategies to complete tasks in a timely manner."
good,Day consisted of taking a large amount of inbound calls. Calls ranged from balance inquiries to Possible theft of accounts. I was privileged to learn all bank laws and way to keep customers as well as my self safe from ID theft. I worked with some great people and many of them are still friends to this day. Some of the challenges were trying to explain how processing a check is different from a card. I found a lot of joy helping people who had ID theft or just trouble with there account.  
good,Career opportunities are limited only by you.
good,"Comerica's regulatory compliance guidelines require employees to be adept to change. In most cases , that keeps the environment very busy with new skills to learn monthly."

good,"The bank offers good customer service."
good,"Great environment. Loved the people. No drama with the coworkers. "
good,At the time we were just beginning check processing so the whole process was new to all of us.  Long hours due to the whole learning curve of the process.

The management was supportive and worked around my school schedule. The most enjoyable part was building relationships with customers and businesses that visit the bank frequently."
good,"This is a good place to work and they have a good work-life balance."
good,Over the past couple years that I've been working here I've learned many things that helps me to do my job well and go above and beyond. The most important thing I've learned is customer satisfaction. Management has been leading staff in guiding them to meet sales goals while making sure customers are the first priority. Co-workers are very helping in problem solving to find the best solution. The hardest part about the job is dealing with rude people while being positive. Best part about it is you meet many different people and get to help them with their financial needs.
good,"I loved the job security within the bank, however there was not a lot of room for advancement. But overall my years of working there were great, I would not have left if there was room for advancement."

good,"I enjoyed working for Comerica, until I was laid off after 14 years of service on 8/2010. The only complaint about Comerica is when your laid off/displaced the company will not try to place you back within the company, when positions are avaliable. I've applied for different positions within the company, especially in the departments I would assist in when help was needed, such as low staffed, or team meetings, and high call volume (etc.). Comerica would send you an email or dont even respond, stating the positions has been filled, and their still accepting applications on there website or other employment sites."

good,"Good place for women. New techniques approached to get a better work place. Good team work. Learning procedure through connect. Good management. I like to work here, but need more growth."
good,Plenty of opportunities for advancement mergers are key factors to long term employment.  Skills are transferable along with organizational skills. Many departments to transfer within and learn financial services.

An enjoyable place to work with all of the staff."

I learned it’s more than dealing with money it had a lot to do with selling a number of products and services.  You experience a vast array of customers who can have a variety of levels of banking.
good,Comerica provided a great first job to start my career.  The managers were great and I learned from them.  I was really able to develop good analytical skills
good,I enjoy working here would like more advancement opportunities  and pay increases.  The employees have been around a long time and enjoy their working environment
good,The in branch life was very stressful due to lack of staff and not having enough people to handle the more busy days.  Also the sales nature of the job did not allow for a enjoyable working environment.
good,The people I worked with was top notched.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their job duties.  The salary pay was a major asset for working there.  It was great to have an hour for lunch.
good,The work is pretty easy even though it can get really busy at times you have a boat load of co-workers there to help you get through whatever to get the job done
good,This job pays the bills. i mean it is just like any other teller job. Well they call it a Customer Service Rep. but it's a teller. The PTO offered was the best thing about working here.
good,"Good job and experience, especially out of college. The company has gone through many changes the last 12-18 months, most of them are  for the better."
good,Workplace culture is good. Comerica needs more professional people to join them for better progress in business for better competitiveness. I made progress when I work for comerica and comerica helped me relocated from taiwan to us. I really appreciate comerica very much.
good,"Great place to Work"
good,"At Comerica Bank, it's about you! Your ideas, spirit, vision and motivation - the great things you have to share are the things most valued at Comerica. When you join the company, you're encouraged to use your talents to help the customers, communities, shareholders and employees all achieve success. You're encouraged to embrace the core values that have empowered the company for  165 years - agility, collaboration, integrity, customer-centricity, excellence, involvement and diversity. Putting these ideas into action, helps  realize goals and so much more."
good,Comerica Bank is a great place to work.  Many of the employees at Comerica Bank have been there many years.  The typical work day is from 8 am to 5pm. Management is very approachable and understanding.  My colleagues and I have learned a great deal from each other.
good,"Comerica was an excellent company to work for during my 32 and a half years working there.  Unfortunately due to corporate downsizing and cost savings efforts, my position was eliminated."
good,"Fun professional work setting. I learned time management, budgeting money, and checks and balances. Clean helpful friendly mnagement"
good,Comerica Bank offers many career advancement opportunities if you are a hard worker and show your willingness to learn.
good,"Good place to work."
good,"Most days are predictable. You have your opening and closing procedures that slightly vary day to day. I was able to refine my customer service skills a bit more, learned how to uncover referral opportunities, and how to defuse upset clients during my employment at Comerica Bank. I had four different managers while there and they were all fantastic! They really went above and beyond to make the workplace enjoyable. Felt more like a family, than coworkers. They all preached to make the best of the day, regardless of what has happened, or what may happen. My entire team was the only reason I had stayed with Comerica for as long as I have. They truly are an incredible team. The hardest part would have been referring clients products. I tried, relentlessly, but the constant rejection can really be discouraging. Also, a lot of our clients were regulars. I have been there for a little over a year, and clients who I have formally introduced myself to when I was initially hired on, still don't know my name unless they glance my name tag or placard, and prefer the other workers over me. I'm not a difficult person. I'd like to think, and have been told time and time again, I am quite personable, but regular clients still would go out of their way to work with a coworker of mine. A few still re-introduce themselves to me as if we have never met before. My team was the most enjoyable part of the job. We would always have so much fun during our shifts. We'd make the best of everyday."
good,It is a good company to work for. They have a lot of structure. Almost too much structure. They need to revise their processes.
good,"Working for Comerica Bank has been the best decision for my career. It is a fast pace and very productive environment. So being an expert in sales is a plus. You could definitely learn a lot and grow within the company if you are good at sales and customer service combined. My co-workers are the best! They listen and take leadership in all the tasks I delegate. I wouldn't be as successful if it wasn't for an amazing team. Being a manager is a great role within Comerica, and you are able to partner with so many businesses in the community and business partners within the company. The best part about my job are the customers. Being able to meet new customers and help them with their finances, or any other issues that they may have, is so rewarding."
good,"I can honestly say that Comerica Bank is full of employees with integrity.  It is the only bank that gives federal regulators more info than they ask for because there is nothing to hide!  There were never any predatory lending practices, etc. during the recession.  It is a smaller bank, so there is opportunity to stand out and be recognized by executive leadership.  Because it is a great place to work, folks tend not to leave.  Therefore, there is only so much room for advancement beyond the VP level.  Lots of talented folks end up leaving because they want to advance their careers and there isn't always the opportunity to do so."
good,"I was worried when our office in Pleasanton was consolidated with the Walnut Creek office. The people were kind, helpful and lots of fun."
good,"Nice place to work. Pay is not competitive. Long term employment, room for advancement. Promotes growth both professional and personal. Would work there again."
good,Management are pretty caring and work loads are manageable.  Company have very good benefits and pay - most of the employees have been there for a very long time and for the most part moral is very good.
good,"Is a great place to work, multi cultural and employee, excellent benefit packages and incentives for their employees."
good,The work day was 8 am-5 pm.  The Auburn Hills campus is beautiful with a walking path outside.  Management varied by which department you were in.  Co-workers were great overall and a team atmosphere existed.  The pay was lower being financial.
good,"Taking care of customer's needs and always keeping the positive attitude which makes my job succesful. I've learned a new thing everyday honestly there's just too much to learn in a year which is how long i've been here, managements are good support, the thing i love the most are our meetings and its because they bring everyone to the floor and ask for opinions and their way of thinking which it shows MDA at work."
good,Starting off in HR at Comerica was a good place to start a career.  I worked with so many great people and learned so much about customer service and human resources.
good,"If your looking for a stable strong bank then Comerica is it.  They pride them selves in customer service, and I found that the office I had the pleasure to work in, were the best in service.  Hilton rd. in Brighton,MI"
good,The normal typical days work. The teams work in a cohesive unit.
good,from working on the teller line to help manage the branch it was always a GREAT time at Comerica.
good,"•	Over 8 years experience in Business systems and process Analysis. "
good,"Staff meeting in the morning "
good,"good to work for... people have been there for many years and that says something about the company.  "
good,"Selling and paperwork are a typical day, although the bank has become heavy in cutting costs and consilidating department duties to the branch level, cutting down the time I can sell significantly. Most staff has been employed here for many years, but I see a move toward a younger and newer workforce. Management is also moving towards a newer and younger philosopy in my opinion for the better. Hardest part of job is juggling between sales and operations, the bank seems to be stuck in the old ways while trying to keep up with the bigger and faster paced banks and the technology they have and provide. Seems like technology is not the strong point here. Most enjoyable part of the job is the challenge and customers."
good,"typical banking environment, daily contest to make it fun, good healthy relationships, fast paced"
good,"Comerica Bank expects their employees to have energy and an eye for detail! It is a close-knit environment with friendly coworkers. My favorite part about the job was getting to know the small businesses in my city. Just remember, this is a bank and you need to be good with money!"
good,Good company to work for
good,"I enjoyed management, he worked hard to get the most for his immediate employees. Company was great with stock options, 401K. Benefits were greats and time off was superb"
good,"Comparatively, this was the best bank job.the salary for the retail bank was very good.  Vacation was great!  I would love to return . I can’t speak for the new management group but from 2006-2012 it was the best"
good,You always know what you need to do when you come into work. Things change frequently in the departments I have worked in but they make it clear when changes are made.
good,Working for CMA for 2 years. Not many compliants. Do your job with integrity and thoroughly. The work environment is relaxed for the position I am in. Onsite café (can be expensive after a while) Lots of diverse programs to become involved in.
good,"Great team environment.  Motivational contests with other branches or other team members.  Great opportunities to learn new processes and new jobs, great on promotions from within."
good,Great work environment but for a college degree holder not enough pay. If you love sales then you will love working here. Sales goal are high but they will give you the tools to succeed.
good,"good place to work, keeps you busy all the time, but have very good work life balance, good work culture, good people and management. Management is always supportive"
good,"I would process checks for companies and do data entry per their instructions on their account.  I was also making sure other clerks were doing their job correctly, You had to have great quality and productivity in your work."
good,"Compensation is higher than most banks. Small bank feel. Positions where changed during GEAR UP, and more responsibility is placed onto the bankers.  They still offer Pensions, 401k and decent incentives. A typical day is usually making calls over different things. I learned how to treat customers as individuals. Management is often Micro Managed and it is passed down, between calls, conference calls, emails, and huddles it is a little distracting. I enjoy the customers and co workers."
good,"I have been with the bank for almost 13 years. I have to say I have worked with a wonderful group of mangers. They all have been understanding and very family-oriented. I am always learning in the position that I am in. I can honestly say I learn something new almost every day. "
good,"Will love to work for Comerica again"
good,"Great company to work for. Allows you to train and learn new jobs."
good,"Banking center wise, everyone is very pleasant to work with. I've encountered the most uplifting people here. As a small company, there is room for improvement, but overall its a lovely place."
good,I liked working with Comerica because it was good company and had great benefits and friendly management. I had great customers and loved working with them.
good,Comerica is a very good company to work for.  They have great regard for the colleagues who are employed with the organization and truly strive to make customer service a top priority.
good,"worked for Comerica almost 5 years.  My immediate management staff was amazing,   Worked with some of the greatest people I have ever met and I learned all my banking skills from my managers.  I was always included in decisions and felt a sense of worth."
good,"Good, stable place to work.  Great work/life balance - lots of vacation and holidays.  Also have alternate work schedule available with every other Friday off. "
good,"A typical day would be to check your emails to see what promotions are going on for that week or month. Taking a customers deposit or withdraw slips. Opening new accounts (Checking, CD's, Savings, etc.) and closing accounts as well. What I learned is how transactions occur. What it means when a bank puts a hold on your funds. When you make a deposit, depending on dollar amount, how long it takes to show up in your account. The hardest part of the job is to tell someone they do not have enough funds to make their withdraw. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you give information to a customer that have never heard before or no knowledge of that can make their lives a little better and more convienant."
good,"Managed a team of 6 at the branch in both sales and operations. Daily routine was composed of a pre-opening huddle to detail what needed to be done, and who was going out on business calls, or where they were in their account achievement, loan closing, telemarketing, and compliance test."
good,I really like the bank and its culture. Its a established bank since 1849.

good,Great learning environment with understanding and involved management. I started my professional career and spent six years learning how to underwrite loans. It is a great company with great team members and a focus on collaboration.
good,"I have been gone for 13+ years, but when I worked there I had no complaints. My job was managing a branch team and working with clients of the bank.  I helped clients with any financial needs that they required, and tried to cross-sell them additional banking products.  I was also responsible for the branch's profit and loss.  I was a trainer for upcoming tellers and managers at the bank."
good,"I describe a typical day at Comerica as BUSY. There was always work to do. I learned a lot dealing with customer service, managing vendor relationships, quality assurance and control and banking in general. I worked with a diverse group of great people and learned a lot from them. The hardest part of the job but yet enjoyable was resolving difficult problems in the testing realm. It was enjoyable because you always learned something different."
good,"Day starts with status call of previous day and task to be accomplished for the day, Goes on with allocation of task to team and review of clarifications, KT to the team if required, execution of test-cases, logging defects, Mid status from the team.The main thing i learnt is how to manage time besides all these.Enjoyable part is all my co workers and manager are very flexible and we had a good team support."
good,"We paved the way for a successful national sales platform.  When I re-joined Comerica, Michigan, Texas, Arizona, California and Florida were all doing Commercial Card Sales via their Treasury Management Sales people in the local offices.  My position was created to standardize the delivery of the product in those markets.  The Commercial Card sales specialists in California, Texas and Michigan then reported to me.  "
good,"Typical day included planning events and forecasting, learned how effectively communicate with all lines of business. My co-workers were very supportive and worked as a team to accomplish goals."
good,Management is always willing to help you work to the next level. Co-workers have no issues with lending a hand when in need.
good,Great place to work with great leaders that teach you the value of relationship among a valued company and its clients.

good,Commercial credit training program which is at the top of the industry. Flat management structure gives you good visibility to top management and opportunity to advance quickly if you perform.
good,I loved working at Comerica. They did what they could to take care of you and make sure you were good. At times there were staffing issues but that’s at any job honestly. They made sure to pay you mileage if you went to another location and you could also get extra hours if you wanted to and it was a business need.
good,The International department was a very diverse group of people and I learned about the different cultures.  They depended on me to keep the area running smoothly.
good,"Comerica is a 'big bank', and as such can provide a stable work environment with good pay.  I haven't worked there since 2004, so I may not be the best to write this review.  However, I did work there for 12 years, and the environment provided a lot of room for advancement, and I did advance."
good,"Each person was responsible for cash handling (cashing checks, making deposits, withdraws) we also responsible for up-selling bank product."
good,"I had a very wonderful career with this company. My group was very productive and it was a very good team of people to work with. Average work day, was able to learn something new almost weekly, my manager was great, managing people and work hours."

good,"Comerica Bank is an excellent place to work to develop a variety of skills. Cash handling, customer focus, sales, multitasking, and being proactive was all the skills needed on a day to day basis.  Being able to assist and meet the needs of a diversed background of clientele was a must.

good,"Productive and fun work environment. Effective communication with credit and management daily, given the credit committee approach to investments."
good,"A typical day at work started at 5am processing payments for different accounts. I learned how to process hospital accounts, city taxes, health insurance, car notes, apartment complexes, and many more. Management to me did not work as a team. My co-workers and I were like family, we attended each others weddings, birthdays, baby showers etc. and some of us are still in contact. The hardest part of that job was working so called overtime on one day but the next day going home early because of the overtime the day before. My problem with that is, as a part timer with only 15-24hrs in a week, staying over was never overtime for us. The most enjoyable part of that job was my co-workers, we worked as a team to get the job done."
good,"Comerica is a good place to work.  Over the years, I've been able to take advantage of flexible hours and working from home. The benefits (PTO time, health care) are pretty decent and in line with most big companies.  The yearly merit increases, however, are low and not keeping up with inflation."
good,"A typical work day is filled with duties and responsibilities. Learning was very easy for myself do to the knowledge I had in the department I work.  Management may be flexibility and understanding to the need of the employee, you may have one bad apple in the bunch it does not spoiled the whole bunch. The hardest part of the job was getting all employees to work as hard as you may have. I enjoy the conversation we had as a group with all employees the good and the bad makes a good balance and a great group of people to work with."

good,"Good company to work for they like to volunteer a lot to help out the community, and reward us with awards to show appreciation. "
good,"A day in the office is quite bland. Assisting customers with their banking needs and offering information to better their lives."
good,"Comerica Bank was a good company. They started restructuring and as a result many employees were asked to retire early or being laid off.  Comerica Fl is wealth management. They have an office in Fort Lauderdale, which is the only office south. None in Miami Dade county"
good,Long term position through Kelly Services was a very good opportunity to learn banking software and how commercial credit cards work. Exposure to different projects allow me to experience more that one area of banking.
good,"If you want to grow and learn, this is your place. It can be challenging, but it is rewarding if you at least try. Stay positive and always ask questions."
good,"This company will not cheat you on your value. Employees are compensated based on ability, and  management responds well to requests for more money or more responsibility. A typical work day begins at 830AM and ends at 515PM. Self-starting initiative is required for this location, as is detail orientation and overall organization. The most enjoyable part about this job will be your coworkers. The least enjoyable aspect of this job will be the self-entitled, wealthy and obnoxious consumers that you'll deal with. Patience is key."

good,I was a full time employee and generally enjoyed my job.  Management could at times be a little overbearing but as long as you are meeting your goals you are fine.
good,"I worked for Comerica as a Relationship Banker II at the 20th St & Camelback location prior to and through its grand opening event. The company provided great support, though training and assimilation were a bit lacking, and their technology lags the bigger players in the industry. Management seems to have a good idea of successful coaching and sales practices. When I left (for another banking position much closer to home), they were moving toward the same sales model as the big banks (the DM was former Chase, so that makes sense). What this means for tellers, bankers and customers at Comerica is that soon they'll be treated just like they are at Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Shame. They were off to a great start!"
good,Not too many bad things about Comerica the work can be repetitive but overall a great working experience. Strict demands at times systems well in need of upgrade challenging goals given especially when the products don't have the greatest benefits
good,Was a great place to work. The team leaders were awesome. We had weekly meetings to let us know the good things were doing and the things we needed to work on. I met a lot of great people there and made some new friends. Being a temp employee I didn't receive any holiday pay or have any health insurance benefits.
good,"Best years of work were at Comerica Bank. Great culture, learned a lot about quality customer service. Management was excellent. The hardest part of the job was leaving the job t take care of sick child."
good,I enjoyed working here. But I want to grow more in Banking and finance department. So I am taking my next step and would like to join new institution for my personal and company's growth where I can use all of my skills.
good,"I was start out with proof operator, and became trainer on the side.  I was also correction clerk.  It was very good experience to start the first job."
good,I enjoyed working for comerice bank but the compensation is low. The senior employee try to help and advice the new employee. I established very good relation ship with all level of employee.
good,"A very different place to work with, employees are very nice and treated each one the same, culture and nature of works are always busy and challenging. Overall a nice company."
good,"When I worked for Comerica Bank over eight years ago, was a good place to be."
good,"answer calls, account balances, stop payments, overdraft fees, closing cards, sales opportunities. assisting customer with investigations, ordering new cards"
good,I learned a lot of skills working here. This is where I developed into the skilled professional that I am today. I have had exposure to many project opportunities and amazing managers.

good,"Very nice culture, outstanding management.  I have no complaints and would have worked their for the rest of my career had the economy allowed me the opportunity."
good,I enjoyed my jobs at Comerica meet some nice people and bad.  I have been in banking for quite sometime and would love to get back in.  My managers where nice especially when they recommended me to become a Teller Supervisor.
good,A great company to work for with unlimited room for advancement. Benefits are standard. Salary is very comparable to other financial institutions. Comerica also have excellent volunteering and community activities.
good,"Comerica was a great place to work. The benefits were outstanding. There was opportunity for advancement, but I enjoyed part time hours while my children were young. "
good,"great customers, management is great. you will learn a lot about customer service. Advancement is rare. A lot of sales. not a lot of branches is California."
