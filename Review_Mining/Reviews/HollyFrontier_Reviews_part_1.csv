rating,review
bad,"Workplace culture has turned toxic over last two years. Previous stable IT management completely gutted, now remaining staff leaving in droves. Formerly stable company & workplace is now political & back-stabbing."
bad,Just overall terrible management. Worked there for a year and clearly they don't seem to care about employees. Just really poor and I really don't regret getting laid off.
bad,"No culture, no diversity, people would overstep boundaries by looking into personal lives of coworkers. You had to be in the ""in crowd"" to be promoted. Managers only spoke to certain people."
bad,Frontier oil for a corporation was a good place and good people to work with good pay and benefits. Mangement staff was not fair. To all the employee s
bad,I wished I could say something positive about HollyFrontier Company but the only thing I can say is that the company does pay well. I worked 14 months trying to make the company successful using all years of experience and skills but I was treated like a outside and most of the management team players didn't want me there.
bad,"I've been an employee in the Engineering group for 4 years and the first two were fantastic.  These last couple of years I've had no development from my superiors, I've had to research to build my own skills.  Nepotism is a major problem at this facility, if you know the right people you'll advance.  They could be a great company if they had backbone and performed like a corporation."
bad,Black women have a hard time going forward in this company.  There is little improvement given to the black women. Low regard for black women. No blacks
bad,they are trying hard to be very structured and matured in certain areas which give a ton of opportunities in terms of maturing the process to technologies they have
good,"Leadership is not held accountable for un ethical behavior. No diversity or inclusion initiatives, leadership is not held accountable for bad behavior."
good,Very friendly environment with coworkers. However my experience with management did not go well. Rules were followed but extremely bent to end in my termination
good,"This company has a lot of potential to be great but the Executive Team is disjointed and not all the leaders are on the same page. CEO is great and culture is getting better. Support functions struggle; rampant favortism and good ol boy club practices in corporate. Your experience can vary depending on department and location. If hiring and promotion practices focused more on talent, and a few bad apples would leave, it would be an awesome place to be."
good,"I only Worked at that site for 5 weeks as a contractor to help start up their crude oil unit that had burned down."
good,"I am a former employee of 10 years. If you're a single, tail kissing, individual who is willing to work endless hours then this is the place for you. In Tulsa, overal the management is horrible and demands production no matter if the job is done safely or not. I personally witnessed a significant injury on equipment that had been written up several times. There are many good people located at the Tulsa refinery but the management is very very poor."
good,great work to do. I work in the warehouse and the people I worked with was top notch and fun. Had poor management with mass confusion on how things should be run.
good,"A typical day of work is to come in check my emails. Answering business emails.   Start entering my run tickets. "
good,"chill place to work from what i remember, fairly new refinery compared to other plants i've been in so wasn't really much that needed repaired. didn't pay well at the time i worked there."
good,"They don't always advance based on experience, nor recognize the value of someone's self investment to grow. Over all the company its self is a solid company."
good,"Very fast pace, Only two women doing all of the data entry for the trucking company.  "
good,"I was at the Cheyenne Refinery and the transition with the merger was not as smooth and it could had been.  Poor communication from corporate created preventable issues."
good,HFC is a growing company that is expanding it's product line and global footprint. In it's veal to grow the IT systems is struggling to keep up with the demand. They have brought in new IT leadership hoping to attract new and younger employees. Overall the benefits are very good.

good,small company growing larger. needs vast improvement in technology and procedures.
good,"Good people, great location, ability to work 9/80...it's your typical office job. Not much excitement in the office. Very traditional and outdated. The work isn't hard but can be challenging."
good,"Competitive workplace with a good group of employees, that are willing to go the extra mile to make things safe and productive for the company."
good,Great atmosphere with peers and lots attention to detail in engineering groups. People are professional and friendly. Compensation is below average for industry. Benefits and work life balance is great.
good,"HollyFrontier is a good company to work for. they are growing day by day. The team is really eager to build and better the systems all the time, although management bottlenecks the growth at times."
good,I spent nine years at HF as a plant operator. It is a great place to work and the management was usually very supportive. The pay is excellent but plan on giving your soul to them. The expectations are high but they provide all the tools you need to achieve them. This is a company in constant transition so things change weekly but I feel that most everyone wants you to succeed. I really miss the place but had to move on.
good,I was contracted in to work. Absolutely great place to work. I enjoyed every day I went to work there. I would tell anyone I meet to work here. Great place!

good,Very good culture.  The people are skilled and politics are minimal.  The company is well managed and the personnel selection keeps the culture very positive.

good,"Wonderful fast paced, enjoyable, work environment working with well-trained co-workers to accomplish tasks completed timely, safely, and correctly."
good,"HollyFrontier is an excellent company and continues to expand their operations through timely and strategic investments.  In my time at HFC, I continued to grow and be challenged with the company.  HFC has always been open to new ideas and technology to continuously improve their processes along with their employees.  The hardest part of my job was finding time to implement standards as the company grew rapidly.  The most enjoyable part was the team problem solving and relationships within IT and customers."
good,It was expected that you answered all calls and made them short and to the point. Our calls were tracked. The manager was easy to get along with but very business like. He seem unapproachable at times but probably due to the nature of his job. I enjoyed most of my co workers and the duties of the job.
good,"Wonderful place to work! HollyFrontier gives you free reign with your projects.  "
good,I loved the environment at Holly (especially the West plant or the old Sun Co) but the time was cut short due to temp assignemtn being completed..
good,My time at the refinery was extremely eye opening for me.  Everything from my knowledge of construction and manufacturing to my work ethic was enhanced by the serious nature of the job.
good,"excellent company to work for. they hire well qualified personel, who reall know what they are doing with no suppervision required. makes everyones job easier"
good,HollyFrontier allowed me the freedom to decide how to provide reporting while meeting the needs of the company. My job responsibilities changed as the needs of the company changed.
good,Holly is a good company. although there's some things that need to change just like any place else it is still a good place to work. The pay can be better but it is still fair.

good,"A key member of the first line support ream for Hollyfrontier. Daily duties include, answering phones, resetting passwords in SAP, Active directory, empac and Datastream. Working on new hire requests, assisting the team with unassigned tickets from the queue. Outbound calls and emails for customer follow up to make sure requests have been completed and incidents have been resolved. I also remote to users pc to further assist in troubleshooting errors related to hardware or software. Also create ids for new employees."
good,"A typical day at Hollyfrontier could either be really hectic or extremely leisurely. The basic rundown was to check emails,respond in a timely manner and then continue with the daily duties. The duties included data entry of crude oil tickets, and working with spreadsheets. The most enjoyable part were the employees which always made the day go by fast. The least enjoyable was the amount of paperwork there would be at times."
good,HollyFrontier has great opportunities for anyone's future. Great health care benefits as well as dental. Pay is right with the market including nice bonuses. Workers are easy to get along with and in the HEP filed leadership was outstanding.
