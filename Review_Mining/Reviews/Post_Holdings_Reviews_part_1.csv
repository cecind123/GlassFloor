bad,"No air conditioning or air circulation in production.  very hot on the production floor not including the ovens."
bad,"The work environment is crushing, the management seems only concerned with themselves, worked Christmas however asked for to leave early 2 days prior, told that would be acceptable but when time came supervisor stated I had to stay so he could go so his Christmas instead. No respect and have to provide all forms of work material."
bad,The only good part of working for Post was the awesome people I got to work with. Since they never intended to keep the plant we never had a chance for advancement or learn new things. Basically  It SUCKED!
good,"I worked in the warehouse on third shift. I was the first and only woman that had ever been hired to do this type of job. It made me feel so happy for the women there when they'd come up to me and say ""It's so awesome we have a woman in the warehouse finally!""  The first shift warehouse person treated me horrible. He called me names like FB and SB.  I went to Human Resources about it everytime. Nothing was done. I talked to the plant manager. Nothing was done. I finally learned to shut my mouth and endure it until I found a different job. This is my last week with them. I was from day one treated differently because I was a woman in the warehouse. Doing what they considered a man's job and a lot of them didn't like that I did it just as good as they did. The coworkers on my shift for the most part were great. I will miss seeing them. Had it not been for all the harassment I enjoy working in a warehouse. Loading and unloading trailers. The ESL machine can be challenging to keep up with when a pallet is coming out every five minutes and you're expected to be doing five other jobs at the same time, but it makes an eight hour shift fly by. Management is HORRIBLE. Starting with the Plant Manager. When I started in 2014 I thought he was a great guy. Always asked people how they were doing. The longer I was there the less I saw him doing that. The Human Resource girl is one of those pretty nice girls... TO YOUR FACE, and only to your face. I've never talked to one employee that is happy with her and how she deals with things. Because she doesn't,. She is pure evil and will do whatever"
good,"The people are great.."
good,"Nice people to work with open 24 7 so you have to work holidays, lots of over time, union environment. easy to get to not much in the way of holiday parties, go to 2 12 hour shifts"
good,"It is a good place to work"
good,I enjoyed working on the production equipment.  The equipment is new and computerized.  A typical day at work was responding to trouble calls and performing preventive maintenance.  I learned more about food processing and GMP's.
good,"Overall, Post Holdings is a convenient and reliable place to work. I was able to take advantage of the opportunity to advance in the company from working in packaging to extrusion operation with increased pay benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great group of hardworking coworkers. A typical day is fast paced where you are making decisions in the moment. My coworkers and I depended on each other to complete the job to the best of our abilities. I learned a lot while I have been working as an extruder operator. I have learned how to control and monitor machines to produce specific ingredients. I am also in charge of quality testing. The hardest part of the job is working late nights. Overall, I enjoy the coworkers I spend my shifts working with and the opportunities they have given me to apply and receive two different promotions."
good,This was a temporary assignment that lasted about 9 weeks. The assignment was to help implement the roll out of new attendance policies.
good,it was a typical food industry job with its ups and downs. some days it is very busy and others it is slow with not much to do. Overall it is not a bad job.
good,Over all a really good experience. Company has a strong financial focus and takes good care of its employees. However it is a holding company so brands can be sold at any time.
good,"My time with Post was short (less than a year) but during that time the company was sportive in safety, process improvement, employee recognition, and great pay."
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my 22 years at Post Foods as I stepped through consistently increasing levels of responsibility. I have had the privilege of working with creative, talented, driven people to execute strategic initiatives contributing to business growth.  I am leaving because all the R&D positions in Battle Creek have been eliminated in the merger with MOM Brands effective between Sept. and Dec. 2015. An equivalent position will not be available in the new organization."
good,"Lots of overtime in a union shop. Good people to work with. Most of the managers are good people, but there are a few snakes in the grass. If I stayed in Battle Creek, I never would've left."
good,"This is a good place to work. Salary and benefits are great. Working 12 hour shifts are tiring, along with a rotating schedule."
good,Post Foods compensates very well and has excellent benefits.  The work/life balance is tough.  While I worked for the company we rotated 12 hours shifts.  Very difficult with young children.
good,Good work life balance. Provides employees with tools for learning on the job and workshop training. Productive and fun workplace. Has positive outreach to the community engaging employees in volunteer work with Habitat for Humanity and Morristown Soup Kitchen. Also provides employee's children annual exposure to corporate business operations. Celebrates monthly birthdays of employees for morale booster and better work productivity.
good,"Great environment to work, very challenging position and busy environment; but, people is friendly, flexible, respectful and understandable."
good,"Headquarters being relocated to Minnesota."
good,"I knew what was expected of me each day."
good,"Post Holdings actively cares about their employees.  They identify the strengths and opportunities of individuals and work with them to improve their skills and set them up for future advancement within the company.  They are constantly working to improve all aspects of the business - productivity and efficiency, food safety, personnel safety, etc."
good,"The place is  good but management is poor ,thatâ€™s while I am looking for another job and some people are also planning to leave.if management could try to get workers in it will be fine for the company"
good,It is great job for someone that does not mind working 12 hour rotating shifts. Good benefits and quarterly profit sharing.
good,Post Foods is a good place to work which still has family values and isn't overrun with corporate issues. A typical work day is meeting with coworkers discussing daily agenda and planning team work.
good,HR is solely for the company and thinks nothing of the employees.
good,"Was a temp right out of college.  Very fun place to work.  Modern atmosphere with awesome co-workers.  Was just a temporary job but if they had the position I wanted, definitely would have stayed."
good,"One of the best parts of my workday was interacting with my coworkers.  We would hold discussions about upcoming technologies and how we could incorporate them into our workload.  The hardest part of the job was that all my coworkers were located in St. Louis, MO.  Since I worked out of my home in Utah I would only get to see them in person once every couple of months."
good,"Corp big shots closed the plant, their loss.  Modesto Plant was a great place to work.  Corp politics at their best, no reason to close a plant that was successful and keep other plants open that are NOT in the USA!"
good,The worst part of working at post is the 12 hr swing shift. The best part is the team work. The management at post are supportive and helpful. I learned that coworkers are like family.
good,Clean work enviroment with good break times. Scheduling is a problem due to production requirements are not steady. There are a lot of layoffs and shift changes weekly. The wages are above average for the area of Niagara because its a union shop.
good,"Post Foods was an excellent company from both a leadership and culture perspective. I enjoyed both my work, co-workers, and leadership team.  Sadly the Post Foods merged with another company in 2015 and headquarters moved to Minnesota (from New Jersey)."
good,"I loved working in the Control room. I liked putting in data, and dealing with different people and areas through out the company. Fair in opportunity to advance."
good,"Post is a good company to start with. I have worked as intern over there, the culture was good. But i felt team was not so effective in communicating."
good,"A good place to work, where the culture is awesome. A place where people are always willing to help out.  getting an hour break was a plus as well."
good,"It was a joy to go to work, I mostly work in process ,and had a lot of different jobs, and alot of training. Management and co workers were great.Most of the jobs were interesting,for you were always learning something. I have nothing but the best to say about Post."
good,"I made $15.50 an hour at Post and it felt great. The hour were the down fall of the job, 12 to 16 hour days and I am a mother a five year old and in the middle of custody battle so I was unable to perform the way that I know I could while I was there."
good,"-Great opportunity to make a great product! "
good,wonderful place to work in that employees are self directed and given an opportunity to learn and get experience with areas of the business other than their principal job.
good,"Post Holdings is small company with a strong industry footprint in the marketplace. Great company for sonsumer brands."
good,"My job is busy, but we will still have fun.  I process my checks, then my orders and answer emails.  My co-workers are great and everyone gets along.  We do not have micro managers."
good,Not much room for growth. Management could use some help. Good place to work and hone skills in marketing and sales.
good,"Everyday was different - there were no typical days. I loved the constant change and growth"
good,Post Holdings is a great place to work for. They care about their employees and everyone is life family. We work hard and every department assist and making the next department better.
good,l worked for Post Holdings for a staffing agency and I learned so much.  They are compassionate and everyone is a team player.  I loved the culture of the workplace
good,"I enjoyed working for Post Holdings. Although the company did not stay open for an extended amount of time after I started, I enjoyed my time there."
good,"You are your own person and responsible for your own actions and work, but team work is still a key factor."
good,"Versatile, passionate, senior level sales executive, with extensive experience in the consumer packaged goods industry, delivering targeted results, improving return on sales and transforming businesses. Best part of my job is to Drive Sales and Profits."
