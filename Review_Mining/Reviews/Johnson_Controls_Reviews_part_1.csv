rating,review
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"The supervisor expects to be in the loop on every small step of the job that he has no idea of the means or purpose of tests. He does not have any training in the largest part of his field responsibility. The service manager cannot tell a customer ""no"" for fear of not making every last cent from them, even at the expense of his employees."
bad,"Não existe melhoria contínua, os mesmos erros são cometidos em todas as obras e alguns poucos precisam corrigir problemas deixados pra trás, quem sai da empresa pra corrigir problemas não consegue crescer e não tem nenhum tipo de benefício ou reconhecimento por resolver problemas que a própria empresa causou seja com vendas erradas, funcionários incompetentes em campo ou no gerenciamento das obras."
bad,The company is going through an identity crisis. The culture is toxic and no inclusive. Finding operational people to execute the work is few and far between
bad,"I hated going to work. It is a typical call center job. Honestly, I really wanted growth in this company but not that division of Johnson Controls Inc."
bad,"Where do I start? JCI is the worst company I have ever worked for. It's a cesspool of corrupt executives & board members, cowards against corporate mandates, and structures of power that would please any dictator. "
bad,They dont treat new employees well and they dont train new employees like they should.you will always be sent home when something on line breaks down however mino the issue is
bad,The worst thing about JCI is poor management. There are few management people in place at the Louisville branch. The ones that are in place are terrible to work for. They have no business being in management and that is the reason MANY employees have left the company.
bad,"Williston Vermont Office -- This is a very unprofessional office that lacks professional managers.  The management in this office have been there for years and have only kept their positions by lying and accusing employees of not doing their job properly so that they are not held accountable and look good.  There is constant verbal abuse and accusations from the managers and they get away with it because it is a remote office with little supervision from senior management.  The service managers do not have college degrees and are unable to problem solve and do not understand technology.   When faced with a problem that they do not understand, they blame the customer or the employee. They are all related through family and friends and favor one another making it difficult to voice an opinion without getting shut down if you are not part of their inner circle.  They are constantly looking for ways to take opportunities from sales or to overcharge the customers. It is the most unprofessional environment I have ever worked in.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this company!"
bad,"If are you looking for micro manager self low job & you like to snitch and be micromanage this is the perfect place for you. We started out in my class with 15 employees by the time 6 months came in  it was  only 3 of left from my class, by the time I left I was the only one left in my class. HR  reach out to me via email and wanted to know why I Left, but did nothing to change the toxic environment."
bad,One of the worst jobs I worked at. They have little to no communication and when they trained me they get attitudes with you if you not learning as fast they want you to they’ll send you out the door and tell you not to come back.
bad,"One week vacation and they treat CSA’s (dispatchers) like gold, technicians like the hired help...which we were, Union contract employees, not JCI employees. No pay over scale, no training, nepotism rampant. Great place for OJT to take to a mechanical contractor, whose pay and benefits package will make you feel appreciated."
bad,"they will move your job over seas, can you move departments before they eliminate your job? management will give you a bad review every review. i know this because worked in several depts, and its the same tacit. make you work harder and yet they find ways to find something wrong. then they will send that dept over seas.  "
bad,"There is not enough characters to describe working at Johnson Controls.No life work balance,Don’t care about employees in general,Management is horrible.I wouldn’t recommend nobody to work for this Idiots."
bad,"If you are a professional who works within teams and expects professionalism instead of politics, move along. JCI is a failing business with no future"
bad,"Terrible terrible  management ,managers lie they are deceitful and don’t care about you or your family ,worse place ever to work, be prepared to work 12 shifts the rest of your life including Saturdays and sundays, mandatory or they will fire you"
bad,Disorganized and fractured corporation. Partially because they never merged the three companies that make up Johnson Controls today… Somebody needs to provide some leadership here.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"Meslek etigine aykiri bir yonetim bicimi var. "
bad,No worklife balance. No avenue for growth as a 3d artist. Petty politics. People just talk about coworkers. And yes I am just venting out by typing it in all caps.
bad,"Management is terrible. "
bad,"Manager shawn is a racist , doesn't like black people and Spanish as well. He only take care white people,  never see a manager like shawn . Shawn don't have experience as manager,  never care for employees safety,  only care for productive,"
bad,Good job poor management makes for hostile work environment . Work week is not stable told you would work one time only for it to change by the day. No communication with employees.
bad,"Trainers were unprofessional , not worth the stress they put on you. Definitely would not recommend anyone to work there, they expect so much from you and one small thing you don't get right they get upset and start having attitudes with you and don't want to help with any questions you have. Bad experience"
bad,"This place is unorganized, staffed with people who know not what they are doing. They train you for 4 grueling weeks, dumping information that is confusing and excessive. They pay sucks. Some employees are making as low as $11-$12 an hour and have been with company for over 10 years. "
bad,"One of the worse jobs I have ever had, do not recommend anyone working there. They will lie to you during the interview process about have a work/life balance then expect you to work 24-7 with no days off."
bad,Dont think about applying for this sick job they lie on top of lies on top of lies. No communication from employees or management. Horrible hot place to work. If u last good luck. I will pray for you.
bad,"the department in which I worked is poorly managed, low moral and hostile. In addition to there not being adequate training provided to newcomers. I would not recommend working for company to anyone I know."
bad,I wouldn’t recommend this job if you aren’t good at kissing the supervisors behind . They’re not understanding of the hours you work vs real life situations. 12 hour shifts and could possibly be sitting around for hours. They allow you to sit down for hours but not fall asleep. The job is all about covering your tail and pointing the finger when something goes wrong
bad,"The company doesn't care about anything other than you being at work for 12 hours 6 days a week, sometimes 7 days a week. Home/work life balance is terrible. If you have a family this is not the job for you. Management is subpar at best and they show extreme favoritism.  I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone who wants a life outside of work because it is almost impossible to have this job and a personal life"
bad,Hard place to work. A lot of people come and go. Very hot during the summer months. Poor safety regulations and no room for advancement I maxed out at fabrication lead for 12.35/ hr
bad,"Below average pay, below average training and above average expectations from staff.  Awful shift patterns and awful management, they have little patience for anything that prevents you from taking 200 calls a day"
bad,Take advantage of you on contract and had to work Canada Day.  Off 1 week w/o pay plant shutdown.  No notifications to advise or communication.  Poor management.
bad,This place was very stressful.  Management looks down their nose at employees.  It is their way or the highway no compromise.  Never make a mistake.  They want someone who is super human.
bad,was a temp job but  even if you get hired on there the conditions suck and most of the people that work there are  very rude and a bunch of know it alls.  management is worthless.  half the time they send home people early  and the pay sucks.  dont waste your time trying to apply  but if you do  they will basically hire anyone.
bad,"the management here is not of any quality, they are only worried about their own personal advancement and do not care about who they use to get there, i would never go back there."
bad,Held back from advancing due to trainees I started with. Racially discriminated and management did nothing about the numerous altercations that continued on for months.
bad,Learned a lot but was glad to leave. Not even sure if stamford office is still operating. Everything was moved to headquarters out of state. Crazy work hours.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"I have been very disappointed at the lack of leadership within the various managers I have worked with at the local / regional level.  There is no leadership actually.  There is no communication, and the constant canceling of conference calls and meetings based on our direct manager never being in the office knowing what is going on within our team has been a challenge to trust the environment we are given to work in."
bad,"In my career I have NEVER found a more disgusting place to work."
bad,"JCI is a corp. umbrella.  Enough said! The company does not help when there are clerical issues.  I have worked here 6 months, and my insurance is still not correct, what does that say about the company?"
bad,very poorly managed and not a lot of opportunity to advance. look else where if you want a career . No one seems to know what going on and what the mission is except to bill customer as much as possible
bad,Human resource manager puts her friends in management positions  and not the most qualified.Not very safe place to work they have had numerous accidents and heart attacks due to high heat and little ventilation
bad,I’ve been working with this company under four months and have experienced discrimination and retaliation. I have complained to HR and there integrity hotline and nothing has been done. So I reported the issue to EEOC in hopes they file a lawsuit and I can leave without having to be fired which they are trying to do anyways. It’s very stressful to work here in Roswell ga.
bad,". If you get a job offer here, stay far away. There are plenty of other companies that can stay competitive and keep up in the industry. This company however, will hire anyone with a heartbeat and no knowledge of the industry. Everyone has different schedule they leaders coming late because they can fix the time Friday they goin out to do personal stuff no tools to work radio (walkie talkies) without bottom you need to get a pen and try to answer in less words is like for imigrant place they don't respect. Other with high position without knowledge breaking OSHA law a lot all closed without ventilation getting cancer sniffing the copper odor. team leader manipulate the supervisor Union Stewart smoking outside the building enset to be working, president of the Union walking around looking for some bictim to blame they don't help you at you own they smart ideas they created they own  Human resorce anti ethics losing customer shipping stuff late you everybody knows you Id and pass they don't show you  to use the system . System is bad internet is like when the internet started super low old computer to work but new computer and laptops for the offices. Jci plant of largo Florida while i was written this down noticed on different review is the same each plant"
bad,"This has been the worst job I have ever had in my life. You get zero training, management is never there to help, there is no HR in the building and people talk to each other awful and there is a lot of office kayos."
bad,"No matter how much qualified I was, I believe they only hired union recommended  people. They kept on sending this stupid rejection letter praising your skills but not even an interview."
bad,Chase your tail all day long. Place is a revolving door. As they hire people the same amount quit. The right hand doesnt know what the left hand is doing here.
bad,Johnson’s control does not care about their employees or their well-being! The leads are very competitive . They expect you to do so much with little pay .
bad,"The JCI management culture is very top down. They don't value or respect their employees or contractors. The give them impossible deadlines that set them up for failure. For example, a project team will analyze and plan out a project. They will present the scope, budget and timeline to leadership who will demand they add scope and cut the budget and timeline in half or more. The project team accepts the terms knowing very well that it will be the quality of the project that suffers. Then people kill themselves to try to make the timeline but in the end it usually takes longer and costs more money than originally planned. There are a lot of power struggles and waste at that company. It's truly who you know not what you know or how capable you are."
bad,"Environment and culture is oppressive! Facility outdated and substandard, They are not concerned about the employees at all, double standard. Upper management is a joke. Extremely low morale, and micro management at best! Would not recommend to anyone!"
bad,"Due to change of management consistently it became very stressful."
bad,"I can never recommend JCI to anyone who is different. I was told people were complaining about how I walk, leadership has no experience and intention to know what their employees do and that's why they have unrealistic expectations."
bad,"I worked as a temp, everyone there treats you differently because of that. Hours were ok other than I worked 12 hour shifts Saturday and Sunday so no real social life. Pay was pretty good for a temp job. Not much more can be said."
bad,"illiterate management.  clique environment. no new ideas unless it's a management idea. no advancements.  hostile work environment."
bad,"This company does not value the employees on so many levels. You are watched constant, Wrongfully judged. The unit managers and directors are uncaring and only think about saving a dollar. The entire call center is unethical."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,Good people but didn't like some people and didn't like the stress the company put on me the higher ups did not like answering question or fixing any that was wrong
bad,Johnson Control/ Yanfeng is going through a huge lay off period which happened 6-7 yrs ago as well. If they were securing more business it would be an awesome place to work but the lack of new business makes it an unstable work place. One day you can come in to work and at the end of your shift you could be laid off you just never know.
bad,Cell Phones on Monitoring Center Floor Violating Corporate Policies & Compromising National Accounts Security. Poor Management. Racial & Age Discrimination. Harrassment. Bomb Threats. Out-sourcing most departments to Phillipines  is now on-going. They are NOT the ideal employer in Kansas City.
bad,"this is the worse place to work, everyone hates it here, management treat employees like garbage. they dont care abt work life balance and the schedules they give you will make u wanna quit. its all about seniority here, people who have been here for 10+ yrs dnt leave cause they can get whatever they want but if u are new u will get the worse shifts the worst hours no way of taking days off u dnt get anything"
bad,Their ad displays two pay type regular and incentive pay. when I asked to be non incentive they told me I have no choice. When I started working there I see why the pay you on incentive. it’s because their machines are always breaking down or pumping out bad out of spec products. If the machine is running good you’ll make money. If the forklift guy brings your supplies late or you have problems with your lead plates “there goes your incentive pay”. I was also told that my pay would be based on my performance only to realize that it was also based on my loaders performance along with everyone in my department.
bad,"Simplex was purchased by Johnson Controls, and made to decision to relocate all jobs to Mexico. So no need to apply now, It was so much better when it was Simplex Grinnell"
bad,"Poor management and once program is launched you will be laid off. No a good place to work long term, too political and no genuine concern for its employees. All show and no real substance"
bad,Was forced to do 2 jobs on the 3rd row line as it was always understaffed. Ended up getting my finger trapped in a gap in one of the machines. Left me disabled for life. Then Johnson’s try to say I done it on purpose Haha Dont Work for these people you are just a number. Might aswell be a robot.
bad,Johnson controls which is now ADIENT is not a company i would recommend anyone to work at unless they change the Hr personnels. Its a buddy system they don't care if they not doing their job and this is the reason why their names keep changing.
bad,Managers don’t know how to work with a team. Micro manage everything even washroom break. Do not have proper culture or management. Just work and get your paycheqye no good relation between colleagues!
bad,"Please note I am only a contractor at this company and this is my take of my experience there. Also, my view could be tainted by the specific managers that I work with in my department...... Very, very corporate, almost not even human. To make it here, you have to kiss corporate butt. This is why corporate America gets its bad rap....its cold, greedy, and all about the bottom dollar. This corporation does not care about people. They don't matter. They just cost too much. They will find every possible corner to cut to save a penny. This sounds very negative, but I want to give a brutally honest review without sugar-coating. Starting to realize corporate America is not for me..."
bad,"I’ve learned a lot of new skill thanks to Johnson Controls, I’ve developed a better way to work with others and Also developed a scene of quality and putting quality number 1 in the job that I do."
bad,Working at Johnson Controls as a female is very difficult if you’re not in a office setting. I was sexually harassed every other day  complained to supervisor and HR and nothing was every done. safely isn’t there number one goal night shift have it easy because no one is there to oversee employees doing their job.
bad,"Horribly management resulting in unnecessary job lost. Having a family to support, th3us is bad option for employment. They handle you like you are nothing but an object, and play with your life and money for their own satisfaction."
bad,"They expect to give their customers quality security service. But they do not hire and train quality employee's! They treat their employee as cattle. They just want a warm body in the chair. They have new hires classes ever 2 months. 4 weeks training class. Within a month of being on the floor after training. 90% of that class has quit!. You get on the flood with  less then 50% knowledge to do the job, and the other 50% you learn as you go the hard way! "
bad,"This is a company that would rather allow employees to quit rather than put them in their perspective rolls based on their stats and contributions to the company. Those that are doing the "" bare minimum"" are allowed to be promoted strictly on the fact that that are passing. It's in the contract! This is a company that does not care about it's employees. The attitude is unchanging and it's sickening. The list could go on. This company is the preparation to get you on to something better!"
bad,"Worked there for almost a year training and management was terrible. No incentive to work there, was harassed and talked to like a dog. Work load was super slow."
bad,"While employed at tyco they had issues with bed bugs and roaches that management was well aware of but refused to ever address. One positive thing about the job was everything they taught in training about the security business. Coworkers are nice for the most part, of course there is typical call center drama. Main issues was the pest problem"
bad,To many bad  things to list long hours no respect from shift  management  to office management  day or night employees set you up to fail so they can keep there jobs
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,It's bad workplace to work at the employees with high seniority think they own the place the supervisor needs to take classes on how to treat his employees. the pay is bad the work you do is more than what they pay you.
bad,"The hardest part of the job is to release parts when that get stuck. "
bad,The organization has to be mindful in the manner in which their employees are being treat by management.  The opportunities were slim to none.  Environment  terrible.
bad,"What an opportunity to work with a fortune 500 company, the experience was a great and remarkably fruitful.  I enjoyed my time there and would probably do it again."
bad,Terrible place people dont care make u do everything long hour no advancement no raises dirty factory old machines like really old pervert employees terrible management
bad,Hard work goes punished yet anyone not working like they should gets a promotion. I did learn a great deal on my own with little to none in the training portion. It a fast paced job and you have to pass or fail your own work. Most enjoyable time i had was with the people who had the same work ethic as I.
bad,The managers micromanage the departments and do not know the job responsibilities for the department they manage. They make up rules that have zero reasoning. Each week there is a new change that does not make the employees happy with the environment. Anyone that I talk to is miserable there and wants to get out as soon as possible. They say there is an open door policy but no one feels safe to say anything.
bad,"horrible treatment for employees do not recommend, was always talked to down and was not kind to employees, does not provide AC when we built AC units, not for the employee not even the Union."
bad,"I was with them for just under a year, After I refused to do a part of the job do too my safety they showed me the front door, Not a fan of an employer that will allow something to swing above my head where it will make contact with my head,, I like to keep my brains unscrambled thank you."
bad,"Die Stelle ist nicht zu Empfehlen, stendiger Wechsel in der Firma, negative Stimmung, Mobbing wird vom Teamleiter (H.Thireau) gefördert. Es gibt keine Richtlinien für die Einschulung der neuen Mitarbeiter, sehr unprofessionelle Einschulung, (mir wurden die Einführungskurse gestrichen um Geld zu sparen.) Abgesehen davon erst recht keine Aufstiegsmöglichkeiten in der Firma."
bad,A  Very dangerous place to work. They have the buddy system  in place. they preach Safety but in reality safety takes a back seat  and foolishness takes a front seat.   Don't if it has gotten better now or not. But it was bad while I was there. Now that the HR manager was forced to resigned maybe its better. maybe  not.
bad,"You aren't ""allowed"" to leave at the end of your shift unless you have been ""dismissed"".  "
bad,"No team work no room for advancement for certain groups of people even with a four year college degree. They make sure you don't get anything. For certain groups the pay is different lower even doing the same job, and have more experience. Even talking to HR, management, corporate nothing samething. Huge turn over unorganized I blame management it could be a good place to work if it was fair to all groups of people. If management were trained instead of just giving the jobs the place would be successful."
bad,"not a good company to work for the job sucks and the working culture is terrible."
bad,dirty hot work in a welding shop. there are major harassment problems here. the management doesn't care about the work/life balance. you will be talked at for the smallest problems and be blamed for it.
bad,"All they care about is production numbers. If you get hurt they come up with a reason that it wasn't job related. Drugs run rampant throughout plant, but they are the only way these poor people get through the day. Best thing I ever did was quit after 10 plus years. They are in the business of hurting people."
bad,There was nothing nice about this company. The management is cruel and have no remorse and does not respect people's views. When you oppose the company way of thinking you get fired.
bad,"Terrible onboarding and orientation!  Poor HR, IT and management!  They will expect you to do everything yourself!  Very unsafe!  I worked in one of the labs.  It was very ancient, old test equipment, dinosour techs and engineers.  These are not your high end engineers and/or techs.  They will hire anyone, whether qualified or not!  VERY PC, liberal!  CEO is a crook!  You never know if your job is secure!  They go to other States and countries to hire, as everyone knows how mad they are local in Milwaukee!  They pretend that they care about the local community."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,when i worked at jci it was bad i would run 2 machines at a time loading and unloading parts making peice rate but the attitudes of people and managers and the way stuff happens like the friend ship circles they have going on if your not apart of their friends or you dont mak it good with them you dont get any promotions or stuff like that . when i was working for them i use to come in and work all the over time i could some times i would put like 92 hours in a week and no days of for a month but theyt acted like it didnt matter and that all i was their for was to make them money and thats it they didnt care about us at all they are a bad companey to work for
bad,"The company does very little keeping employees safe. I have lead burns on my arms because the company didn't give any proper PPE to keep my arms from being burnt. The lead dust in the air can be carried home on clothes or what not. They do test for lead levels in blood but the safety team does not help with solutions about high lead levels in blood."
bad,"A typical day at work is being judge by not only my race and being a temporary employee, but having 5 different trainers in one night and having to deal with multi people throwing things at me and calling me names avoid this company at all costs."
bad,"The ""lead IT"" is a lazy person who refuses to train anyone.  They tell you in the interview that it is an IT position, its more like a babysitting position for an application.  The ""lead IT"" person likes to change people's schedule with minimal to no notice, and get upset when you cant.  There is little training to be had.  Always met with ""figure it out on your own""."
bad,"worst job ever, supervisors were terrible, account supervisor worse, beware of lies, get everything in writing because they will change the rules (Global Workplace Solutions)"
bad,Was with this company 11 years they care very little about there employees the bottom line is everything was not always that way use to be a great place to work . A case of a company that had great people that lost site of that and are losing them .
bad,"Working here was hard work and a lot of long hours but good pay! You never stayed on one task, there was always something to do. My co workers were more like family because we were around each other for so many long periods of time, the hardest part of this job was the production work women had to do that seem more suitable for men. The most enjoyable part was learning new things you wouldn't expect to learn in such short periods of time."
bad,"To many hours, instead of fixing the stuff that needs to be fix they just made us work more hours instead of fixing the problems before the product had to be out the door. So much stuff was sent back to us to repair due to them rushing everything at the last minute."
bad,The HR Dep has a  deficiency on planning and development. Controller does not have a good organization skills therefore the accounting department is not profiency.
bad,An environment where closeness and bonding between management and staff in inculcated into the everyday working life.
bad,te of my clerical and office management skill along with warehouse work to be able to go from using the computer to driving a forklift unloading and loading product. being multi tasked and being relied upon work well with others or by my self very little or no supervision required.
bad,No support from local staff or corporate admin.  very long hours including weekends with no break.
bad,"Don't care about people.  They just will ship garbage out the door.  No care for the customer.  Bottom line company only. No incentives, rewards, nothing for the employee.  I strongly urge to stay away."
bad,unhealthy environment . dealing with car batteries and acid gettin on your face and skin . lead fumes was around the workplace. co workers was fun to work with .
bad,Wire the heater as they came down the assembly line. Very fast paste job
bad,"not a great company to work for, favoritism, union does not work with its employees. Was given points for attending school and military. It was a hassle to get my points taken off it seems like they only care about you being there and not furthering your education. Tools where stolen and they don't care when I get reimbursed. most workers push overtime on the lower seniority employees and never want to work."
bad,bad company team was complaining about the jobs no over time and no room for advance and no leader ship skills
bad,"Horrible place to work for, full of middle management's poor decisions that hide what really goes on from corporate, and they DO NOT care about their employees or their families. "
bad,"since working for the company in 2011 I have found management to be disrespectful and manipulative. "
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"They'll fire you no matter what. They don't want to hire in temps. They fired me unfairly, my ride was leaving and I would have been stucka half hour away from home. They yell most of the time and those that were hired in treated temps horribly. But then I heard JC fired everyone. Very dirty and not a great work environment."
bad,Organized out-bound freight and secure appropriate equipment to ship freight into the USA
bad,"Johnson Contols is the most mismanaged company I ever had the displeasure to work for! Beware any job posting stating ""Looking for an overhead and pedestrial door mechanic"" This job is a nightmare! You are forced to work with a drug abuser with a serious attitude problem. He has to be the dumbest person I ever met in my life and his supervisor isn't much better. They welcome workplace harassment and teamwork doesn't exist!"
bad,This company is a joke to work for. They use bill 168 as an excuse to fire people who actually do their jobs. Team leaders back stab you and management has a system in place 90 % temp workers 10 % fulltime . . this should indicate something to future prospects.
bad,This Company does not care one bit about their employees...
bad,"60-70 hour work weeks, no support from management, high turnover of work force."
bad,Johnson Controls is by far the single worst place I ever worked. My Managers have their little pets who were more than welcome to break all the rules and do what ever they felt like even harassing fellow employees.
bad,Johnson Controls at Kodak by far is the worst place in Rochester NY to work. Management is clueless out of control. Employees are encouraged to harass other employess. Human Resources is non existant. The people who do the work and take pride in what they do are treated like garbage while the people who use drugs and cause nothing but trouble are rewarded. I went to Human Resources and Management 22 times to do something about work place harassment by another employee. Johnson Controls refused to do anything about it and in turn I was forced to resign.
bad,"The work and coworkers were good. Management thought it better to grind everyone 10 or 12 hrs. a day, as opposed to forcing the lowest seniority person occasionally as needed. If they make any profit in the Battle Creek plant, it'll be a miracle! Maybe other plants are better, I know for a fact they pay better!"
bad,The supervisors at this company did not deal with the bullies and allowed a hostile work environment. Morale of all employees suffered because of this. You had to walk on eggshells.
bad,"Low morale, big on hiring external and contractors. Not willing to help you succeed, instead they hire from other countries. Very clicky and hars to fit in."
bad,"Management hires you and then find a reason to let you go immediately before you make your 90 day probation. Immediate manager was upset because I called in and decided to let me go after I was on time from the day I started.  He decided to fire me for not reporting an injury directly to him although their policy was to report injuries to a manager.  The injury was reported to his manager, because he was not on the floor.  Unfortunately it was only an issue because he was angry that I called in."
bad,"I worked in all three departments...trained in all areas. Never treated fairly, worse experience! Made good money but never fully accepted for my efforts."
bad,I was there only 3 weeks an they fired me because i could not catch on with the line fast enough they started me in a small area an they bounced me around an expected me to learn everything in 2 days when they new i never worked in a factory before am the leads nor the supervisors will help you or teach you nothing they dont care about there employees at all do not go to Johnson controls its a horrible place to work for
bad,"Some supervisors are not qualified to be supervisors, they are part of the click so they got their position .They  beat you down mentally never any positive reinforcement, It's a joke, I'll be gone as soon as I find another job."
bad,Horrible place run. Management  has no clue they blame employees  and are clueless. They have favorites who do what they want but follow protocol only to people that dont kids their behinds. No HR either goodluck with that no communication at all and ignore requests and safety issues.
bad,"Tuve la peor experiencia en mi vida laboral. Entré  muy entusiasmada pensa do en la estabilidad de la empresa, pero me llevé una sorpresa. Para el área del call center toman gente todo el año, en promedio 10 personas por ingreso y justo antes de finalizar el periodo de prueba te desvinculan, sin causa. Los supervisores no tienen ningún interés en darte un feedback o acompañarte en el proceso. No tiene nada que ver con el desempeño, simplemente te desvinculan. Además el enfoque a la  retención de clientes ya habla de que la empresa presta un servicio deficiente  en todos sus aspectos.  En 10 años de trabajo, la experiencia más  nefasta."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"No collaboration "
bad,"Would not recommend anyone to work for this people,unprofessional with employees,unpredictable schedule.Promote the wrong people.You work hard you are not going nowhere."
bad,"Good pay. Too much overtime but wasn't a problem for me. "
bad,"As long as you will suck mgmt's butt you get somewhere.  Turnover is horrible.  Would not recommend working at JCI unless you want to be unemployed within 3-6 months.  Stay, benefits are the worst.  Family of two out-of-pocket expenses is more than $15,000.00"
bad,"Mandatory overtime for months. Low pay. Management makes you feel like you are in a boot camp. The company makes commercial AC units, but you work in a warehouse without AC, where the temperatures reach 120 degrees in summer time. The turnover rate of employees and management is comparable only with Trump's administration."
bad,"2nd shift lead had no clue about his role or how to train employees. Would throw you under the bus to  save his own skin when ever possible no matter who was at fault. Training is completely absent and management expectations are unrealistic. If you enjoy sitting 8 hrs straight staring at a computer monitor this is your job, it just wasn't for me."
bad,it was a difficult job for me because the person that i was working with was a female and she was dating my supervisor so most of the time they would go out and leave me with most of the work.
bad,"This company has NO support. The company has no direction and is the worst company ever. If you are looking for a great company this is not it . Worst quality of life, worst management, worst HR, and very stressful. The Florence SC site has NO direction they change as they see fit. This location has a big turn around and has had a number of Plant Managers . It is so bad people have started in management and  quit 3 weeks after they were hired."
bad,this is not a place you want to work for for too long. Management at has been a bad to minority and they place balm constantly on them. so many of them get laid off all the time.
bad,Even before I stared I was weary about reporting there for my first day. I got a bad vibe but I ignored it and showed up anyway. Seems that my bad vibe was correct. The training was non existent. I had to learn most things myself. Stumbled through my time there never knowing wht they want but hearing complaints when they did not get what they want. I became discouraged and disgruntled real quick. The atmosphere was very negative and the staff were unhappy. They force everyone to work 48 hours a week so there was a lot of burn out. I guess the way the staff there kept themselves happy was by petty back stabbing and throwing people under the bus. It did not win them any favours but I guess that it kept them amused. Glad to be gone from there. I should have listened to my instinct and not accepted a job there.
bad,"Standard call center work. Opportunities for advancement are there if you are a young person, not so much if you are older. If you are intelligent, dumb it down or you won't be promoted. Ethical issues abound."
bad,"Call Center both in and outbound work.  Non-Stop work.  Management isn't very good, not that the managers don't try just they are not given the resources or the time to work with their teams.  New Hires into any position are paid more than tenured employee's.  Stable Employment if you can follow the attendance policy."
bad,"Benefits continue to be cut, management out of touch, company focused on the wrong things, projects are copy/paste of other companies, the only benefit is that the people that you directly work with are decent."
bad,"Great place to work if the management likes you if they don’t they will find a way to get rid of you. Ever since they bought Tyco it has gone down hill in benifets, and has gotten more cutthroat"
bad,This company does not care about its employees in any way! The managers only care about their bonuses and force an unbearable amount of pressure on the lower folks as they are only trying to stuff their pockets more and more while keeping you in the dark so you never know if what you are doing is helping or not.
bad,Nonrealistic expectations of what the job should entail. Little to no spare parts. Everything reactive instead of being proactive. Fast paced and unrealistic personnel for the job duties.
bad,The place was never vinted correctly from the weld smoke so it was always foggy inside the building the equipment was always breaking down and always rigged together never truly fixed and overtime is mandatory so you had no choice in the matter but work and you always worked overtime so 6 days a week non-stop most of the year 10 hour shifts
bad,"Never enough always threatening you makeing empty promises, always wants more. God forbid you get sick . stay away from here. only get a 10 minute break, and a 20 minute lunch."
bad,Highly hazardous environment to your health. Poor management that creates a serious moral problem with employees.Dirty with lead stored inadequately for years. Safety is second to production.
bad,Hacer tu trabajo de manera eficiente y responsable.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"At the time I was subjected to a very racist environment. At the time that this occurred in my department, had not happened since the 60s. I believe this was a departmental issue. Not a good look for the company."
bad,"The training program was not up to par, they didn't leave you in one place long enough to actually learn anything. they just want some to push buttons"
bad,The management is only a day to day procedure. The management has no answers for you and does not follow their ethnic policy. The rules of working at Johnson Control was not the same for every employee. They do not stick behind their employees especially when it comes to supervisors who are harassing you and/or bullying you.
bad,Great people...bad management!! They could improve their managment team. Understand the employers when there's a lack of work. Provide job security to their employers!
bad,You have no life or rights in this place.  You are not even treated like a human.  Years spent on the job means nothing if they want to move you.  You have NO say in what happens to you in this place.  RUN.  RUN AWAY.
bad,"I really needed a job, so I took it for the 9 day Outage.  We were forewarned that the air inside the plant was not fit to breathe .....so we were working in 100+ degree heat in full face respirators.  Lead contaminated everything....You were required to take three showers per shift......very dangerous.  I the construction, the demolition was a breeze.....Management had a very cavalier attitude when you requested that you lead levels be checked....its a dangerous revolving door at Johnson Controls."
bad,"was hired as contractual by York International then company was bought out by Johnson Controls, my co workers in York were great people, very helpful and approachable."
bad,Its just not a good place to work they treat you like you dont matter you work long hours for little pay the people who worked there were lazy
bad,Dot't try to get job at Mississauga as managers are crazy and nothing seems right way. Because of mismanagement every one need to double work and no coordination between departments.
bad,Bosses yell at employees to get them to make more parts. Cant go to restroom when you want. Cant leave work station unless you get boss to find someone to temporarily replace you.
bad,"Examine the benefits; get feedback from other employees; ask your connections before you committ"
bad,I worked here though manpower and had an awful experience.  HR was terrible as was the manpower company.  This place is a total joke who lies and clearly does not care about their employees.  To them you are just a number. Many inappropriate things go on here that are brushed aside. I wouldn't recommend anyone working at jci or through manpower.
bad,"When you get there they say you will get hired in within 3 to 4 months. This is not the case I've been working there for 9 months and I'm still a temp. Ive never been late or absent I come and do my job everyday and I do it well. The supervisors act like they are on your side but they only care about there problems. This place has taught me that hard work and dedication gets you no where, Its all about seniority. If you are in the union you are untouchable. The co-workers are not that bad, but the majority act like they are skilled tradesmen (When they're not). Also if your a temp then they can make you change shifts like from midnights to days in a 48 hour period. There is nothing difficult about the job expect for the people you have to deal with. I haven't enjoyed any of it."
bad,"Dealed with different vendor and solve the problems in a timely manner."
bad,"It is a job, not the best pay or benefits but its better than unemployed.  Not much room for advancement, and even if the opportunity arrises, its all about whose friends with whom."
bad,The worst plant ever!  Very racist towards blacks! This place will not allow you to move up! They keep you down! They lie about pay! The hr department is a joke! They cant keep any good workers because of not enuff pay!
bad,I  liked working with others on a team and the hardest part of the job was all the demands they made on you and the best part of the job was a team effort.I Learned not to get stressed out over any job.
bad,I loved the job until I was called in for a routine safety meeting and was laid off 2 days before my Birthday and a month before Christmas. If you choose to work here realize that you are just a name and could be fired at ANY moment no matter how well you perform your job.
bad,"A pitiful sham of a HVAC service company. What they have done to my beloved York International is truly saddening. At least 80% of the seasoned and highly qualified technicians left in the first two years of the JCI takeover. To those York technicians that have managed to hang in there, I salute you for having the tenacity of putting up with the New Empire."
bad,"I agree with wholeheartedly with the other reviewers with negative reviews.  Bad management, can't trust the company, very clique-y.  I found the company to be very sexist toward me working as a female engineer.  The salary was so so but I suspect that I was making quite a bit less than my male counterparts.  Very little to no training whatsoever (even though you are expected to work on high voltage machinery).  They are very interested in how things look, now how accurate or well things fall into place.  For instance -x number of female engineers, x number of people certified in x.  Doesn't matter if you are trained properly.  They want you to get as many certifications as you can it doesn't matter whether or not you use them.  You travel all over the US for useless reasons.  The company wastes lots of money on meals and conferences only to pass the costs on to the customers through padded estimates.  Don't bother to go to HR about any issues, they will do whatever they can to NOT resolve it and make it seem like you are imagining things.  In short-one of the WORST companies I have ever worked for.  Plus, you don't get that many paid holidays off (maybe 6 total).  Don't ever work here unless you have no other choice, and if you do start working here, start looking for another job immediately."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,The place was a sweat hole with low pay. people were thrown right in to the work place with little to no training forced into mandatory 12hr shifts 7 days a week. worst company i have ever worked for
bad,"I would not recommend this workplace to anyone. You never know what weekend you will be off. They can tell you that you will be off, then schedule you to work if they want. Unfair management. Don't know if you will have to stay over to work with next shift until almost time to get off."
bad,"Work life and home life are two different things? Well at JCI your work life, to the company, is more important. If you aren't willing to work over time everyday, Saturdays and Sundays every weekend then you aren't considered a team player."
bad,"It was the worst job I ever had. Employee/Management relationship is very bad. Turnover is very high for manufacturing employees as well as for Management. Corporate does not care what happened on the plant as long as it produces. Morale is very low. Look elsewhere to work, will save you a lot of headaches!!!"
bad,They have racial discrimination in that work place. Terrible director who likes to bull doze you so you leave!  I had to file a sick leave due to stress. I left on my own terms as I cannot tolerate dealing with a horrible boss. You will only get promotion if you are a caucasian or non minority. Terrible culture. They work you to the ground. HR is useless! Do not recommend to work in this toxic environment.
bad,The managment is horrible. They do not care about the employees at all. Long hours 12 a day and also weekends. They  put numbers of people. The people who do care about the employees they get rid of.
bad,"Great co-workers. No room for advancement. The atmosphere is terrible. No one is happy and management is discouraging and needs to be changed. Month end is stressful since we need to meet our monthly quotas. The customers are great,"
bad,"The Corporate vision is there however, the execution, direction and  support via regional management centers is missing! This company needs to have a better hands on top/down reset to personally lead progress. There is no-one there at this time to provide that leadership."
bad,My 2yrs there I experienced retaliation and discrimination from my supervisor and also the HR department I'll complain I called the Epic hotline on those people and nothing was done about it I had a investigator put on to investigate the claim that I claim against those and she stated that basically just control can do as they please so I got tired of complaining and complaining so I quit
bad,"The worst working experience ever. Horrible training, lack of leadership, unorganized, hostile environment. Shift leaders use vulgar language towards employees, constantly being degraded and demands are ridiculous due to lack of parts and Equipment constantly breaking."
bad,Management only cares about numbers and expects you to have unnatural powers to get all work loads completely at what the sales rep sold the job at. You will get yelled at daily and threatened that you will lose your job. Expected to replace broken drill bits and own your own tools. You will figure out quickly that basics tools will not get the job done quicker that you will continue to buy buy buy tools to help. Manager will drop in on job site unexpectedly and if you don’t have safety gear on you will get written up and be sent home and will have to take next day off no pay. I can go on and on.
bad,"The job has too much grey area. Rules change so often And there is little to no communication regarding policies and updates. Working here means sitting at a desk for 8 hours. We work month end, long hours the last day of the month, and often days leaving up to the last day as well. We recently found out that the centralized contract team is being sent to Mexico. I feel bad for those folks losing their jobs. I am already looking for one in case my position is eliminated as well."
bad,"The equipment on my line was extremely outdated and took a major toll on your body. Even being in my 20's it was not easy work."
bad,"Management is constantly being fired / resignations  etc.  No stability at the Florence DC plant.  Not enough Quality Engineers to handle the amount of work so expect to work weekends, long days and holidays.  Trying to get improvements in the plant is impossible."
bad,"Do not work there unless you’re willing to be treated like a number instead of an employee "
bad,"Was never told during interview of expectation to provide 24x7 support, and that the data mart being used was running on a desktop pc without job scheduling, revision control, online backup, or a test system."
bad,Upper management struggle to understand and help fix road clocks of the lines. The quality of hourly employees you get as a supervisor makes it hard to hit aop and there is a very high turn over rate.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,Working at JCI was a trial.  The culture was constantly changing.  The mission was unclear.  Team support was inconsistent.  The best part of the job was finding another!
bad,A dirty place to work. Lead dust in the air and on everywhere in the building. Most if not all employees have high levels of lead in there blood and the Company cares more about production.
bad,"Poor management skills in endemic.  Was hired as a professional in my field but was never allowed to manage my programs, projects or teams.  My 3 years working at corporate JCI was the worst working experience of my life.  I have never met more conniving people, seen worst leadership or seen a company that is so crudely pasted together."
bad,The management was in your face to meet production goals since they were just in time.  Upper management was self righteous and arrogant.  Management would often argue with its customers and in the past had caused the company and it's employees to lose contracts and jobs.
bad,"A lot of drama, co workers always fighting and arguing, management is intimidated by employees, not a fair work place, union represents everybody not just union members that pay dues, harassment is very high in this company, and machines are consistently breaking down so you're never promised a full 40hr pay check."
bad,"this is the worse place to work, everyone hates it here, management treat employees like garbage. they don`t care about work life balance and the schedules they give you will make u wanna quit."
bad,"Computers are terrible.  Since Tyco merged with Johnson Controls they are like a fish flopping out of the water.  Instead of trimming management, they are adding more levels.  Way to much power given to their operations department.  This was a bad merger."
bad,They treated us very poorly as we were temporary workers.  Pay was very little and conditions were bad.  Me and my coworker were borth suddenly let go on our contracts with no advance notice.
bad,"Inadequate training for new hires. 13 days on, 1 off mandatory work schedule. Inaccurate/false job descriptions. Hired to operate a hydraulic press then was expected to be a die technician, machine setup technician, operator, and quality inspector on an hourly rate that was barely acceptable for just an operator"
bad,Work in Indianapolis to get easy money! Only if you can handle racist managers! They don't care about you all they care about is numbers! If your not white your not right! You will never advance if your a minority.
bad,"not a good place to work,lead intake is too much.12 hour shifts and no room for advancement for qualified people. its not a recommended place for minorities looking for advancement."
bad,This was hands down the most unorganized job I’ve ever worked at. I didn’t have the tools necessary for me to do my job the first entire month. Then no training was provided. When I reached out to my manager (whom was in a different state) I would get a late reply if I got a reply at all.
bad,"My supervisor quit, was never replaced. The lead was terrible, lazy and discriminatory. Advertised 4 days at 10 hours, remained on ot for half a year."
bad,"I do not recommend Johnson Controls to anyone that is looking for career advancement .It is a good place to gain some experience, and then move on to another company. Several times,I asked to be trained in other areas or departments which they would help you at first. However, I was not able to utilize those skills and I was never given more responsibility even when I expressed my interest to the supervisors. They are more focused on processing their high volume of work rather than the development of their employees. Slowly, I was losing motivation because the work was redundant, and once I realized I wasn't going anywhere in the company. My productivity began to drop. I had made alternative plans to leave the company for something more fulfilling. The people in my department were nice, but the workplace culture was lacking. I didn't get any satisfaction from my job there which is why I ended up quitting. The department in general had a high turnover."
bad,More than qualified for positions I applied for but never even got a call.  Jobs are all open again 3 to 4 months later.  Apparently all the kids they hired did not work out.
bad,Just not a good place to work. The hours are good. But the management lack skills and communication. U will never get promoted unless u are in good with managers.
bad,this company favored people. No room for advancement unless you knew someone. Worked 6 days a week and every week. People always gossip as well. Made jobs harder than what they were
bad,"the worst company i ever worked for in my entire career, there was no work life balance and they didn't respect the employees and management wasn't in touch with people"
bad,Hired under a contract as an internal consultant to assist turn-around efforts in the energy solutions sector. After almost two-years the writing was on the wall. JCI has proven to be a very unfortunate experience for hundreds (more like thousands) of employees and clients. The off-shoring maneuver was no surprise. Hopefully they will be able to recover and re-emerge under better management.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"Worse place I have ever worked!  Zero work/life balance.  Couldn't schedule vacations or get off for a funeral.  Never any positive feedback, only what you do wrong.  And apparently nobody does anything right.  Everyone I spoke to was in fear of losing their job on a daily basis in the departments I had communication with.  No Loyalty.  Set-up to fail from the start."
bad,I would not work for this company again. Overall management very poor and little to no support from outside of contract.
bad,"the people are awful, management is immature, a lot of retaliation for any slight a manager or co worker might feel. their motto is employees should feel safe and valued but that is extremely untrue."
bad,"I have worked for Johnson controls for about 3 years, They have so many crazy management people, who does not even know, how to treat their employee."
bad,Extremely poorly managed.  Site Manager position was a revolving door.  Zero human resources.  Zero investment in training.  I was eliminated to make the budget numbers look better.  What (or who) suffered as a result of my termination?  ... JCI's .customer...that's who.
bad,Very few effective quality checks. Revolving door employment. Work in silos. Little care for what goes out the door in terms of quality products because its all production numbers to meet shipments. Hate going to work each day.
bad,they hire you.You fill out all the paperwork and wait for an orientation date...then they call you and say they didn't forget about you that production was slow and then never hear from them again.....
bad,very hot environment no air condition very little for advancement.
bad,Vicious schedule walking on shells all day. The Company needs to make sure the culture is lived and not talked. Management not professional with a myopic view. Co workers not up to the standard making it difficult to do your job. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co workers. Management worries about spending and not the tools needed for the employees. A lot of finger pointing between department managers. Not a manager in this plant that will admit they are wrong or have done something wrong. To many double standards. Rules and policies only apply to the hourly employees. There is too much politics and not enough leadership in this plant.
bad,Management is all over the place. You don't feel like you accomplished anything at the end of the day.
bad,"I enjoy the work that I do at JCI. I've learned a lot about VLAN's, networks and wireless networks. Management is very poor. The manager I work for has a ""bully"" attitude and is not a people person. He would rather threaten your job on a daily basis than try to work with you to bring the environment to the 21st century. "
bad,"I think Johnson Controls overall is a good organization overall.  Ottawa is a very small part of the company as a whole.  I for one could fix the issues @ the management level, but the company would have to discharge some people."
bad,Spent years and long hours doing control work.  The upper management was horrible and ran people into the ground because the training of other staff was lack luster.
bad,"Typical day starts at 5 PM and goes until 5 AM whether you like it or not. The work is fairly easily and very repetitive, but you stand for the total duration of your shift. Inbetween the stress, and consistent fast-pace of the job, you constantly have your job threatened by line supervisors if you can't meet unrealistic production goals."
bad,"Old school mentality, old operating systems, no training, sink or swim. Men just talked all day or planned their next weight loss adventure or running race. Absolutely pathetic environment, women dressed as if they were going to a bar.  Expanding your job role was frowned upon. Worked every weekend and illnesses and family time was not acceptable."
bad,"After getting a Job offer from Johnson Controls, Tampa FL division with no explanation to be exposed to LEAD. After 5 days they gave a sheet to sign to be aware of the high Risk of LEAD exposure and dangers when this Notice was to be signed before accepting the Job offer and they said they can't tell new hires until they are hired so Johnson Controls Power Solutions find the best way to leave me without work unable to support my family because of they're LACK OF INFORMATION prior to be Hired."
bad,"As of July 20th, 2013, ten managers have resigned from their positions. The worst managed place that I have ever worked."
bad,"They will use you until they don't need you. You will work as a temp for months and then when it is time for you to be hired on as a full time employee, they will let you go. "
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,Management is very poor...No communication skill what so ever..They dont care about the employees health and safety..The company has favoritism and the union only backs you up when they want to or if they like you... Very old fashion company!!! The only thing I enjoy at work were some of the employees.
bad,"I have never worked at a company where there was less accountability and a more lackadaisical attitude in management. Plant 1 on National Turnpike is a quickly sinking ship. It has already been ran into the ground once under a previous name and I expect it to happen again soon as Toyota and Ford contracts are up for review next month. Neither are happy with our performance, justifiably so"
bad,"Great place for catering to you to get you in the door. Then its totally horrible. Management is undescribable, but if I had to I would say.... unorganized; self-fullfilling; no consideration given to salaried or managerial staff (its all about the hourly); productivity is the only focus; abilities and skills are trash canned; may never get to use the skills you were trained for; and forget about family life.... you will be expected to work 12+ hours a day, with some weekends (no exceptions)."
bad,Bad place to work especially if you get injured on there property
bad,Avoid if at all possible. If you have to work there do not stop looking for a job because you do not have one.
bad,Corporate office too involved with day to day branch operations and have a unreastic business plan in todays economy.
bad,"Production quota is required, Integrity and ethics are not of value. ISO is third world."
bad,"I worked at Johnson Controls for over six years and in that time managers and favorites of the managers, no matter how bad they were at their jobs, were treated as being superior to the rank and file. Management  was never held accountable for failure after failure. The company is in full on failure mode and it is due to incompetent management"
bad,"Place is dominated by outsourcing everything to China.  There is no invention or creativity left.  Their idea of research is reverse engineering their competitors products.  It’s wrong, possibly illegal.  If you challenge their culture, you won’t last."
bad,"Extremely poor on boarding process."
bad,"In this company you are hired for an 8-hour shift but in reality it is 12 hours from Monday to Friday and on Saturdays 8 hours, additionally the managers are arrogant and rude to the staff"
bad,"A terrible environment, filled with insecurity and a lack of strategic direction.  People are hanging in for as long as possible before the ship goes down."
bad,I let a company I worked for for 15 years to come to work at Johnson Controls. I was I was how great it was and all the work they had. So not true. No work the guy I worked for was a drunk. Communication was a joke. Somehow they guy gets a DUI and still has a company car however I was laid off because of no work ?? And JCI has adds all over ?
bad,"Fast paced good paying but no home life. Dirty, leaf dust everywhere and you will bring it home to your kids. Management was terrible and had a major lack of communication."
bad,Horrible place to work. Bad management they play favorites. They write you up for petty things . They treat you like you are a child. Not understanding.
bad,"Journey Man is set in his way will not listen to new ideas, more concerned about image and how the job looks then making money and reading specs to your advantage."
bad,Workplace culture had alot to desire. Found out quickly low morale was plant wide. High attrition rate. Management skills were poorly performed due to low production output.
bad,"A lot of the job positions have been sent to Mexico since I was hired on years ago. The jobs are mostly clerical, date entry and assisting the field in booking service contracts and scheduling inspections."
bad,"This company will tell you whatever you want to hear to get you on board but will not honor their commitments. It’s all about a number with safety and quality being the farthest from their priorities. Little to no investment in maintaining processes or equipment, philosophy is get through today and hope tomorrow is better. Very weak leadership with no honor when it comes to how they treat employees."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"I worked as a counter sales associate and honestly liked the job, a lot. Great benefits and work hours and decent pay but without question, the worst manager I have ever worked for in my career. I should say management in general because even the manager's manager wouldn't back you up regardless of whose was at fault."
bad,"Don't work here "
bad,"They expect you to work yourself to the bone. Training is provided but the company is so disorganized overall that it doesn't matter. HORRIBLE health insurance.  (only option is BCBS with a high deductible and everything out of pocket) Low salary and no where near commensurate with their expectations. NO room for advancement in quite a few departments. you can move around but most people are looking to advance, not go in circles."
bad,"I’ve been with this company for almost 2 years. The pay was really low starting but I moved up twice in 6 months so I had a lot of hope"
bad,"This place is filled with unhappy people,lots of grown up people that gossip like they were in high school.Lots of kissing up to mangement required ito keep your job.They give you alot of rules but they don't make people follow them.They hire anybody that walks in because there is such a high turn over."
bad,The job was interesting while yet learning and getting trained how to perform many jobs as they we're assigned. The work conditions was semi hard to adopt to during the work day.
bad,"The benefits are great if you don't ever go to the doctor. They have a high deductible premium. The pay sucks, starting wage is $13/hour and trying to get to top pay is nearly impossible."
bad,Since the merger of Tyco and JCI it is a horrible place to work. The direction changes weekly and they continue to walk good talent out the door. They were once great companies now it not the case.
bad,"Will never work again, one didn't have a life but work and they never told you when overtime was going to happen until the last minute and it was mantory. Work 13 out of 14 days"
bad,When I first got the job it was cool fast paced. Had a issue with 1 person there management backstabs one another the company has a real bad turnover rate due to management and employees. You work long hours but can get out in 8 hours of less if you work hard enough to meet production... not to mention the drug user that has the nerves to tell on people.
bad,"-Typical day at work is getting one task to complete and then being micromanaged until it is complete. "
bad,blood leads poor enviroment bad for health lack of knowledge by mangement for production. people not held accountable for their work efforts.they have alot of good people their but they are managed poorly and they hide alot of safety conditions which may be harmful to employees health.
bad,"Severely overworked, would not hire people when needed, All the best workers - For Some Reason - Were Forced to Leave and The Slackers advanced."
bad,the only thing good there was the money they paid me. was very bad working conditions. poorly lighting and very filthy dirty. and working hours were 12hr days 19 on 2 off.
bad,"There is no place, I have worked in the past 30 years, more dysfunctional  than this.   All the production management Lie to get ahead of each other.  They in fight constantly.   Middle management does not stand a chance of ever being backed up.  Upper management will throw any one under the bus to meet their goals."
bad,"management cant make command decisions because they are scared of being terminated.  crew is lazy, backstabbing and dangerous"
bad,To start with they forgot to tell me when I was hired that productions lines were going to be moved to Mexico. 6 months after I was here the a meeting was heald to let use know we were losing our jobs. Little to no comminacation sense.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"Teamwork is displayed on the surface, but silos and hidden agendas lie underneath.  Communication is poor and ownership of duties is cloudy. Merit is not based off of work performance, skill set, and work ethic, but instead focuses on false relationships and working harder instead of smarter."
bad,One hand doesn’t know what the other hand is doing. The communication and culture is as poor as I’ve ever seen. Management is concerned about the bottom line only. Work life balance is atrocious
bad,"Treated very poorly, management horrendous, everyone is paid differently based on how much they grovel to the manager, extremely unfair, falsely advertised job."
bad,"I worked for the company for almost 3 months, and I could not have coped any longer than that, there is no real management of the teams, one being the team I worked on which was Telesales. There was no support at all, no full training. The only time I had most contact was when I had done wrong which they are excellent at the blame game. I would not recommend my worse enemy to work here."
bad,"Great people, however, poor management and job expectations. High turn over. Extremely stressful. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone that has experience a level of respect and structure."
bad,Beware as company is constantly moving jobs out of the country.  Communication does not exist and benefits are very expensive.  Raises are poor or not given at all.
bad,Typical 40  hour work week. Great job to work minus Management; visit different places throughout the state of MS. Hardest part of the job is to manage time for paperwork. The most enjoyable part of the job is the Teamwork that is displayed among the Field Employees.
bad,Managment and HR in cahoots worst place to work line workers were good but management and team leaders so lazy chathounds garbage just garbage i will never work for this company worst place to work management if they dont like you they dont give u advancement even if u deservie it nothing but complaints about this Company do not apply

bad,"If you just want a job you will never be fired from, work here."
bad,The company has constant turnover in management positions from shop floor supervisors to general managers. The shop floor employees are a good group of workers and want to succeed in building quality products.
bad,"JCI prides itself as being ethical. They encourage you to speak if you  see something unethical and there will not be any retaliation. They lied."
bad,Sometime I have good days and bad days. But I go in an try to do my very best on my job. The management up the is very poor i would not recommend anybody to work there. There is nothing hard about working there. The only time that i love going to work was about six years ago.
bad,"A Companhia em si é de excelente categoria, porém a diretoria nacional deixa a desejar, trazendo desanimo geral aos seus colaboradores"
bad,Work was always stressfull. Management was very poor. The culture was decent. The hardest part of the job was not having enough skilled trades to work on the automated equipment. As the supervisor I was more involved with the computer automated equipment than the trades.
bad,They do not give their employees barely any work so a lot of the time you barely get even close to 30 hours a week. There has been weeks were most of my team was out not working because management didn't supply them work or try to find them any work to do. The management was super unprofessional and treated their employees terribly.
bad,Half way through the project new managment came in and started changing the culture and threw our foreman under the bus even though he was only 2 months on the job. They also didnt have a grasp of what we were actually doing and firing people with the most experience on the site.
bad,"Poor top management.  Upper management lacked values and moral character.  Drove the company into the ground."

bad,"Los procesos son engorrosos, muy burocratica, el 80% del tiempo es hacer tramites administrativos, miles de programas para hacer las cosas y difíciles de entender. Para uno hacer la cotizacion hay como 4 paginas de diferentes repuestos y para pedir autorizacion se demora o hay que hacer muchos procesos. Hay proceso para todo y es difcil que alguien te diga como hacerlo. La mayoria de mis compañeros esta buscando otro trabajo."
bad,"The most unprofessional job I have ever had.  Back in the 90s, I remember how the blue of Johnson Controls was so professional and innovative.  Not anymore."
bad,Management fails to take accountability and hangs people lower on the food chain out to dry
bad,Exposure to lead. Wear PPE and follow all Sops. Maintain a clean work space. Attend monthly safety meetings. Company on site nurse performs blood draws to monitor blood lead.
bad,"Very political climate. Lots of gossip. Watch your back, be a robot, conform. The work is easy but the hours are inconsistent. The pay is low but the benefits are good except for the medical, which is very expensive."
bad,"Managers only care if you can prove you are better than everyone else. No moral support, make a mistake and you will be crucified.  Be prepared to walk on egg shells for your entire tenure. Good pay though. If you can handle the stress"
bad,"I was highly successful with my work, but management refused to acknowledge the true accomplishments. A specific sales rep, that no longer worked there, had created fraudulent contracts and contracts that were completely fabricated to get commission. When I found out the HR representative laid into me. She had to give me the anonymous tip line, but didn't think I would actually utilize it. I did and a long internal investigation was initiated. Since the HR manager was friends with the sales rep she found a way to have me fired for ""productivity."" "
bad,Was a decent place to work.  they did no offer much on job training of their computer system which was required to submit during all sprinkler inspections.
bad,"I would have loved to have a life long career with this company, unfortunately they feel like the management is strong and point fingers at there technicians when repairs aren't being made after the said technicians have constantly email documented issues to management. The company uses the union as a loop hole to get away with issues in regards to pay, benefits, and vacation. Your expected to drop your life to provide assistance to emergency calls over the weekend even when you are not on call. They have lost a lot of there business due to poor management and leadership that is supposed to provide proper service to there customers and can not seem to see any of the problems after there employees communicate issues to them on a day to day basis."
bad,"Where do I begin, the Interview process was simple, but tricked into how far you actually have to travel to certain places, they claim that they will pay for your parking and tolls. You can ask how to set up an app to get refunded but  they do not demonstrate or tell you how, they just tell you to just ""call this guy"" who never picks up. The apps that they use to show you've arrived on site and the locations of the places are usually wrong and give you a completely different address. Also if you do not show you have arrived on site a call from a supervisor was sure to follow immediately with no so much concern about you personally but why haven't you logged in yet. This also cuts away from work time to log in an establish your location, the time you started, and all other things that aren't relevant, then the costumer doesn't understand why us workers aren't testing till 7:30 or later because we have to follow up these apps. Also you can get suspended if you are reported for talking on your phone wile driving, most of the time it was management you were talking to and then forced to to a safety driving seminar.  In 6 months I have put 30,000 miles on my personal car, the management is so uncoordinated, I would leave my house around 5:45 - 6 am to be at a job that starts at 7. I would travel a good portion of the state, to help a lead inspector, only to be told minutes after arriving that I need to go somewhere else, usually a good 30 min+ drive away. Some lead inspectors take advantage of the other inspectors, while one guy may be doing all the work to test all the alarms, while"
bad,"I worked at the Toronto location as a communications coordinator for a year and i hated it. some of the coworkers were nice but there was this supervisor who seemed to be mad at everything. he acts cool but trust me hes terrible when one little thing goes south. there is no room for growth. Someone had to be there for 20 years before they gave him management position. Management only cares about themselves and i think thats why the supervisors act and treat the people under them horribly. Anger management should be part of the whole work culture. The pay is okay. I regret working there. They treat you nicely when you a newbie but as time goes on you will discover things on your own. Its a good place to work if youre the i dont give a hoot  , am there to make my money and thats it type. You cannot work there if youre a softy because you will always cry and stressed . you need to have a tough skin to work with them . Goodluck"
bad,6 days a week. Respirator wear required.  Monthly blood test to see how much you are being poisoned by lead. Mandatory overtime. Can't make incentive pay because machines are 50+ years old and constantly break. Bad union. Pay sounds good until you do the job.
bad,Changes are desperately needed. Morale is HORRIBLE. Care about employees not only on meeting numbers..Folks in office and plant floor are miserable. Something must change
bad,"Johnson controls Port Arthur Texas has large management turnover issues due to heavy workloads and jobs always being threatened by corporate office. When management people leave most of them resigning due to heavy workloads and jobs always being threatened and eventually terminated if you don't leave on their own.The work load when someone leaves just gets passed onto the remaining employees and jobs never filled to the point that people are all overworked and constantly stressed out . The company is run in total disorganization and management is constantly having meeting , but still never gets things right.The original company was bought out over 4 years ago and people still don't know how company benefits work or how to train new employees because nobody knows how to do certain jobs due to massive turnover. The employees have no HR dept. to help set them up to do there so employees are forced to work with no emails, computer access to do you job, so many employees are forced to violate company policies and use former employees log on credentials to try to do the many jobs they are being asked to do. The company is big on the good ole boy system and even if you do a good job they find a way to run you off. They overload you with so much work and you always have 4 different people that aren't even you boss telling you 4 different answers and giving you things to do and pay increases are very rare."
bad,"this company is the worst company to work for and learn from as far as an HVAC (union) perspective goes. If you get a job offer here, stay far away. There are plenty of other companies that can stay competitive and keep up in the industry. This company however, will hire anyone with a heartbeat and no knowledge of the industry. If you are willing to sit around and not learn a thing about the field, this may be the company for you and the management is the worst in the industry, no knowledge of how to manage a team and no respect you are just a number."
bad,We have work for this company under contract basis and our contracts stipulates very clearly that we are not going to be taken on a permanent base so it was don't even have words to describe had I felt about such situation.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"very cut throat, Hostile at best. Constant yelling and belittling. Upper management were never on the same page and at times screaming at each other including getting physical with each other. The pay is very fair but was demanded to work at least 10 hours a day and most weekend without getting paid for anything over 40 hours ( salary)"
bad,Bean counters inhibit you from taking care of your customer.  They are mostly concerned with keeping the job and making the numbers good for upper management.  Consumer sovereignty does not excist.
bad,The hardest part of the job is the people. I think management need to be more leaders than followers. They speak on diversity but don't practice diversity. Johnson Controls is trying to become diverse but to do so I feel they need to start over starting with management. Johnson Controls have a lot of opportunities for advancements.Most of the management need to practice integrity. Without integrity you have nothing. I was so excited to start a Johnson Controls but a lot of prejudice within.
bad,"On commence à 8h00 maxi 8h15. Nous sommes sur un site de production. C'est très dynamique, machines CMS à la pointe."
bad,Hard working place that did over 40 hours every week but paid my bills and more. I learn a lot as an assembler but even more as a brazier has to do with a lot of technique and was quite a challenge I love that a lot soon became the best even the plant manager thank me on how good I was brazing. Management was below satisfactory lazy and to much favoritism and to many people in higher positions punishing the wrong people you can say it was a big family and friend business really but they were fair on the rules time to time. The people that taught me to braze were the best we all work together helping each other out when we can only people I talked to. Mostly the hardest was working seven days a week 4 months straight other then that was really easy besides dealing with bad management. I love brazing so much and with my other coworkers that were braziers they made the day go fast and smooth even when things went wrong all day.
bad,Senior staff is very childish and enjoys having a hostile work environment.  Not trusting and very much a boys club.  Watch your back because you stand alone.  Half of the staff wants to leave and is looking for opportunities else where.
bad,"Çok deği̇şkenli̇k var, yöneti̇mi̇ güven vermi̇yor, organi̇zasyon ve yapi bozukluğu var"
bad,"Vicious schedule walking on shells all day. The Company needs to make sure the culture is lived and not talked. Management not professional with a myopic view. Co workers not up to the standard making it difficult to do your job. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the opportunity to deal with my employees, coach, teach and guide them."
bad,"Just when you think you can get out on a once in a while normal 8 hour shift, you get forced at the last minute or even after clocking out and getting in your car to go home to your family to work 4 more hours. Can't make any plans due to running a 24 hour 7 day operation with a HUGE shortage of Employees, and the fact the so called ""Union"" your in that doesn't help you in any way unless your buddy buddy with the Under- educated President of the local or the other members of the board. This plant is overrun by way too many bosses and not enough actual help to run smoothly and effective. Always trying to fire you or write you up for any small mistake or slip up they can get you on. They discriminate against race and age. And your probably saying oh the person writing this is just mad because of their screw ups, but no I actually left on great terms and I just want to let the people applying to know what actually goes on at JCI in Florence Ky."
bad,"loved my work but poor management of business. I was promoted as a Maintenance supervisor then was laid off, unfair management."
bad,Wasn't to fond of this job. I was pregnant and it wasn't working to well for me
bad,I would not send my enemy to work at this place. The work is ok but the chemicals they use is very harming to the human body. Short breaks are the least of your worries at this place. You build commercial AC units with incorrect metal.
bad,"One of the most unmannaged company i have ever work for specially after the merge with TYCO, where i worked 8 years. the work balance is 60-80hr a week, people quitting like flies. training was cut by more then 85%, in other words it become way too coorporate with too may managers to a point you not sure who to speak to.. recommend look around, there are companies paying more.."
bad,"They have bed bugs that they aren’t treating for correctly. The pay and benefits were great, my manager was amazing but that’s about it. You will have to work holidays and no snow days"
bad,Management changes over almost every year creates a never ending  shift in deliverables. Confusion runs high and you do the best you can to navigate the changes
bad,Do not believe anything the Johnson's control Inc tells you there is no management at times it's like being a preteen in high school the people that are supervisors and managers don't really run the plant it's actually run buy small particular groups I like high School. And especially if you are a minority watch out they will hire you and will work hard to discredit you and get rid of you. It's a horrible place to work it's a joke.
bad,"The pay is so good you dont want to leave but everything else sucks, the people are two faced and act like children, management aren't there to help and guide you instead they watch and help you fail."
bad,"Working account discrepancies is a very challenging, but make the day go by first. for myself, it was a perfect job besides the compensation. I was able to work with customers that could have over a 1,000,000 of recurring revenue with multiple locations, and multiple local offices completing the work."
bad,"Travail a la chaîne rapide,la sécurité des opérateur restent a désirer"

good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"Facility crew members are lazy and simply part changers, any physical work is brought to management through lies and made up stories so it can be sub contracted out.  Crew members have little knowledge of the equipment and rely on backstabbing those who do have some knowledge."
bad,The mangement is done from Wisconsin. It is not very well thought out.
bad,"A poorly managed office where lies, cheating and stealing are the norm.  Completely toxic."
bad,"The only positive is compensation. However, they have no qualms about working you 70 hours a week. Or, weeks in a row without a day off. Trying to balance home life and work is impossible. You will not have a life outside of work. Management does not care about the associates. Unprofessional environment. You could be in the hospital and they still may point you. This place made me bitter. Glad to be gone."
bad,Lots of overtime in certain areas.  People are sent home a lot as well due to machines being down or out of parts.  Hot environment and departments are unkept and dirty unless you are in one of the new buildings
bad,Constant Corporate change without roadmap to help employees transition creates a culture of fear and chaos. Very conservative company that is starting to lag behind competition while still touting themselves as a market leader. New leadership makes entrance by conducting a RIF. JCI = just change it.
bad,"I am working in Johnson control India since 2006, I loved it it really good company, I loved my job and my job profile as Engineer and become senior Engineer,"
bad,"None"
bad,Pull PM jobs and descriptions off of PC. Set up own work schedule to perform job duties. Worked 2nd shift unsupervised.
bad,"A typical day of work for me was getting there on time, and then labor work. Hard labor work. for me it was load operator. I took sometimes heavy battery books and put them onto the belt for hours at a time before my break. I had a back injury and wrist injury when I left 3 months later."
bad,"This organization has many flaws.  There are many divisions that don't communicate well with each other.  Getting anything done technically is very time consuming and takes a multitude of repetitive applications ,emails etc. It can take weeks to get help if a system does down..very poor support technically at the field level.  Poorly run organization. The HR here is the worst and has no accountability or ethics at all."
bad,"No leader ship ,No good money,How do you say overworked underpaid.If you don’t believe me check it out yourself.I think you need to send somebody in there to check it out without anybody really know what was going on"
bad,Overall the job is good. Really easy to do. You are forced to moved departments even though the schedule may not work for you. Management is not good with communication or understanding. Most of the people that’s been there over 10 years are still underpaid
bad,This is a Union job but the Union is horrible ... You do 90days unprotected. When you hit your 90days they retro your dues and take $150 from your pay
bad,"Every night was a nightmare, between poor job scheduling to lack of materials, machines not operating, etc. Total lack of adequate training for new hires.13 days on, one day off mandatory work schedule for junk pay..."
bad,"If you start out in college this maybe a good place to start... work hour is long, and office environment is poor. The company is in constant change, little continuity."
bad,"Clock in at 3:15 and the it was non stop building industrial size A/C units."
bad,Poorly managed company that has it's cliques. HR messes up payroll many times. Benefits are almost non existent. A company that over safeties themselves.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"Leading global automotive Cockpit manufacturer&no.1 in US,Asia & Europe.5 working days company and my true experience is begin from this company.Starting from maintenance&engineering store until my last position in production.This company mobility working style show how Johnson Controls Global Business Operation system(BOS) can developed human potential.But the hardest part of job in this company is less supporting man power in certain area and it impact production flow when the volume going high.New staff also must be a fast learning.This is the reason why so many new staff quit because continental customer like BMW,Mercedes,Volvo, Volkswagen and Honda monitoring their stuff every day.But working environment become enjoyable when we achieve the customer requirement and a lot of new car model passed the pre-production because the sense is like we involve in making every'BIG CAR'we see on the road.But due to impact from global economic slow down,Johnson Controls Global wanted to involve more in their core business,Civil Project and Smart Building.They already sell Johnson Controls Automotive business and the impact to us they offer VSS to staff stage by stage starting from last year."
bad,Hired with 47 people. In 6 months only two of us left. This is the Grand Rapids plant which is Union and has an obscenely strict attendance policy - I just happen to have obscenely good work ethic.  Takes nearly a year to get full benefits. The most negative horrible place I have ever worked.
bad,"If you are on the HVAC side, I would recommend going with a competitor.  HOWEVER, if you know someone within management, then you should work here.  It will be easier to be moved up and for you to be accepted into JCI's ""culture"""
bad,It’s a great trade to learn of your interested in it it’s also a great experience but the company is slow at times which makes it unlikely you will be off for crazy amounts of time
bad,"Worst job i have ever had,they work you like a dog. its 13 days on and 1 day off. They will treat you like a number. maybe less then that, Never work for this company."
bad,"Back when I worked with them they only ran two shifts. Pay was sucky and co workers on lines you worked on we're all about advancing there own self and lied and back stabbed you to get there. My performance review was outstanding, yet because someone one went to HR and lied on me I ended up getting let go. HR doesn't try and hear  both sides of anything. If you have been there long enough all you have to do apparently is lie on someone to get them let go. This company is very cutthroat and they don't believe in any work life balance at all. Beware if you go to work with them they don't care about you. YOU ARE JUST A NUMBER TO THEM."
bad,"Schlechte Arbeitszeiten, seltsamer Schichtrhythmus."
bad,Terrible place to work-  Micromanagement in the extreme and has become worse since they implemented SalesForce as the CRM- The worst work experience in my professional career
bad,"This place is extremely hot inside with no air movement, no air conditioning, and minimal fans for air circulation. Supervisors are down your throat constantly and rushing you. Not safe work place. People have passed out due to how hot it is."
bad,Johnson control in tarboro nc is nothing but a modern day slave plantation cheap pay and the supervisors and management have no idea how to run a business I see Johnson controls in tarboro nc going out of business in the near future
bad,"This is quite possibly the worst job that I have ever had. Good pay, no life. It is a 7 day a week job. They can't keep supervisors. I had 6 in the 4 years that I worked there. Chemically based plant. You get drafted to work 5 out of 6 days that you work. What that means is you will work over 4 hours or come in 4 hours early to cover manning. All the supervisors that I had were wonderful. You are lucky if you don't have to work 7 days. I am no longer there due to the fact that I can't breath in the building."
bad,"Working for Tyco has been a revelation. I've never before worked for a company whose management saw gender as a social construct. That is to say, if Tyco were a farm and needed something to pull a heavy wagon or a plow, it wouldn't use a mule but a Jersey cow. And why not? A job is a job. An animal is an animal. We're all the same and interchangeable."
bad,"I performed my duties to the best of my ability, while being safe and accurate management was there to assist co-workers were helpful as well as I was for them."
bad,"A typical day at work will be overseeing a small group of employees making sure they work together as a team and getting productive quality parts to the customer. Working as a leader with management to make sure that I am being compliant with all rules, work instruction, safety, O&T, 5s, and etc.. and attending meetings that are set forth. The co-workers are very rewarding to be around and work with on a daily basis. Learning their different personality so that they can do the job to the best of their ability. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the different types of people and making good quality parts in a timely manner and learning the everything I can about being a good leader."
bad,it will wear your hands and arms out and nobody there cares if you get hurt. it's easy to get another temp
bad,"Positioned in work area and met daily quota. I learned the functions and skills of machine operations. Immediate management was unapproachable. My co-workers were somewhat pleasant to be around and team players.  The hardest part of the job was handling unfairness, and lastly the most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid weekly"
bad,"used ancient technology, no employee empowerment, very controlling environment."
bad,The controls group managers in D/FW are only concerned about their own rear ends and the little guys get abused daily. High turnover is an indication of this. Every customer I ever worked with hated JCI and were perpetually dissatisfied. Very few field employees stick around long enough to master the product thereby under performing customers to death. The hardest part of the job is actually getting out of bed to take the abuse. The best part was quitting time Friday afternoon.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,The money and compensation wad good. Was bad. Mishmash sexually harassed women. No job security. There were always rumors that the place would shut down or lose work.
bad,I would'nt recommend anyone to work there management don't have good leadership skills the pay rate is base on incentive with a $9 something base pay something that you can't figure out also anytime management can shut down production and perform a so-call dancing with the stars I call that very poor management leadership that's not the way you run business so I rate johnson controls a zero.
bad,it is ok if you like your workplace full of politics with a union that doesn't fight for you.
bad,"Managers are in control and mostly family based at the top leading positions. Always outside advancement opportunities never an inside advancement.  Unorganized majority of the time, no encouragement, people bring home attitudes to work. HR is more helpful to the company because they're more understanding with the job and what life throws at you."
bad,Over work underpay and just work too much espically nighyshift and only get 30 min lunch breaks and management really sucks and unfair and they do not know how to run a production line
bad,"I have 3 different  interviews , by phone , in person directly with my boss"
bad,"The Aurora/Denver office is completely overrun by nepotism and favoritism across the board. Truly try to avoid these people. If you dont go to church with the right people you will be thrown to the wolves time and time again. Your boss will smile to your face then talk smack about you in front of a Apprentice, or tell which Apprentices are their favorites. The organization of this shop is utter garbage. I love this company and worked for them for a long time just to get screwed. Do all you can to find just about any other sprinkler company around town to work for but these guys. Do yourself a favor. Avoid at all costs. These guys are a sinking ship."
bad,"Will not suggest friends to work here"
bad,The employees are frustrated and are begging for change but in the last 5 years there has been no improvement in management or other wise. The company is to big and they over look their employees and what is going on out in the field
bad,"It is not worth your time"
bad,"There is little room for movement due to the size of the staff.  If you want a temporary job then this would be ok.  If you are looking for a place to stay, keep looking."
bad,The workplace itself wasn't bad. It was being shorthanded all the time and only having one day off. The benefits were good and the time paid-off was good.
bad,Plant was over its production capability. Worked employees 12 hour days constantly. Quality was struggling due to hours worked. Customer complaints were multiplying.
bad,nothing good to say about JCI in Brisbane - JCI in Melbourne however was a great place to work. Management now don't care about the admin staff since the merger
bad,This place will work you to death but i find that fun. no room to grow in the company and lots of favorites played in the management department.Lots of hours 12hours/7days  with not good pay.
bad,"The company is a fast paced production.   It manufactures car seats,  The shipping and receiving duties are all handled in one department.  This company works lots of overtime."
bad,"1)a typical work day was 12 hours long and hot in the summer cold in the winter the day begins with prepareing the machine and setting it up and checking to see what kinda batteries i would be makeing that day also makeing sure i have the right parts and everything is correct at the end of every work day i had to take a shower to wash away harmful and posinis lead oxcide before going home,."
bad,Horrible working environment with terrible management and underpaying as well as refusal to pay out bonuses as clearly stated in company policy. Pay often late or inaccurate and no room for advancement.
bad,Went to union school while I was doing my apprenticeship. Guys in the field were not very helpful and didn't feel like I learned a whole lot. Because of the workers in the field worried about their job security.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"We were merged and it was better when we were Tyco. 401k is a yearly match and only if you work the full year. Raises have been minimal 1% despite increases each year in revenue and less spending. Senior Management is so out of touch and the corporate culture is terrible. Work life balance is alright, but could be better."
bad,"Spineless management, and HR will spin anything to save thier dairyaire. Never have I seen such absolutely lazy and incapable management, and especially HR, in my entire life! They provoke and promote distain and dislike daily. A plant manager that is clueless, cannot find her way out of her office, much less run a plant. And when she attempts to manage, she is belittling to inferior managers and absolutely looks down at employees like they are not worthy of even wiping her feet clean! If you like walking on eggshells, being belittled by inferior intellects in management, and pretty much hating yourself, then this job is for you, and you are a sick individual. Pay is a bit below average, and even if it paid more, absolutely NOT worth it!! The Health  benefits are an absolute joke, not affordable, huge deductible, large co-pays and that is with the best PPO plan they have. And if you don't speak 30 languages, good luck, bc seems almost no one speaks English, and if they do, it sounds like gibberish gobbldigook. Diversity is great, but at the expense of proper communication in a place it is very easy to get hurt, that is not a win for me!  Hence, why I am on the information highway to freedom! Deuces !!"
bad,"The promotions are made if you belong to some group of power."
bad,A typical day at Johnson Controls can be a head ace. I've learned alot from working with great people. It would be a great place to work if we had better management.
bad,"Due to many years of acquiring companies and a buyout by Tyco, Johnson Controls continues to struggle with management of its business and IT.  The culture of JCI therefore has suffered and employee satisfaction is very low."
bad,I have no comment. You will have to experience the work environment and culture for yourself to decide. You can make it whatever you want it to be despite it all.
bad,This place is not a good place to work. The management here is not well organized. The work that you perform at the risk of working with lead is not worth the risk. They need to hire more people and stop working people so hard. The benefits are not worth a lick. You will never meet your deductible. They are always producing bad salt. Makes you wonder if this place is going down.
bad,Management is absentee and expresses very little interest in employee advancement.  I would recommend looking elsewhere if you have any ambition.  Interim CEO is very shortsighted and has crushed the innovation culture.
bad,"Union (I wouldn’t trust the union to mow my lawn)  factory is leaded. "
bad,"unable to advance, grossly underpaid compared to other competitors in the same industry. "
bad,Highly stressful work environment. Some supervisors micromanage to the point of ridiculousness. Many people have left because of the stress without having another job to go to
bad,"They like to dangle money in front of you to get you in there, once your in they forget everything then blame HR."
bad,Poor management all they want is getting the work done don't care about if you are sick or anything just be at work and do your job and if another employee is out that day you may have to do they assignment also
bad,"Po 3 letém působení ve firmě Amazon mohu po srovnání, ať už platu , tak pracovních podmínek a chování nadřízených zaměstnanců vůči podřízeným a hlavně způsob výběru vedoucích zaměstnaců (kde nezáleží na vzdělání ,praxe , ale systém kdy nejvíce neschopný pracovník je nedříve přeřazen na pozici zásobovače a posléze povýšen do pozice vedoucího pracovníka i třeba se základním vzděláním a  někdy i do pozice vyššího menežmentu) odměny zde jsou rozdělovány (pohyblivá položka platu 30%) na základě oblíbenosti nadřízeného , nikoli výsledku práce."
bad,Typical day was spent either assembling or tearing down default parts. We continually worked 12 hour days 7 days a week allowing no home life. The employees were nice and easy to get along with.
bad,"Orlando branch probably is the worst place ever, job really slow, poor management. Stressful work environment, they hire "" tradesman"" to do the ground job that way they can pay you less money"
bad,"Company hired me at a low salary promising a great work environment and good raises. 2 months in the raises were pushed back for another six months with no real explanation. After waiting for one and a half years, my raise even though I hit all my targets did not cover cost of living. As a great work environment, apart from the people who were there for 6+ years and got away with doing much of nothing, the rest of us were pushed to keep up with the backlog. As I said this is the worst company I ever had to work for. I am now gone and in a much happier place that actually cares about its employees and delivers what they promise."
bad,"Very poor place to work not very good pay, team leaders are very poor and dont know there jobs properly. Make to feel like a nobody and not valued."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,Service Manager was more concerned with is numbers then employees. If you weren't his favorite would make your life heckl. Would bother you when you were off even on vacation.
bad,"Our group was outsourced and the transition was painful. The JCI folks were more hostile toward the Lilly employees."
bad,The management team at the olive branch facility is very disfunctional. The production team runs out of materials needed to meet goals daily. The machines have a lot of downtime due to the lack of mechanics. The maintenance department is very unorganized which causes the production machines to be down. The people do not meet their production goals because of this. The new production manager is not friendly and doesn't listen to the people on the floor. The production people get frustrated because the management team cannot support them with the tools they need to be successful. The days are full of chaos and confusion.
bad,"In the past JCI was a great company to work for but over the years there has been considerable restructuring and many people, even with long years of service have been let go.   They seem to restructure every year, which provides no real job security.  They have also adopted a policy if you are injured on the job they terminate you.  Even though it is illegal to do so, they justify it by stating that you ""didn't work safely"".  I've seen them do that to many people, so we now hide our injuries.   They stress safety and how great their performance is to get contracts, but that's a lie, generally they push to get the job done regardless of the fact they have fired half their workforce.     People are good, but work environment very poor, you just don't have job security.   They have sold off many divisions, and seem to partner with other companies.   So no real room for advancement as the have to accomadate the partners.  I have a backup plan for when it's my turn to be let go."
bad,"I did learn a lot working for Jci. Co-works where great and fun to work with, however management was not that great there, there where a few great managers however they where few and far between."
bad,há uma loga distancia entre o combinado e oque é efetivamente oferecido.
bad,When I was working at Johnson Controls the bosses try to push you to work as fast as you can. They would get upset when they couldn't get you to work harder. When you was already working at your fastest pace.
bad,The Florence location has talented people working there but management will not allow them to take chances and improve things. To worried about career advancement and not the plant or people.
bad,This was not a great job to have and i would not recommend it to anyone.
bad,"None Professional Enviroment, typical day at work: hot caotic,"
bad,Working for this company's Facilities Management team was a nightmare! They could not keep
bad,"My shift was the ""5-day shift rotation pattern"", which is the (mostly) daytime only shift pattern, which I believe is roughly defined as being any given 9 hour period somewhere between 7 AM and 7 PM. On this shift pattern, it is a 40 hour week which includes working 5 days a week total (sometimes including weekends). A typical day entails answering roughly 200 phone calls, give-or-take and dependent on your confidence, skill, and other sundry factors. This includes two 10 minute breaks and a 1-hour lunch break that can be no more than 4 hours apart, so this essentially means you're working day is 7 hours 40 minutes long in total. "
bad,"Working at the marinette warehouse is terrible managers have no idea what tjey are doing and the interviewer lies a bit the hours are not a standard 8 you work 10 hours and usually saturdat every week. Work culture is about drama and blame, and people have been called a laughing stock and disapointment. If you like having a personal life and soul i wouldnt work here."
bad,Poor leadership at the highest levels of the company are leading to mass exodus. The culture of caring is all but gone with new executive management. They are more interested in making their bonus and leaving then sustaining a once great company.
bad,"I worked as a fire alarm and suppression inspector. I was a remote inspector who responded to the Fargo office. The Fargo office is a mess. It is mismanaged, disorganized and incompetent. You never get the parts or reports that you need in an appropriate amount of time or at all. The scheduling is awful. I was let go for a ""life safety issue"" because I did the job faster than the other guys. "
bad,The management system at JCI is what you would expect working for a fortune 100 company.  The values are placed on those who have a college degree and not the experience needed to do their job properly.  If you make a single mistake it is held over your head for years and is almost impossible to recover your career afterwards.
bad,"If you hate your body and want to destroy it, this is the job for you!  Beyond fast-paced work environment, rate/hour was absurd. "
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"Not handicap friendly, couldn't even able get into the Greensboro , NC office and manager was upset that I didn't come to that office and worked out of the Raleigh,NC that was handicap friendly. Manager also did not understand the affects of MS or tried to find out what happens when an employee has it. The MS affects my legs and my ability to walk and had to use a walker and it also cause cognitive issue that can be controlled by Ritlin and the amount of the dosage. He just ignored it!! Terrible person!!!"
bad,"Are you looking for an exciting career where you earn good pay, good hours, the union actually pulls its weight, and management is not completely incompetent? "
bad,Als Deutscher einfach nur Mies. Man wird förmlich rausgeekelt wenn man kein Türkisch oder Polnisch spricht.
bad,Very fast paced environment. Opportunity to work as much as you want. Have a very old school way of running the business with no progressive ideas. Constantly on call even when scheduled off.
bad,Boss did not define job the position and did not provide training. There was no sense of team. Regional supervisor ran things remotely without knowing what was going on locally.
bad,"Management team controls teams through fear rather than respect.  Head of organization has no education higher than HS.  No communication about company changes or needs.  "
bad,It may just be the position I held but I was often bored with not enough work to keep me busy. This left others feeling animosity towards me which caused a stressful environment. May be ok in another position. I know the installers/contractors are unionized and seemed happy.
bad,I wasn't there long enough to get the feel of the job. I worked in the accounts payable department for a short period of time. The job was only for a couple of weeks.
bad,"If you want to sell your soul to a company that will swallow you up to right ahead. The management is unprofessional and biased and would happily sit in air condition while you overwork; can get hot alot; no room for suggestions; there is little to no logic put into the practices of the company; the pay isnt worth all that is put on you from day 1; little to no formal training program; you'll be dead and they will just replace you. If you've had better or can avoid it, do so. This is slavery, run by good ole boys."
bad,"I would rather not specify my reasons, Suffice to say I found all co-workers and managers to honest hard working people."
bad,Simplex Grinnell was purchased by Johnson Controls who is outsourcing everyones jobs to Mexico.  So many people are losing their jobs due to this.  No allegence to America.
bad,i had a very hard time with this job. i a very small guy. i have tiny hands and i can barely lift 50lbs. plus i worked every day for at least 10 - 12 hours and almost no sleep. all i did was work there and sleep at home and nothing else. i couldnt do it. but more power to people who can.
bad,I was hired to be a service technician and was coerced to do much more with no further compensation and after I relocated at my expense they cut back on travel compensation
bad,"As great as the benefits and pay we’re, It was clearly to try and make up for the fact that you had no life and very little advancement opportunities."
bad,"JC pays on the low end for financial professionals.  In addition to that, tenure is difficult to obtain due to the significant amount of layoffs that they have"
bad,"There were lots of plans and talk of change but no action.  Managers said one thing and did another."
bad,|Everybody in that company lies to better themselves and has no regards for anybody else in that company i will never work there again. I do wish the best of luck to anybody who would like to work there and i hope you succeed.
bad,Management makes a very antagonistic working relationship between salaried and hourly employees. The work is nice but not the culture. Hourly employees will be written up in no time for something that salaried employees are allowed with no consequences.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"Las Gerencias basan las promociones y trato en base a compadrazgos. La evaluación del desempeño es muy pobre, ya que las diferentes áreas viven en lanlucha constante de hacer lo menos posible y tranferirle su responsabilidad a otro departamento. Las Gerencia General y de Operaciones necesitan constantemente de babysitters para que logren terninar una asignacion corporativa. Tienen una rotación tremenda en mandos medios, que hartos por la mediocridad de la planta, su gente y de la ciudad renuncian."
bad,"Johnson Controls is a place where you get ahead only by who you know, not what you know. Over the 12+ years I worked for this company there was an underlying theme of CYA. They promoted a hostile work place and would hire inept managers because they were friends."
bad,"Throwing employees under the bus is routine. Management preaches team mentality, and consumption of the corporate Kool-Aid, then quickly backs away, pointing fingers when the regional management starts asking questions."
bad,"Replacement on saturdays"
bad,"The Louisville, Kentucky plant has been the worse job I have ever had. The location is 4111 Trade Port Drive Louisville, Kentucky. They work you every weekend, management upper, corporate it doesn't matter they all suck. And God forbid you have payroll concerns because their payroll is in Mexico and they are a bunch of incompetent workers as well. Nothing positive to say about the place. If you are desperate for a job then take it but if not move on to the next job."
bad,"The company isn't bad , 6 days a week sometimes 7 a lot of overtime . wish they would give more time off within first year of hire so that you could have more time with family"
bad,"Work rotating shifts, 365 24/7"
bad,This branch lacked good management and had many infractions for HR to keep busy.  Advancement of field personnel to Account Exec positions created a lot of problems with inappropriate behavior.
bad,"Worked there 5 weeks never got paid, never received an insurance card never had a desk to work from. I was in charge of 7 people of which 2 quit within the second week after I started. After 5 weeks there was no action by management to replace these people. Access to the data to do the job was not provided in full after 5 weeks."
bad,"The job left you filthy, dont wear any clothes there that you like. Your clothes will not return the same way. The management is terrible. It seems as if no one knows whats going on, but expects everything to be done on time. Your target rate of part per hour was set lower then what was needed to fill an order. The people there are really cool though, you'll be entertained if everyone is in a good mood."
bad,"A great company but very unorganized. No room for advancement. One position and and that's it. No incentives or bonuses. No raise. A lot of work but not enough pay. The management team does not interact with the employees at all. High turn over rate. Favoritism is definitely one of the causes. Not worth applying your time at all. You will definitely be disappointing. It is not AT&T, it is Johnson Controls. A contracting company for AT&T and they will make sure to remind you DAILY that you are not an EMPLOYEE, you are a CONTRACTOR and you can be replaced!"
bad,"Management let me down, they let co-workers bully and harass people and did not do anything about it. They have a real high turn-over."
bad,"el ambiente laboral inmediato agradable, pero la empresa estaba bastante inestable, por lo que en el periodo que estuve hubo muchos despidos debido a reestructuraciones corporativas"
bad,"Building Efficiency weak on Operations side causing lots of issues from quality to cost. Extremely high voluntary turnover. Accountability is a huge problem in the culture as is visibility to metrics. Over riding high fear of retaliation, and reality perception problems. Communications is distorted, and there are pockets of environments that are hostile. There are pockets of really good, bright, innovative people. However in BE they are targeted and chased out in order to preserve complacency and status quo."
bad,Good for freshers highly working environment stressful job shoes licking is important here. skillset doesn't matter. Good for those people who don't have skill but know how to impress managers.
bad,"JCI is a huge company with lots of opportunity.  It is also an ever changing company and I saw many people and departments change / dissolve during my short tenure.  There is much to learn when working there - a great opportunity, but beware that many do not stay long."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,Training doesn’t exist. Used for profit only. No support from local union . Appears they both have hands in each other’s pocket. No internal customer service at all.
bad,"Can’t trust management . They will tell a lie on employee’s. Coworkers will "
bad,"Wasnt a bad place to work, however when working with younger employees there is a lot of wasted time being unproductive. Leaving newer employees to feel overwhelmed and doing the majority of the work. Then when production numbers are down, blame lands on new employees."
bad,With temp service in building its know that your expendable. They don't care about the workers or their personal lives. They force last minute overtime also.
bad,"Location has been bought out again. Poor management and everything being outsourced or jobs merging, leading to larger workloads with no pay increase. National Accounts organization is a train wreck, all managers and supervisors have left, due to a poor director."
bad,"The people were great to work with and local management was fair. However, the work load was unbearable doing to many things while trying to travel. There was not enough time or emphasis with the customers. "
bad,"to large of a company, poor communication and lack of clear direction/goals"
bad,Company didn’t take of there employees and did everything last min never had anything in order. You would get to work and 3 hours into your shift they would notify you every time we have to work 12 hours
bad,Not allowed to contact Manager after hours due to an emergency. I had death in the family and I was cursed out because I came to the manager's residence.
bad,"This was a good company and job until upper management began micromanaging front line employees and sales employees. Company raised labor rates, and materials so that we were 60% or more higher than the competitors, and we were told we couldn't lower our margins in order to close deals, even with long time customer accounts. Then upper management complained we weren't hitting our numbers, and obviously sale's commissions were less! Good employees have been dropping like flies and joining other companies. The company has become laser focused on showing growth for shareholders and staring at charts full of bad data because their tools don't work, and have been poorly implemented. The CEO is even using the same consulting firm that tanked Enron! Need new upper management that will listen to and retain their talented employees, but in the meantime, run away!"
bad,"Typical day... Service.. Nothing more needs to be said"
bad,"I would not recommend a Welder, or other tradesman for that matter,  to work at JCI in Waynesboro, PA.  Welders are put through far to much hassle for the compensation they receive. The welders here are some of the best in the world, but the pay, retirement and insurance packages leave ALOT to be desired.  They draw alot of folks in from miles away with signing bonuses,  but many leave even before their contracts are up.  I believe the management realizes the value of the Waynesboro team,  but corporate JCI doesn't want to pay for the quality they demand."
bad,High stress trying get production with many obstacles and little understanding from upper management.  I learned how to problem solve on the fly.  Management not always helpful or understanding of the reality of situations.  Work place culture is depressing.  Many employees overworked with no work/life balance.  The hardest part of the job is not have the support of upper management and not having the right equipment or inventory to run production.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck.
bad,Managers go out of their way to ensure employees aren't treated fairly and there is a constant CBA complaint for one hing or another against them with the Union
bad,"If you like working mandatory weekly and weekend overtime, then this is your place! Employee turnover is a revolving door because people can’t deal with the amount of hours and dedication to a job. Example: my wife’s brother passed away due to gun violence and the first thing said when talking about taking bereavement leave is “when do you think you can make up the Overtime?” This is strictly a punch in/punch out job. They are going through a merger so they are still trying to find a direction. So expect procedures to change every few months. They under pay you as well. Moved to higher position in the company and only got a 40 cent increase in pay. Then realized that they were recruiting for my same position for a dollar more than what i was making. A slap in the face to those veteran employees. "
bad,"This is for GRAND RAPIDS ONLY! "
bad,"I joined the team during an upswing in the automotive industry. The job was challenging and somewhat fast paced. I had a few opportunities to travel internationally which was great, but the sacrifices required by the job took their toll. Eventually after dodging a few rounds of layoffs, I decided to leave on my own terms. I miss the people I worked with but not so much the people I worked for."
bad,"Johnson Controls gives their employees the ability to grow your territory. However, they have been cutting back on spending and advancement since I started.  Overall, not a good experience."
bad,Great manager in the Maintenance department. The rest of management struggled with honesty and integrity. The company had a bad habit of seeking outside candidates for positions while housing well trained and qualified employees. They overlooked talent they had in order to keep the position people were in cover. A good company would promote from within.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,The managers are more concerned with running their own fiefdoms rather than creating a unified atmosphere.  Certain departments are held beyond reproach no matter how unprofessional they become while others are held to an impossible standard.
bad,Management will do whatever is necessary to make themselves look good. They have a myopic view of the future and will ultimately lead to failure for their lack of employee care and welfare.
bad,"Good Money, Poor Work life Balance.  Work minimum 12 hrs a day.  While at home I receive non-stop text messages.  Great place if you want to work 50+ a week"
bad,They choose favorites and the manager only cared for bottom line money. Profit is all he cared for. Most of the co workers were idiots and didn't do things legally and by the book.
bad,This is a very politically driven organization.  Financial goals and job preservation are pervasive  compared to focus on mission and employee development.
bad,"The training received from the very first day was very poor. The expectation was to see once do once have the task mastered. "
bad,"Too much work for one person to do.  No balance of work and life.  Phone ringing all days, nights, and weekends.  None stop customer issues.  Customer is horrible, unrealistic expectations, no common sense."
bad,Company is not funding the foundational needs and is overwhelmed with issues due to years of consolidation and spinning off various business.  Company is not productive because they have many different business systems.
bad,"I worked a contract position in the Bothell office for a few months. "
bad,"managers are not very good and corporate is out of state has no idea "
bad,"You have no life for your kids"
bad,"This place was not fun to work at for any reason. Management was not very good and handling employee issues. Certain managers would play favorites to certain employees, and the work environment was not very good at all."
bad,No clear strategic direction. Restructure every time they have to report quarterly earnings. Senior leaders don't trust people they hire and lack integrity. Stock price hasn't moved in a decade because of it.
bad,JCI could be a great place to work if you don't get flushed out in their restructuring program. every 4 years or so about 15% of the global work force loose their job. The share holders seem more important than employees
bad,"It is too much favoritism going on in the highland park plant no one cares and it's not fair for other employees to many people sit and they still get paid others have to work for their money, when employees complain nothing gets done about it that's where very poor management comes in at"
bad,"There used to be a lot of work at Johnson Controls, Pune office. The job was monotonous and there used to be lot of project submitals with close deadlines. I had  stressful time at Johnson Controls"
bad,"The work culture is negative and very stressful. The managers don't respect employees. If you are anything under a lead you are just a number. This is a job for single people,no kids, no life or a home were one parents works. Good luck"
bad,During my time at Johnson Controls I experienced many hurdles directly related to poor management and little room for advancement. Only those who were personal friends with management advanced.
bad,"Perhaps because of the merger, but environment is very stressful and provides a low level of work-life balance. Everyone is very stressed out most of the time as the company tries to work through the merger. Not sure how or who will emerge when it is all done."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,Could never get any consistent direction from leadership team. There was no interest in building the facilities division in the local markets. Strategy was geared toward national and global opportunities.
bad,"Worked for them in shipping for about a year. They have something set up with the union that makes them fire temps after 3 months. Which means they're always training new people. Because it's union, there are a lot of employees only doing the minimum required from them which shifts workload to temps which creates more mistakes which creates more work. No never how long you'll work that day."
bad,"Management was horrible.  Lack of communication, young and inexperienced, no structure, overall unorganized.  "
bad,This is a fortune 100 company that's being ran like a mom and pop's company by older members of Johnson Controls facility..! Major changes need to be made..!
bad,Meetings 80% of the time.The manager I work for is unappreciative for the hard work employees put in. Unfair when doing performance reviews. Family is not that important to him.
bad,good coworkers!! terrible management and HR department!!!. No family time. work 60-70 hours a week. If you get injured they will try to fire you. been on medical leave for a yearend they are still fighting me!!
bad,"Wha not a lot to say. Mangerial roles were that consise. people were not as friendly as they could be. You were always being judged for the wrong things.Things could hve been better!"
bad,Pass on working here if you have an aternate offer. Working eight hours is not an option unless you have seniority or fmla. They constantly hold you over for another four hours without notice and this is mandatory or your fired.
bad,"This a very dysfunctional company. Managers are rude and insensitive. They train employee on diversity and having integrity, but show little in return to their employees."
bad,"Working for this company was one of my worse experience in my working time.  Management was so busy with meeting and phone conferences that they did  not interact with the staff,"
bad,"Complete a holes if your face doesn't fit your out. Snidy management. Looking down on you. Think they can use and abuse and give no explanation to why they sack you. Apart from lies. Do not work for this,rotten company"
bad,"Pay was based on my wage prior to being outsourced to JCI in 2010.  Had only one raise in nearly five years with JCI. Employee questions would go unanswered unless employee pushed for answers and then did not believe managers were being truthful.  Found myself being outsourced again in 2015 to another company.  We were given the VERY strong impression that all current JCI employees would be absorbed into new company.  Did not happen and absolutely did not believe reasons given by JCI management (payback, maybe?).  Did not receive any type of severence package from JCI even though I was told I was a vested employee after joining JCI by way of outsourcing in 2010."
bad,"Old school upper management style that favors intimidation and the aggressive use of verbal abuse to ""motivate"".  This caused a tense work environment most days as multiple mangers/supervisors were getting ""motivation"" from the plant leadership.   Turnover was very high in my experience as I worked for the company for multiple years.  On the positive side, the work conditions were acceptable and the compensation was fair."
bad,"Pro's"
bad,"While on the surface Johnson controls is a good company to work for they take as much as possible and give back as little as they can."
bad,Lots of room for continue ed if you have the ability to put countless hours in at home and off the clock.  Once you start giving a little they want more and the more give the more they will take.
bad,I was part of an offsite branch.  We received NO support from the main office and always felt like no one cared about us. We never received communication about our contracts and would go for months not knowing if they had been renegotiated.
bad,A typical work day is fast-paced. There is a here different experiences everyday. The production team does a great job making production. The management team is young and needs better leadership.
bad,If you enjoy your family DO NOT WORK HERE. If your single good place to work. They make their employees work 10 to 12 hrs a day seven days a week. No exception. If you dont work it your FIRED. Can only use restrooms on breaks every 2 hours or so. If you get caught using restrooms between breaks you will get wrote up. Management DOES NOT care about a employees family or homelife they only care about how many parts they can get out in a days time. Breaks and lunch are a joke. 10 minute breaks and 20 minute lunches. This plant for JCI is the most underpaid plant of any plants they own. The workers are overworked and underpaid. The coworkers are nice but the managment are rude and cause hostile work environments. This company has been known to break up marriages due to the hours and no family life. I would suggest to look else where.
bad,"Personal decisions are based on back log with little regard to growth and employee commitment. "
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,Process driven work environment with very little true care for people in the organization.  Business results expectations are consistently unrealistic leading to very inconsistent performance from company incentive programs.
bad,"Over all it is an ok job, the pay is good, the job it self isn't very hard.  The down side is that the managment is very rude and they don't give you proper training nor proper time to learn a postion"
bad,If you are expecting any training or to learn and grow your trade do not work for Johnson Controls.
bad,Our managers were completely unethical they would ask us what we said in a private online questionaire about the compay. They would find out if we spoke ot HR about private matters and confront us in front of ppl. It was very tacky. This twice
bad,"Hot even had a lady pass out from heat. Management does nothing but lie. Work people extra shifts instead of hiring new people. Management is horrible. Different story for management but hourly is treated like dirt.Do not work here if you have a family. One twenty minute break by the time you walk to break area and wash the dangerous chemicals fro your hands break is half gone. Then get one 30 min lunch. More, more ,more that is all you hear. The older union plants are different story. At least they get paid for the horrible treatment."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of trying to get the proper tools needed to get a job done. Having to deal with 2 different cmms programs to get work completed. Working with a very poor purchasing program with a very limited amount of vendors, making it very time consuming to get parts even for critical issues."
bad,enjoyable part of the job was a challenging environment and good location
bad,"The typical workday included cold calling, proposals, drawings, site visits and customer face to face visits.  Majority of the day was spent on sales activities."
bad,"Don't do it if you are in San Antonio. Terrible Manager. Terrible Senior Leaders. No ethics. No Morals. Sucks the life out of you .Local Management and office don't know what they are doing. People running the office who doesn't have any field experience. Good employees and customers leaving. Low morale, poor ,management"
bad,"Need new management!!!      Don't allow you to be you have the wrong people in the wrong place. I understand earning your place,but when someone can do a better job it's time to make some decisions."
bad,Management is disorganized.  Not a great friendly place to work for.  Automotive can be difficult to work in.  Customers and suppliers are not always friendly.
bad,I feel the company is average. It does have its benifit but I personally feel they do not out weigh the positives. I have been here for over 5 years when it was tyco.
bad,Week management and over worked supervisor who use employees . I wood not recommended this Job until they get new management . The work is easy the hours are cool if when they have parts. But they can’t seem to keep parts so you might get 20 hours a week.
bad,"Project Managing of sub trades to meet commitment dates and budgets. Reports for manpower hours, budgets, rentals, material costs, site meetings, Corp meetings, All of these responsibilities that a Project manager is required to fulfill are rewarding as you are always learning new ways and approaches."
bad,"Bad training, and poor leadership at the ISSM level for the West. More concerned about the bottom line than employees. I had 2 hours of training and was left to my own devices and outdated job aids to learn my job. I had no computer or two months and had to get it running on my own."
bad,"Very high stress. Leadership was spotty at best. Highly political, at all levels."
bad,"If you're single with no family or friends and have nothing to miss while working 50+ hours a week. This is the job for you. If you have a family, friends, any kind of personal life, and realize you work to live not live to work than this is not a place for you."
bad,"Most managers are flexible with working from home if something comes up.  There were a lot of people that I enjoyed working with every day and it was overall a good team atmosphere.  Most people were willing to help out other people when things came up.  "
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,I  was not happy that the company was sold to  China. It was very hot and they had very few fans.  There were too many people that had no English and made it very hard to do my job.
bad,"Very dangerous working conditions, working around molten hot lead all day.  Very hot and stressful conditions.  Have to wear full face respirator and jump suit during the entire shift."
bad,Was doing a job that pays alot more then what I was getting. Got really good at it and wouldnt compensate me for the job I was doing. Workes you like a dog

bad,"Learn to read blueprint on building A/C, work 6 days a week, always learning something new, make sure your area stay clean and safety free, and make sure you look out for the safety of others"
bad,"The management structure creates an environment of its not my job and minimal responsibility and accountability.  Employees and customers are treated poorly with no assistance or guidance from upper management.  Organizational health is poor and actions taken are aimed at punishing those who bring up issues instead of resolving them.  Recent changes in pay structures, 401k match, health benefits, bonus plans and vacations are all detrimental to employees.  Constantly demanding more of field and office personnel with little to no assistance or appreciation.  If you ever wanted to know what it felt like to be meat in a grinder then this is the place for you!  The HVAC side of things seems to be a little better than fire or security but everyone has different rules, processes and guidelines."
bad,Shift was great and hours was ok loved the fact there was no mandatory overtime every week and the hr people was frustrated but just needs to work with them
bad,"Dont apply if you like your weekends. Maintenance on a 12 on 2 off schedule and they try to schedule for your days off unless you argue for it. Cant find employees but yet when they do, they become very picky. Management is very disorganized. Managers have no backbone to stand up for employees. No oppourtunity for advancement unless your a suck up.  "
bad,"My point came from the plant I worked. I have to say there is nothing you can get but the salary. Although it looks pretty high, you gave much more  and lost much more than it. if you don't care your health and family, you can try."
bad,podría mejorar la oportunidad de crecimiento laboral
bad,"Stay away from.  IT, HR, Finance functions have been decimated after large merger with Tyco."
bad,They treat the employee unfairly is like modern day slavery the employees are working in a hot warehouse as thr managers walk around with clipboards all day keeping track of the workers numbers and if they are not walking around looking at the workers numbers they are sitting in their air conditioned office while the workers are in a hot warehouse
bad,"Can't say much, just stayed 6 months."
bad,This branch in Milwaukee needs tremendous help with management.  Multiple times while working there I asked for help being trained and no help was given.
bad,They were a very dirty and nasty place to work. Worked 12 hours a day 7 days a week and yet management could have holidays off but the employees in the office got to have their holidays.
bad,They will under pay you.  Work you at 60-80 hours a week and under pay you.  Short term employees only.  They care more about stock holders than employees.
bad,Management doesn't care about any employees at all. You work all the time year round and there is no career advancement possibilities. Management is so backwards in how they do things it's a clown fest. Terrible place to work.
bad,fast pace work environment union based so if your low on the totem pole you get screwed every chance they get. Managers hate their job which rubs off on others.
bad,"I loved my work and the people I worked with. The job had swings from being crazy busy to somewhat slower paced. I mostly had good managers. Like most large companies today, upper management is clueless and worse, doesn't want a clue. They talk about how they value employees but the actions they take don't match the words they speak. Actions always talk louder than words and when upper management earns year end bonuses of millions of dollars and they tell the employees that they won't be getting their merit increases until July.... well, I guess the action says what they think of the employees."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this company for the fact of shady work ! Now roofs I will recommend does great roofing not so much anything else !!! but learned a little this & a little of that!!
bad,"Same as the rest of the automotive world, never enough.  Worked most Saturday's and Sunday's.  Don't waste your time with this forgotten company.  Culture was terrible."
bad,pay was poor only reason why you would get a good pay check was if you worked a lot of over time which would keep your outside life at a bare minimum of socail time always very hot and not enough ventilation management was poor didnt know how to do anything and would never fix a problem
bad,"Decent place to work till johnson controls took over. then the wheels fell off. plant ended up shutting down and they moved it to mexico. pay was decent learned alot,"
bad,very stressful not much work life balance compensation was below average conditions were not good would not recommend this facility to work at regularly
bad,If you don't physically create a product you don't add any value. That is the culture at JCI.
bad,The position is not longer active. They closed the department. It was ok to work for but long hours alone watching computer monitors got a little boring.
bad,Buen ambiente laboral y con oportunidad de crecimiento profesional y personal.
bad,"The culture is destroyed and it stems from the leadership at the top. Several leaders (top 3) are more concerned with cutting wages, jobs and hiding the real problems; than actually taking care of the people, resolving the internal issues and satisfying our customers. I wouldn't be surprised if JCI closed this particular plant. If you care about your job, want to make a change and impact the business, help the operations teams and succeed; you'll only make it there by being a puppet for the unethical demand of their leadership. Although, other plants don't share the same issues and appear to be better places to work."
bad,Well I gave it that review because it wasnt fair with paying because the job we do is very hard that should be payed more and its a job that doesnt give breaks only 10 min breaks
bad,There is a lot of work to do and you never know what time you will be finished. They could use a better training  program for new employees. Not the worst place to work.
bad,didn't make enough money. mislead about a salary job I didn't get paid enough for the work I did.  had to breathe in poison. worked too many hours and not rewarded.
bad,"What I dislike is the mandatory overtime. We live at work literally. It's seems like someone is always out on vacation or on medical leave. If not that, then we have to cover open positions. We work continuous 12 hour shifts (14 hours for supervisors) meaning 4 days one and 3 days the next with every other weekend off. Pretty much whenever someone goes on vacation that's 7 days straight of work (I'm on my 11th day of working). I really dislike working in lead. We have to wear respirators when on the production floor. Your clothes stay at work. Blood drawn once a month to check lead levels. Very lean company when it comes to spending. Very old fashioned when it comes to process, which most are outdated. The environment is really rough."
bad,"Management has a culture of bullying which hides behinds corporate."
bad,"Although its a job, there was no stability.  The company has changed hands too many times and temps are hired at a lower salary to do the jobs many people held for years.  As a result many people have left to pursue other options."
bad,"Where I worked it was always hot and uncomfortable, there was no real chance of advancement in my position and it was a pretty depressing place to arrive at each day."

good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,Management is rough. The union is pretty okay but if its a temp job through a secondary staffing agency don't expect to get many hours. Have not heard very good things about this place or the people who worked there in my time as a temp.
bad,"Johnson Controls Interiors is now Yanfeng Automotive Interiors."
bad,a typical day is receiving your quota and instructions for the day and then heading to your line or laser for the day and once your quota is met you are done for the day.
bad,JCI is a large company the has it's focus on it's core business. If you are not part of their core business then you get lost in the system
bad,"management is very poor, from engineering labs, production floor, and plant supervision. i would not recommend to anyone that enjoys working hard to begin here. little to no upside and the management does not acknowledge over achieving but will be quick to let you know when you don't quite do enough."
bad,"Typical day's starts with meetings in the morning. Discussion topics include project escalations, budget and portfolio reviews. Based on what level you are at, the frequency to meet your business customers and understanding their pain points becomes primary objective day in and day out. Putting out fires and ensuring the month end closing and financial consolidation systems are fed and reporting is accurate. Meanwhile, I walk one or two of my team members for a coffee break before lunch to check in and see how their day is going. Ask them where I can be of assistance and help remove road blocks."

bad,"Lots of management issues. There where too many bosses and not enough people to do the jobs. The work its self was straining on your hands and upper arms. There was a lot of inappropriate things that happened at that place,"
bad,During a typical day I can be doing anything building infrastructure related because of the small staff.
bad,"Contract company indicated that company would hire direct after 520 hours.  After more than 700 hours of working overtime, showing up and working.  HR never conducted interview."
bad,"This place is a joke. I signed on as a fork truck driver making 15.35 with med benefits and union after 90 days, it was pretty awesome. but working 6 days and off 2 with the possibility of being OVER and IN 4 hours of every shift and breaks are 12, 20 and 12 minutes, you never really have a life. nor can you make plans or appointments unless you take a union point, which you only get 12, so hopefully you can make this job last. not only that the people you work with are not team players, which is important in a high end production line company. HR is a joke. Don't bother getting someone pregnant in the first year, they wont let you file FMLA until your next year.. the dept supervisors don't care for you or what you have to say... i could go on but that pretty much sums up the atmosphere."
bad,long days no rest. a lot of people who don't know their jobs. spent time away from family.
bad,Hard because the supervisor is always on your back. I didn't like this job not one bit.
bad,"I'd hope the company overall is a good company but my branch was down right unethical. However, the corporate standing is they would gather have an OK tech who is a good salemen and I believe in being a talentant and trustworthy tech and sales will follow. Build automation however is a real cool field"
bad,poor attitued people . was nice to drive hilo over theer but othere then that really is not a good place if you are a temp.

bad,"good employees, You work a lot. You never know when you are off. Senior management needs some overall. You can make a lot of money, but downfall is you have no personal or family life. You live there"
bad,If you like long hours with low pay go for it and if you like working around people that ask others about you go for it and if you machine need a replacement or fix guess what you still get blame so with that being said welcome to clanton Al Johnson controls
bad,"Stupid trainer and no support once on the floor. Very political. Don’t care about employees or customers, customers hate them. Avoid them like plague."
bad,"day starts a 8 and goes through 5. Always something to do in Service. You have a set role and do not deviate from it. Years ago you learned different job functions, no more."
bad,"Management doesn't have a clue, they cant keep materials needed and done order more until they are out , and then expect you to work all weekend while they are at home. If your a slacker this is the place for you. there is little supervision and little record of work completed and management doesn't even understand any of the operations .lead people are numerous but are mostly useless"
bad,"Was employed in Tyco fire as sales, Salary is on time, but work environment is very uncomfortable. Nobody bothers if you work overtime without overtime pay / or work on saturdays also. Getting orders is extremely difficult."
bad,"It really depends where you work at JCI.  The corporate environment is challenging but exciting.  Lot's of smart people and interesting place to be, but they do regularly cut people so you need to stay on your toes and it can be very political.  It's more about who you know then what you know unless you are a PhD in mechanical engineering, then you might be okay if you can add value."
bad,Love the place and the job is cake. But the supervisor and grade 13 on D shift are worse then any other job I’ve had. 2nd shift can’t keep a supervisor to save their life. All the 8 hour shifts are having to work 13 days on with every other Sunday off. They don’t care about their employees. Especially night shift.
bad,No fue lo que esperaba.  Un decepcion.
bad,"Coworkers were great, but expectations for both management and sales people were not commensurate with available resources.  Managers were spread too thin and salespeople were insufficiently supported."
bad,The place is a hot mess right now & no one seems to be aware or care. PC's do majority of the work while PM's get paid for it. Lack of communication & left to fend for yourself
bad,They stopped investing in some product lines a couple years before they were sold which stifled implementation of sound long term solutions.  There was much more talent at this company than was effectively utilized.
bad,I feel the company is poorly managed. There is little stability in the leadership positions. Most of the employees are great. There is some room for advancement only if you start at a lower entry level position.
bad,There were days I really enjoyed it. But most days I wasn’t too keen about it. It’s very very unorganized and there are a lot of people within the organization that are in positions there are not even remotely qualified for. The only reason they have those positions is due to his/her best friend being the hiring authority for the position that they applied for.
bad,"I signed on with Manpower and was told after 6 month's of working as a temp at Johnson Controls - located in Carrollton, TX ,that  I would be receiving a  $3.00 raise , and a permanent position, which turned out to be a lie , I found out , after working there 7- month's , I even talked to the HR- Manager , My Supervisor , HR- Director about what it would take for me to become permanent ! And the only response or feedback I got was ( Manpower Needs To Calculate Your Hours) ! Mind you, I was only making $11.00 and hour through Manpower!! While this company makes Millions and Billions of dollars  on the Commercial HVAC Equipment  that is being built here at this facility  !! Needless to say , I felt very took advantage of and used!! "
bad,"As a supervisor I am accountable for production, quality and safety.  Our equipment is very dated and maintenance is completed only to keep presses running, not solving long term issues.  Constant pressure for production when you have little control over what runs."
bad,"Working for Johnson Controls manufacturing is Fast paced, High Demand requirements. Duties would often change frequently based on the needs at the time. Local Management is supportive but the corporate support is not. The corporate management lacks communication with their manufacturing facilities, pushes changes and initiatives with communication or feedback, does not have good systems for suggestions, and often does not want to put the resources into significant improvements."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,Was hired for day shift but I started on swing shift- was supposed to be temporary for a few months. Ended up being over two years. They kept telling me I would be on days soon but I never made it. Just felt like they kept telling me that so I'd stay. Then they fired the manager that hired me. When I talked to the replacement about my situation he said he could not honor someone else's promises. So I found a new job.
bad,"For a global organization I was shocked at the level of unprofesionalism that was displayed by the management team.  There is favoritism, jobs are not being posted, they are just given to friends, and sales leads given to the favorite friend or employee.  The training program in the fire & life safety division is TERRIBLE.  Sales reps are giving proposals to customers and don't understand the system they are writing a proposal for.  The benefits are so expensive for such a large company.  The deductibles are large and don't encourage employee wellness.  This place looks good on the outside but is a nightmare internally.  RUN"
bad,24 hours 7 days gets old after 20 years will make you feel like you are not getting any support   Good benefits. Poor corporate structure headquarters completely disconnected from what it takes to run a plant level
bad,Too many changes in upper management with too many personal agendas. At once was a very good company to work for. Now it is all about the upper managements bonus and how they can make every good plant go down hill.
bad,"Poor management, especially in HR function. Company was still struggling with how to move forward in the market, but I left before the Tyco merger... and i've heard it got worse from there."
bad,"Depending on your personality this will be great or it will be a nightmare. Middle management has some really bad apples and then some gems. It's a unionized environment which comes with it's own challenges. You start on night shift 'til new employees are hired and stay. There is very little turnover. The pension plan is pretty good so are the Insurance benefits. There is parking (free). It can become toxic though if you can't make abstraction of the drama and the above mentioned ""bad apples"". Otherwise it's pretty decent."
bad,When I first started at Johnson Controls we use to work 16hrs sometimes. They are not organized at all plus they show favoritism to their employees. I not sure if they have changed or not.
bad,"JCI is a great place to get your feet wet learning about the controls business. They have a strong safety culture. They spend a lot of time and energy on the appearance of the company culture, when in fact the company culture is not a culture of employee empowerment. It's top-down and brutal, and this is the biggest reason I have hesitation to recommend it. Employees are constantly waiting for the axe to fall on their heads.  They have great benefits and you can learn a lot."
bad,"Unfortunately, the large structure of this organization has caused it to lose site of how important it's people are in it's daughter companies.  The company has very profitable subsidiary companies but because of a recent merge, the little guy gets very little attention and/or growth opportunities."
bad,"Management claims an open door policy;however, that is not the case. The open door policy means don't open your mouth. Too many staff are let go without explanation and it's scary."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working at Johnson Controls. The pay is not a livable wage. I started at 11.00 per hour in nine years I only bumped up to 14.80 due to multiple years of raise freeze. The management is not supportive or willing to help employees grow so they can advance in the company."
bad,"Adient plc, formerly Adient Limited, is an automotive seating supplier. The Company designs, manufactures and markets a range of seating systems and components for passenger cars, commercial vehicles, and light trucks, including vans, pick-up trucks, and sport/crossover utility vehicles."
bad,"My Manger is great. He listens and understands and seems to always try to be fair and supportive. I work for Tyco IS as a Field Service Technician, which recently merged under Johnson Controls. The guys I work with are good group and I enjoy their company though I spend most of my time working independently as we all do which is a blessing and a curse. I have control of my scheduled which gives me some leeway but it gives one a false scene of work life balance. There is plenty of Overtime. My understanding from speaking with FSTs from other areas is that my situation is not typical to the company. I do not enjoy the work because I do not find it fulfilling. Its good work not hard and for me its a good place to be till its not. All the others I work with have been there for years, ranging from 8 to 33, and there is a bit of pressure to make a career of the work as a result. My direct experience is over all positive but unless you don't mind doing the same things over and over again I wouldn't recommend this job."
bad,"Nedůstojné zacházení se zaměstnanci hraničící,čí spíše již překračující základní lidská práva.Přímí nadřízení jednají se zaměstnanci povýšeně,ultimativně,bez alternativ k oboustrannému řešení problému.Celková atmosféra ve firmě je stresující deprimující,neposkytující dlouhodobě (již více jak 2 roky nutné šesté směny a dokonce i provoz 4x12 a 1x8 hodinová směna týdně po dobu několika týdnů za sebou jdoucích) zaměstnancům právo na zákonem daný odpočinek.Pokud se zaměstnanec z nějakého důvodu stoprocentně nepřizpůsobí těmto požadavkům,následují finanční postihy.Pokud má člověk nějaký svůj soukromý mimopracovní program,nedoporučuji zde pracovat ve výrobní sekci ."
bad,"i am someone who provides guidance, instruction, direction and leadership to a group of other individuals (the team) for the purpose of achieving a key result or group of aligned results. I monitor the quantitative and qualitative result that is to be achieved. I prefer to work within the team, as a member, carrying out the same roles but with the additional 'leader' responsibilities. In order for my team to function successfully, I must also motivate them to ""use their knowledge and skills to achieve the shared goals."""
bad,Not the best place to start a career maybe a great place before retirement. The company is rather great but it's Texas locations don't seem to share the same values.
bad,"No on-boarding, expectation is for you to figure things out on your own, 12-14 hour days with regular after hour calls, extremely understaffed so you must wear multiple hats, with little effort to resolve or leadership engagement causing high turnover."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"my review of this company Johnson controls,was a good one 5 years ago but it has slowly gotten worse.management has gone down the drain,emploee moral has also.i try to keep others smiling even on a bad day,my job is the most demanding due to my exp.,but I have trained others to be as good."
bad,"Mission très enrichissante sur les projets."
bad,"Mainly worked on project invoicing."
bad,Currently working in the GWS Division. I cant say that leadership is all that good. The division is currently being sold
bad,"I've worked for JCI for three years. Work a lot of weekends. Mandatory overtime- that would be fine if the people on the next shift didn't work you worse then their own people.  They harp on safety but as soon as you point something out, they double talk you. Pulling heavy plastic boxes that are broken. "
bad,"You are free to work in your own style, growth is very very slow and highly expecting with providing very little opportunities."
bad,Good company to learn . but affects personal & work life balance
bad,"I worked for them for 6 months. When I was hired on plenty of work was available but it dwindled due to poor choices from sales team and management causing the loss the customer base. I was laid off just before Christmas. Since I was the last hired I was the first to go. Before I started I had heard rumors of them doing this kind of thing but I didn't believe it. "
bad,"Une bonne ambiance en general , poste polyvalent dans l'entreprise  personne ne fait la meme tache tout le temps et en plus 3 pauses dans la journee"
bad,"I worked for JCI Saskatoon for about 5 years. I originally accepted a position as a foreman and was given a good wage through the union agreement. Presented with many challenges which I enjoyed, I was rewarded for good achievements financially. A majority of your coworkers will be very pleasant to work with. The company itself is very profit and growth driven, as to be expected for any public traded company. They will do whatever it takes to generate revenue for their shareholders, a good front is put up for ethics and safety, but not perhaps overly truthful when reviewed from within. The greater focus on profit will come over ethics. If you are willing to look the other way a little or wear rose colored glasses... you certainly have an opportunity to advance."
bad,"The best part about working at Johnson Controls for me was the diversity of my fellow coworkers. This was not my ideal work environment; little insulation warehouse, easy work but little pay with little to bare career advancement. However, after going in with no experience, I was able to gain experience in the manufacturing/assembly environment as well as using power tools and team work."
bad,A place where I did my internship for a period of two months. I did a project to improve the productivity of a project. This involved interacting with people and coming up with suggestions. I learnt a lot of people skills and learnt how to structure any thing before preceeding with it.
bad,"Very inflexiable about overtime. Not family orientated. Weekend overtime hours are terrible. This coming from a person who doesn't mind working overtime. Great place to work if you don't have a life, family or other obligations. Great at misleading people. Don't get snowed in, no matter what they tell you it is held against you. Live in town where there is a snowplow around the corner. Live out in the country don't bother applying unless you want to camp at the shop so you don't miss work during inclimate weather. Don't get hurt on the job."
bad,"still struggling after 5 years of doing the same thing. Lack of improvement in the area of quality, and engineering. Engineering staff is severely over worked."
bad,"Logging in to start taking customer calls answered within 20 seconds; processed and excuted to the local branch for dispatch within 5-10 minute time frame unless customer was not listed in system then a manual ticket would need to be created and input into the system. I've learned various computer software applications, helped with mentoring and training new and existing employees; did special projects for upper management; enjoyed working with diversified people in a huge department. Hardest part of the job was the department was not quite organized as far as training preparation for new employees or contractors. Most enjoyable part of job was being a part of a great diversifed team and always being open to suggestions for customer service improvements."
bad,Do not make a mistake to go after money.JCI will pay you good; however; the work culture sucks big time...You wont believe that they use the F word all the time even in meetings with suppliers and management
bad,Check into them from different sources ask current or former employees just don't take there word for it. Would not recommend them.
bad,"I started at Johnson Controls around July of 2019. I only stayed there for about 2-3 months because in the beginning I knew things were going to be all bad. "
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,Good but not great work experience as it is very hit and miss when it comes to training and new starts have little to no support and guidance. I expected more from such a large company.
bad,"While working for Johnson Controls, I mastered many skills and talents that would be useful in many different fields of work. While at Jci, I learned how to properly, and safely work with electricity; industrial painting; welding; brazing; conduit, etc."
bad,Pushed to complete work after hours without compensation. Tense atmosphere in the office with constant fighting and arguing. Unpleasant atmosphere. Not a good place to work mentally.
bad,"Great local people, but horrible, unresponsive IT, HR and corporate management!  Immediate corporate termination policy for using hands-free devices on company cell phones, yet local managers call you while driving on your ""personal cell"" to avoid corporate policies."
bad,"Great people to work with, perks of being able to work from home or around important doctors appointments, within certain positions within the company."
bad,"No chance for advancement. Good work goes unrewarded. Very little opportunity for advanced training. Good work environment - clean, AC in summer, heat in winter. Clean labs for the most part. Cafeteria and parking structure are perks"
bad,"A typical day at work was fast paced and full.  I found management to be biased and not helpful with issues with other employe (even though there had been several complaints made by others about them to management and HR).  The workplace culture was depressing knowing that you did not have the support of management.  The hardest part of the job, for me, was when I said I could not do a duty but they would pressure me to do that duty although I felt unskilled or knowledgeable about the duty.  The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the clients we worked for and working with most of my co-workers."
bad,"easy life"
bad,"less than 1 day off a month, people try to make you look bad to help make their self look better. plan on not having a life at all. worst place i ever worked. management pits its supervisors against union by telling supervisor to implement rules then union files a grievance and management plays dumb"
bad,"Company merged with another company about 2 years ago and the company culture changed. In an attempt to pay for the merger costs, the company became more profit centric and less employee friendly. The company talked about work life balance but their actions didn't reflect their works."
bad,As a global organization it is very expansive and your opinion depends on what group you are in. Ask around for jci's reputation in your individual field before joining. In my case their reputation was not very good but when the opportunity came up the compensation was very good so I took it. My tenure at Johnson reinforced my industry colleagues impression of jci
bad,In the beginning the company was like an family owned business. In the year 2000 all changed to be more like a tech company. profit margins shared targets were over 15% per year growth not achievable with out job combining and layoffs
bad,"Managers give all the work to the employees to do, even managerial items.  The location is close to my residence.  There is lack of training for new employees.   Very safety oriented"
bad,"Can be fired for doing the same thing as many others do without warning. I was there 3 years never late and never got written up and was fired for nothing, even after challenging them. Terrible work place and they really do not care about you as you can be replaced."
bad,"I've worked for Johnson Controls for quite a while and they have changed drastically. At one time I considered them as one of the best and most ethical companies to work for.  Now greed has taken over. They sale work to customers and halfway deliver the job.  The pay and benefits are good but the stress, lack of direction, and zero organization is horrible. If it wasn't for the fellow employees in the field, I would have already left."
bad,it ok. not productive just a lot of people passing the buck. it is a good place to work if you are lazy. perfect for just showing up and doing little as possible while others pick up the slack.
bad,"Johnson Controls is a large and respectable company. Although in its automotive division, there is too much secrecy and employment insecurity. Our contract agreements were always being violated and so much pressure on employees to bend and no guarantee of future employment past the next contract. Last minute information that effects employee security. GM is poison to the manufacturing industry and bully contractors into compliance while breaking their agreements."
bad,"Day started early and I like that. I dident learn anything new from my time there. The managment has there hands tied for fear for the emploies filing a greavence. I liked some of the coworkers there, but most were bad."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,I love to teach new employees. Also finding new ways to improve production for our employees to make more money and save the company money.
bad,"My co-workers were excellent. Most people wore several hats, and went out of their way to assit you when you needed help."
bad,"Florence recycling center"
bad,"The best part of the job is the caliber of the people I work with."
bad,Moving several hundred jobs to Mexico devistated the workforce.
bad,mi occupavo di preparazione di sedili della MI TO ovvero tramite catena di  montaggio venivano assemblati tutto il materiale necessario per creare sicurezza al sedile dal cavo per il montaggio airbag al cavo controllo presenza persona
bad,"The company has a great history of innovation and continuous improvement, however several of the leaders in the organization do not embody the values which the company has been founded on.  Managers change frequently so it's difficult to build rapport and trust within teams and employee development is very poor.  The company offers very little to no training (depending on your position) and ""work-life balance"" is something you'll never hear in this organization.  Typical corporate america politics."
bad,"Typical day starts early with response to numerous emails and coordination of material needed for field crews and balance of day is procurement of materials, scheduling, etc"
bad,a company which in india is not in the right hands..so no job satisfaction amongst the staff
bad,As with most American corperations this place is not very friendly to people of color!
bad,Work was ok but management/company lacked common sense values toward employees and raises and pay rate was low
bad,Easy place to work in terms of the laid back atmosphere but the people in charge are hard to communicate with and dont give positive feedback but quick to let you know when dont do something right.
bad,I was brought in as a systems designer from another company and was trained exclusively by outdated computer based training that was a couple generations behind the current revisions of software and therefore nearly useless.
bad,"Days are typically hectic. There is no institutionalized system for document control on projects, change management, submittals or other standard contracting procedures. Personnel are ill equipped to manage the design/build process."
bad,Not a job that you will like have to have tough skin to work here and the work is even harder the people will talk to you any kind of why If you let them
bad,War 20 Jahre dort aber trotz alledem nicht empfehlenswert einzig die Kollegialität unter den Mitarbeitern war top
bad,Very demanding of overtime and no flexibility. Poor management with very little morale for and with their employees.Very little training and high expectations with little time to get a good understanding of the processes.
bad,I don't want to bash former employer because I signed a document.  I can't comment further.  Layoffs were unexpected and due to slow sales of product we designed.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,Great products and services; just lacked in customer service and support.  Salary was also too low for my experience and the job responsibilities.  I would probably not recommend this company
bad,"The workplace culture itself is relaxed and nice. There is often a good work/life balance."
bad,I am a very good worker I am also underpaid I've worked there 19 years I work hard for what I have but I am unappreciated there's no team work there lot of favoritism
bad,"Office politics were constant and a total nightmare. Worse supervisor ever, luckily she is no longer with the organization. Took them too long to finally realized how ineffective she was as a leader and finally removed her."
bad,"Closing down 2 days out of the week last two weeks with more coming "
bad,not good place to work for very unprofessional does not like to woke with you on very important situation  like to stab you in the back and walk all over you
bad,"They lie about being hired on fulltime and benefits. They also refuse medical treatment if their nurse doesn't feel that its needed and if you see an outside doctor you get fired. They do not care about family emergency or health. Dying or not you better be at work. I loved my job. But when I was let go I was treated like trash. They lied to my face and behind my back. I was suppose to be hired on fulltime 3 months ago, but that never happened for me or 12 other temps. They lie to get you in the door and working you like a slave. But none of the things promised in your interview happens"
bad,The original company I came on board with was Simplex/Grinnell which recruited me to come on board through a agency.  The original management team and staff was very good.  Six months into my new position we were acquired by Johnson Controls which completely changed the management structure which caused many great employees to seek other opportunities.
bad,"Holland HR & Plant Mgmt make promises and then follow the company line.  ""We are family""...but not really.  JCI has become a shell of what it used to be. All about shareholders and employees come last.  Money is decent and the floor folks are great, but the corporate ""promises"" just aren't worth it."
bad,Tyco's IT strategy (Keep the lights on until software/hardware dies) had a negative impact on the IT strategy and staff at Johnson Controls.  I would not recommend working at Johnson Controls if you are in the IT field.
bad,"you work 8 hours that is not bad and usually always get your 40 hours  , on call is very stressful . management doesn't help you very much . always make sure you look out for yourself because they are not there to help you . they are there to help the company and there assets"
bad,"Es una empresa en la que el ambiente laboral se torno ríspido, es difícil que el personal logre por méritos  una carrera dentro de la empresa. La planta carece de una identidad propia. El personal dificilmente puede aportar, no hay una planeación y se trabaja para el corto plazo."
bad,"Poor middle management. They expect employees to work long days and are not big on flexible work arrangements - working from home, part-time, etc. The best part of the company is the people."
bad,"Although the pay is great, the culture is of entitlement. Impossible to establish yourself, planning is horrible, expectations are unrealistic and vague."
bad,The Holland Plant in Ohio is one the most difficult environment to work in because of the disorganization and change of plans continuously. You get fired easily.
bad,"Systems are tedious and one simple task could take 30 min plus due to poor guidance, slow computers, and buried information.  Reps are undermining coworkers by selling too and working in others territories without notifying the rep of the situation."
bad,"Very dirty environment, Lead and acid everywhere. Hours were fine but the heat..oh my god was unbearable sometimes"
bad,"I enjoyed the work at this company for the most part.  It involved sorting the incoming mail and then distributing it throughout the company we worked for.  Answered calls from client and entered any work into the work order system we used, and assigned to technician.  Did routine PO's but it got out of control when asked to do more extensive PO's."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"It was good working with this company, management and co workers were good, but only thing which was not there was growth."
bad,"It's an ok place to work, incredibly strict on safety. They provide you with anything you could ever need, but don't get hurt, they'll let you go immediately even if you follow the policies and steps to properly report an injury."
bad,"If you're looking to excel in dealing with office politics and bureaucracy, this is the place for you.  The company loves restructuring to create new management roles for fellow managers. It's a common occurrence for jobs to be eliminated.  The internal communication you receive is non-existent unless you develop internal contacts to provide insight. Often, you find this information out via the local news reports instead.  The seemingly throw together projects haphazardly, spend a bunch of money, and then shut it done."
bad,"Long hours when everything was busy, downside to that was when auto industry changed so did the plant, we mirrored what the customer did - if they were busy so were we, if not the same was true"
bad,"I have enjoyed working at the Telford metals plant in a number of roles and have many friends within the business."
bad,"Being my first factory job, I learned a lot during the three years I worked there."
bad,"Bottom Line with them was cost. To many people involved with jobs."
bad,Work on high turnover rate and put people in positions that are qualified. Work on fairness between each shift.
bad,"Great place to start a career, company provides good entry level training to learn the HVAC industry and its products. Any experience one attains with this company will look good on a resume. It was determined through my time with the company there is a pattern of employees leaving the company once they attain experience, turnover is high."
bad,the management does not support its employees and views them just as numbers. Employee morale is not viewed as a priority. Existing employees are not paid what outside hires are paid.
bad,"hard job, hard on your body. You will make a lot of money but they will work you to death your first 120 days. not very understanding management like they talk about on the first day."
bad,Cant really comment about Johnson Controls although have worked there for a year. Current merger means that the business isnt currently aligned and still more work to do.
bad,JCI bought our company in 2005.  It was hard enough doing business with the company I was before but even worse after the merger. It took several more steps to do my job and any attempt at doing your job efficiently only meant more scrutiny from the powers that be.  I cringed at the thought of asking questions about things for fear it would open up another can of worms which meant more policies and steps to follow when it came to doing tasks.
bad,People are awesome to work with. Management is horrible. Salaried employees are very good at passing off their responsibilities to the next Therefore they dont have to be accountable when some doesnt go as planned.
bad,"A very demanding job that required a very demanding schedule. Definitely a job requiring training but little provided. Work place culture very fast paced and competitive. Hardest part of job -managing multiple projects (20+ at a time). Relentless schedule."
bad,I truly enjoy doing work for our U S Navy. We build all of Navy’s chillers for all there fleets. We get to interact with Navy Quality individuals who relate the importance of quality.
bad,"Over the past few years (and partially because of the Tyco merger), there has been a lot of restructuring going on at JCI. Because of the continuous uncertainty, it has been difficult to stay focused."
bad,High Volume manufacturing company in automotive space.  Learned about technology in clean/dry room production.  Following GE business model to cut its way to growth.
bad,"Otima empresa pra trabalhar  e ter um crescimento profissional otimo, motivo da saida baixo  indice de produção  devido montadoras estarem em crise afetou  a empresa e Quadro de funcionários teve k ser diminuído."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"I have learnt a lot through this job. Management are fair and supportive likewise my co-workers, It is a pleasant productive place to work. "
bad,"The company has great benefits and my co-workers are ethical, motivated and hard-working people I really enjoy working with.  I cannot say the same thing about top management.  That is all I have to say about this company."
bad,"Johnson Control's contract was not renewed with HP"
bad,"L'ambiance générale reste moyenne, aucunes solidarités et chacun pour soi. L'entente entre chefs et plutôt chaotique et là aussi c'est chacun fais à sa guise. Lors de nouveau intérimaires arrivant sur poste, à la partie injection petite presse il n'y a pas de formations au poste ou que très peu. Quand enfin arrive par miracle quelqu'un pour te former au poste, bien souvent un mécanicien, qui te forme très brièvement et plusieurs heures après la prise de poste ou pire l'intérimaire que l'ont remplace vous forme très rapidement. Aussi lors de la prise de poste, ou vous vous débrouillez avec la machine, il vous faut tout savoir ( sans avoir été former) si cette dernière tombe en panne plusieurs fois de suite que vous en soyez responsable ou pas, vous êtes cataloguer comme de vulgaires fainéants qui ne suivent pas la cadence et votre chef vous met ailleurs sans pouvoir vous justifiées!! "
bad,i go into work have to put a uniform. We have a safty meeting every day before the shift starts. Then I have to look at the run schedule of 6 lines. have to keep up a steady pace to make sure all of the lines stary running. I've learned that this job containes a lot of imformation and skills. thge hardest part of my job is talking to management there is a lot of miscomunication through out the plant. the enjoyable part is that everyone makes it a fun work place.
bad,"If you want to work, and are a hard worker, forget this place, unless you are ""in the click"", and where low cut tops and short skirts, and are young."
bad,"The company is too big and clunky. It is unable or unwilling to adapt. They use 80s software to manage  billing, 90s software to quote, and early 2000s salaries to pay employees. "
bad,"I was a part of the leadership team at JCI. I can tell you that if you aren't ""in the family"" you don't get any help. This is a toxic work environment that will try to kick you around. They change goals daily and don't remember what they said the day before. The best thing I can say is the people that worked under me we some of the hardest working people I have been around."
bad,"Typical workday - the shift is terrible. 11am - 8pm. You're told in the beginning that this shift is ""very temporary"". 1.5 years later, still in the same awful shift. Do not accept ""promises"" unless you get them in writing. Lack of communication is absolutely a morale killer. Trying to learn a job that is fairly specific, and there can be legal consequences when contracts are not inputted correctly. Constant changes to process and procedures and they are not communicated down the pipeline effectively and sometimes not at all. The people are the best part of the job. Many people are super friendly. Direct supervisors are great for the most part. Female supervisors seem to be intimidated by other strong females and that makes them throw their attitude around (in my opinion) and exert their ""authority"". This can sometimes make for an uncomfortable and unfriendly work environment."
bad,Middle management is stuck with non progressive individuals who will not allow you advance. Teams are relatively small but there are cliques and a lot of contractors.
bad,"Current local management is disengaged from sales team. No guidance, no training, lack of fairness, no help. Promises made and rarely ever delivered. Major changes made without notice. "
bad,Easy to get points hard to take them off that's why so many people quit and get fired. And it's a stressful job because you work with fiberglass. The people are great
bad,"It's good place to work, easy job, good pay, pay time off 3 weeks off,but you have to be fast quick thinker sometime and leaner other job's so you could work the whole line you would learn to be some kind of team leader but HR somewhat suck cause they don't really work with you they say they would"
bad,You will work tirelessly with very little respect for you or your home life.  They held our merit increases for more than 6 months when executives were receiving large bonuses.
bad,"Management is so so, it has its up and downs like most places but getting good pay there isnt worth the stress from that place. Not always a guaranteed 40 hours cause they cant make enough of their own parts."
bad,your at a machine grabbing parts hot must drink alot of water cause all the machine and press operating is very hot in there your assigned a jib once you get to work
bad,"Working in the warehouse making sure trailers are unloaded and loaded on time."
bad,"As Tyco, it was okay. As Johnson Controls Inc., I'm starting to think they're going to kill the security monitoring part of the company. They made the health benefits worse (poorer coverage, more expensive), they've lowered the monthly performance-based bonus payout and made it harder to get the full payout, haven't heard anything about getting raises this year (it's already mid-December), and they've hired a third-party company to do our jobs from the Philippines. All we ever hear about it how much JCI made in sales (over a billion in one quarter), but they don't acknowledge anything else about the company."
bad,Too much transition as company is in process of multiple leadership transitions and cut-backs due to merger. New CEO is not well regarded and CMO was recently let go.
bad,6am starts then work for few hours before first morning break which is 20mins approx. then back to work until dinner for an hour where everyone jumps in cars and goes around the corner for full English. all the lads are good stuff..
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
bad,"If you want to be used and treated like an idiot then this is the place to be, I cant believe how long I spent in the absolute hole, cant stand anything about it."
bad,"Mucho trabajo y variado, no te aburres"
bad,"Typical day consists of rotation between 4-6 different work stations throughout day, standing to assemble a specific part to a car seat."
bad,"Pre-meetings before each shift that kept each employee involved with all other shifts, upcoming events and tasks."
bad,Okay. I wanted it to be over. it was just an internship but felt more like a temp
bad,Put data in computers. Enjoyed working with the girls in the office.
bad,"Compared, evaluated and edited audio files for best sound quality before shipment to distributors."
bad,"worked the first shift"
bad,"1.Electrical Work"
bad,hard work lots of overtime but it was good money too bad it was just a temp gig
bad,"Como  é  bom trabalhar  nesta  maravilhosa  empresa,  pena  que  meus  propósitos  de vida  no  momento  sejam  outros,  é  isso  aí quem  for  trabalhar lá   será  muito  feliz, valeu.                                                                                                  "
bad,"Had 5 different managers in 7 years while in the same dept/ position. Last manager was brought up from Florida and did not know anything about Fire Alarms Systems. He was a bad communicator and would deny getting notices of problems in the field. When forced to reply by blind copying his boss and/ or attaching a read mail receipt, retaliated by find any reason to let go and after three reasons (minor human mistakes over four years) was terminated as a high risk employee."
bad,"good experience , time sense, and meeting high level people and "
bad,overall it was a good experiance untill they laid all kinds of people of and dumped a three person on me i told management and i was ignored and eventually let go because i couldent keep up so if your looking to get hired at johnson controls its a good place and good people work there but the managment needs help
bad,upper managment doen't listen to reason. once they form a view they become tunnel vision and won't listen to other ways.
bad,They provided a company  vehicle with required tools and safety equipment needed. They have numerous training courses with with diverse and relaxed atmosphere.
bad,"Son dias de trabajo con mucho estres."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,work a lot of overtime you have no work life balance because you never know if you working until the last min.  good people that is the main reason I like the place
good,They have what u call a no fault policy. They do not honor court dates Dr visits etc. We make air condition ducts in a building with no air condition.
good,"A job barely open no hrs  weekends off"
good,"I hate this place to be honest. It would be more bearable if I wasn’t making $11 an hr while everyone around me is making $25+. It’s discouraging. Where is my incentive for coming back night after night?, I work 11pm-7:30am and nothing to show. Moral is very very very low."
good,"Days at work were pretty much the same hot stressful and fast paced. I learned you half to do things they want them done. Management was kinda tough on there employees, work culture was fine,  being hot and sweaty allday was rough. The days went by fast so i did love that !"
good,It's really good if you need money fast other than that it's a waste. Management has become more distant from the employees. The company does include bonuses that will more than likely change every quarter usually for the worse. It's great if your a felon and need to get back on your feet and does pay weekly. Workplace is usually loud and smelly. Supervisors are known for bad behavior and will pick favorites. The hardest part of the job is working your heart out and not getting any recognition. The best part of the job are the people and getting paid weekly.
good,"I enjoyed the job itself. I like to assemble things and work with my hands at building things. Also, learning how things are put together was fascinating. I enjoyed working many different stations and working on different lines to learn about different products. I liked my first shift position. I was a temporary worker. I was then offered a full time position, but with a new baby, working he second shift while my husband worked 2nd and 3rd shifts at the hospital was not preferred or manageable. Due to collective bargaining, tenure got the first pick in schedules, which meant that there were no 1st shift positions available."
good,"It was okay the pay wasn't that great the old  guys were difficult to work/train with i was on the maintenance side learning ac,plumbing,and general maintenance in office building setting .Work hours were mon-fri 8hr days no overtime."
good,end of the line no room to move unless you have friends that help you stuck you will be! but you learn a lot of things that will mold you for the future
good,"When I worked there, They where in the middle of selling off the Bottle Mfg. Division. "
good,"Good Co-Workers But Poor Managment , Alot Of Drama And Problems With Managment , They Dont Care About Their Employees, Work Hours Vary But They Only Have 1 Shift , Sometimes 55+ But Some Weeks Are Slow"
good,"Yes i learn so many things as this is core BMS company"
good,"Johnson Controls sold off 70 percent of the interiors division which is to take effect in the early part of next year. This has created a large void in parts and service requests that actually get approved."
good,it wasn't team work place. team work is part of success. we had no training basically your on your own but if you make a mistake your out
good,"A typical day would be clocking in before 2:30 P M, getting your job assignments .then you would replace someone  running a machine or building a pallet.I leaned that quality is the most important thing for that job, the management was  nonsense attitude . the coworkers were nice and helpful.the hardest part was coming in or staying over with out a notice or a short one.the most enjoyable part about the job was the nice people.    "
good,daily tasks/duties:
good,the hardest part of the job is the work and you have to work at a fast pace at all times
good,It provides me good income to have a life I hate every thing about the place other then that.im a good hard worker very professional they do not recognize or promote people who deserves it I work there to have a good life financial
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"My first review ever and hopefully my last."
good,This is a global company which is strictly concerned for the share holders.  Lots of mergers and acquisition (M&A) project activities.  There is a large transparency gap between top and middle mangement.  There are pockets of very good departments.
good,"Could be more family oriented,  more descent work start times like normal jobs. Sick pay. Should have rotated week ends off. And better salary. Employees with 25 years should have better pay since we started out with low salaries.  Should be compisated."
good,"We joined as a fresher in JCI. For the next 10 months, we were not any acknowledgeable project. The salary and perks are very less as per the industry standard."
good,"Para mim foi mais um experiência e aprendizado. "
good,"easy jobs, management is poor, good benefits, Union UAW is horrible hours are long and rough. they do not care about employees there are some good people that make the job alright for the most part this is just a job and a pay check."
good,"A typical day at work was  fabrication of  all  types of  metals for heating and cooling, and fabrication for the operations of  high pressure boiler. I learned time management skills  in preparing the machines to start up . The work  place culture was stressful with inconsistent management . The hardest part of my job was working long hours away from home. The most  enjoyable part of my job was to use a wide array of my skills to complete the task"
good,I hated this job the managers were to busy trying to be friends with you or either trying to sleep with you.i wouldn't recommend this job to anyone it's horrible
good,"Empresa boa por ser multicional, porém por ter sido um serviço terceirizado, a administração foi ruim deixando um pouco a desejar. Porém, acredito que trabalhar diretamente na SEDE da empresa seja interessante."
good,Stressful with lots of hours.. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to go home. Management is always complaining about something even after procedures are followed
good,The time that I spent at ASC was pleasant but stressful.  My commute to Plano Texas was over 2 hrs. round trip I did learn a lot in my position at ASC
good,This company could be great if it was not so cut throat and if the Project Managers would teach the technicians better on how the system works. If there was a negative issue with product installation the PM's would point the finger at us the technicians when what really was happening is that they did not train us properly.
good,Management allowed to abuse employees.  HR will only back management.  Too many good employees let go or forced out by managers.
good,A typical day at johnson controls..its not the work or the job its the people u have to watch for if the dont like u..you will b gone..job is easy love the work an hours just the supervisor will always make or brake u
good,"Typical day is pounding work out like a factory. Then you have linear minded management who presses for faster work. Also, you have audits continuously, you have to have almost flawless accuracy on everything. Don't slip up on production, if you do, you will be put on a PIP, a performance plan."
good,"This company started off really great, however, they were understaffed and management was not supportive when the work load and stress levels were over compensated. The company would have been a better place if the hiring manager could do a better job at selecting the best honorable people."
good,"Continuous changeover in department management after first 3 years (approx. every 12 months after that) made it difficult to achieve goals or have any recognition of accomplishment.  "
good,"High stress work envirnment, highly under staffed work envirnment.  I am currently taking on the responsability of four people."
good,Good place to make money but as far as HR if you are a temp you can get fired quick. They will do nothing about harassment. its very sad
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,Management is not helpful and spiteful. Managers are only worried about their job security and do not fight for their employees. Too many discrepancies and negativity.
good,There are people from around 46 different nations in this facility. It is good to be diverse but it also causes many communication issues due to the lack of English speaking employees. But the worst part was the constant lying and misleading by management. I started on the assembly line and I was there for about 13 months. They would not give me a raise or promotion even after telling me how valuable i was and giving me reviews higher than the people above me. To make more money I switched positions to a machine operator and i was told that if I learned a second machine i could move up and get a raise. Since that time I learned two and a half machines and been told i have to pass a test that they do not even have made. All the while people around me that do less daily and know less overall are getting move up and they have tests on every other machine. how does that seem right? Plus you have the supervisors that stretch the rules and try to fit them to what they want or try to mislead you and just not tell the whole truth.
good,"işler  rutin  ve yöneticiler klasik, yükselme  olanakları  sınırlı.  iş  yapışta  prosedürler  çok kısıtlayıcı."
good,"Everyone is for self. Supervisors are trying their best not to get fired. They try to find a way to blame production workers for anything that goes wrong to keep management off of their backs. No one listens to anyone. Management makes drastic changes without consulting with the people who are actually doing the work and just make things harder. The day starts with a very brief shift meeting about how terrible we were the day before and what we need to do to improve. "
good,I didn't really learn to much there. everybody was like every man for them self. Nobody helped much. Management had very little connection with the rest. the hardest part was learning on my own and the best part was it being so close to home
good,BE VP Management reorganization in 2013.  Stock performing very well.
good,"Typical day at work: arrive, clock in, check to see if co workers need anything. check work area and start working."
good,"Key managers went back into the automotive industry, so the new managers lacked direction."
good,"Clocking in 35 minutes early"
good,travail agréable mais sans reconnaissance des collaborateur
good,too many family members covering up for other family members. Iv known people fall asleep on night shift and nothing gets said as they were the son of a manager
good,"My first impression was, to workers, it was just a job. This perspective was most likely do to a 7 day work week that left little time for personal growth or family. Management seemed politely disconnected. The hardest but best part of the job was diversification, ie moving from departments as needed. ""Go there..."" but little to no training, just wing it."
good,Loved my job until they stop caring about their employees they took everything thing away from us and cut our pay.
good,"Most boring job I ever had... Standing at the assembly line doing EXACTLY same thing 5 days a week/8 hours a day. Very tired and painful at end of each day. Very soul crushing, depressing as f, made me wonder is this the purpose of life? Pay is good. But I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their life there..."
good,it is ok place to work. The schedule that the company puts up for employees to work changes most of the time. What I mean to say is they'll ask a 1/2 hour before your shift is over to stay an additional 4 hours and then send you home early the next day. With that schedule you can't make plans of any sort.!!!
good,Management is very poor  they don’t know what they are doing half the time  they promise you things and never act on them  they yell at you in front of everyone  they don’t know how to communicate with other departments they do a lot of unethical processes there
good,"Lots of politics involved in lower level management, employees are not treated as appropriately."
good,Hours are good if you are single or a night shift family. Stamping lead for battery cores. Management knows the best way to make products. Everyone is helpful.
good,It’s a ok place to work but to me it’s hard labor and your hands hurt from the continuous drilling and repetition movement of tools that’s the problem I had and the pay wasn’t all that good for the work that you do.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,Difficult to find your niche and save your position at the company during the merger. Positions were often changed without regard to the level of experience or qualifications. This system made it difficult to stay focused on what you were originally hired to do for the company.
good,"Sem.Oportunidade de crescimento ,gestao totalmente amadora"
good,JCI is out of touch with employees and what is needed to keep them as employees.  There’s a lack of communication from leaders and board.  There’s a lack of loyalty.
good,"Travail en intérim."
good,"JCI is pretty good but the management in Holland Ohio in 2015-2017 left a lot to be desired. Work is consistent and the turnover rate is low, which actually impresses me=job security for hourly"
good,"Excellente empresa para trabalhar, porém não dá oportunidade de crescimento."
good,"Company was spinning off on its own while employed in the seating group."
good,It's very old fashioned and hasn't changed.  They need to move into the 21st century and do things in a more automated fashion rather than manually.  It was very frustrating.
good,Workplace culture is stressful and confrontational at times with other employees.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the poor culture and poor management.  Lack of advancement options make progressing your career very difficult.
good,Contracted lead poison and had to be hospitalised and then they removed my position after 12 weeks while I was in recovery. Very sad and extremely low class.
good,It's a job get paided weekly but that don't care about your health or well being. Plenty of overtime very hot in the summer and u have to be aware of your blood lead.  Must wear a respirator all times on the production floor. They provide free uniforms and work boots and a hot shower before u leave.
good,The highland park location was declining in business. Too many employees with poor work ethics produce under par products to Chrysler Plant. People were just happy to a job and not take pride in what they did
good,Worked on Production line - 12 hour rotating shift. Fast paced work. A lot of standing. Nice coworkers. Did not see a place for advancement or use for my education.
good,"If you like working 12 hour days, 7 days a week then this is the place for you. this is not the place for you if you do not like working overtime. If you can sacrifice family time for making money, then make it while you can."
good,The work place was very fast paced. The work hours where pretty good no complaint there. Our team leader was a great person and fun to be around overall it was a ok a place to work.
good,Work place is ok to work at. Get breaks like you should get. Its a few races at work. Management could be better. Working with employees. Is very hard.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,It is good company but IT is not under a good management.  Lack of business transformation strategy other than merging.  The new IT management team is focusing on keep the light on
good,Overworked and underpaid. Managers have their favorites that they take care of.   If you speak up for yourself you are looked down on.  Job culture is bad.
good,"manager was horrible.  this survey isn't necessary.  Who really cares, who in the world will actually read the jibber age that I'm writing for no reason at all."
good,The job was stressful to the point that going into the office was dreadful. I would put that more on the manager than the job itself. The manager was very spiteful and not willing to work with anyone. But the office itself could work more on making a better environment for employees all together.
good,A typical day at work would consist of clocking in and running a set station to make a product. Occasionally I was able to observe the line and run a forklift to supply raw material and take finished goods to the warehouse.
good,"worked there for 15 years, worked a lot of hours. envirement was ok,as was management.I liked all the people I worked wit while there and enjoyed the line of work I was doing."
good,I worked here for five years and in multiple departments. Everytime I had the opportunity to advance they gave it to another non qualified employee due to favoritism.
good,"Great pay."
good,"Possui uma esquipe muito sintonizada, facilita o trabalho e o deixa mais ágil."
good,"The work was enjoyable and the people that I worked with were all good people.  Work environment depended upon the clients served, most environments were very nice."
good,Fast pace work environment. Co-Works are very Close knit family.The hardest part of the job was to maintain the ability to stay safe with in the work environment.
good,"not extremely hard work, but stressful."
good,"Go to work do the same thing day after day, go home rinse repeat. However was exposed to some industrial maintenance and knew that some kind of maintenance is what I wanted to do."
good,"Not completely satisfactory work place. "
good,Warehouse environment with flexible hours and good bonuses.
good,A Johnson Controls é uma empresa americana e devido ao seu complexo sistema de gestão a torna muito burocrática.
good,JCI Eldon specializes in automotive recliners and seat frames.  It is fast paced as production lines are change on a yearly basis.  New launches are common.
good,JCI Battle creek is very demanding.You can learn as much as you want. The job requirements never stop increasing.
good,"Too many people, i was rotating from desk to another, coworkers were nice, but management were involved in their own issues"
good,I enjoyed the work I did for KBS. However there was poor executive mgt causing us to lose 750 JC Penney stores. The company has made changes over the years merging with Bergensons that has offered more stability.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,Come in and make  sure we got what we need to run the line. I check my paper work make sure my employees get paid.
good,Lost a lot of employees in my department and we have not replaced those positions.
good,"all same as current pfizer account nothing is different. it is at the same place. with the same people. the management is the same. my co workers are the same. the hardest part of the job is the same.As  is the most enjoyable.There is not much else to write about other than  I am such an incredibly hard worker  that i feel I get taken advantage of and end up doing several people's job at one time"
good,"This place is terrible to work for, they terminated me when I had a medical condition I told them I needed to seek help for"
good,"The policies and systems are outdated, in need of fresh ideas and strong leadership. Managers in place cater to hourly demands, leaving very little leverage to advance improvement ideas. Ideas that would take the current state to the next level in production output."
good,"A typical day at work is processing purchase orders, clearing outstanding invoices, taking serviceline calls for the engineers and clearing outstanding tasks on the data base. I also look after abscence and any overtime payments."
good,1)Procurement of Various items for Chillers and Refrigeration Systems in Various Materials of Construction.
good,"Johnson Controls is a good company too work for, if they don't close thier doors and move to Mexico or another state. They are very good in taking care of their employees and it is very demaning place but fair."
good,"Very stressful job. It is not climate control. Great pay great benefits when you walk in the door, Need a change after 17 years. No advancement opportunities even tho i feel that i had the experience."
good,"not the right place and not right works or under my skills. I can't learn everything from these jobs however everything not right at all I really don't want everybody to ask me about the jobs, people, the supervisor, manager, but I can tell you some Idea if you are can speak Spanish, you don't have any skills you can be there. not to me forever thanks."
good,"I did well and continued to develop both knowledge and sales skills."
good,"Typical day: Working with internal teams on projects including design, manufacturing engineering, manufacturing, purchasing. My job intertwined with most departments in the company. "
good,"Contact centers and service offices located throughout the USA, plenty of opportunities to advance but some draw backs for anyone seeking stability going forward as several mergers and repeated layoffs every year seem to have become standard due to budget cuts. All of this despite the stocks showing profits. Overall I enjoyed my time there but with the cuts home vs life balance tipped and it doesn't look like it is getting better anytime soon."
good,"Great place to work when I started, constant pressure to meet shareholders' expectations. You can't grow a company by constant cutting. Recently outsourced corporate IT to offshore company."
good,"- Make daily production schedule"
good,"Johnson Controls is not the worst place to work for or the best, their right in the middle. Get in, get yourself together an stable, then elevate. Think of it as another step on the ladder your climbing"
good,Corporate culture and policies dictated from head office in the US made and local managements lack of accountability or ability to hold people accountable made it difficult to achieve what the district was capable off. Most successes came in spite of the roadblocks placed in front of us.
good,"weak union, two tier system, constant mandatory overtime, incentive based but no budget for parts replacement so machines down all the time. it was once a great place to work."
good,I consider Johnson Controls an ok workplace. There was some things that needed attention. Things that in a workplace could make it or break it. These things were often overlooked.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,Poor management poor human resource manager great place to make good money. Work a lot very demanding job. Overall good place to work lead environment is the bad thing wear respirated
good,Not worth health risks for pay recieved but management is excellent but has poor relationship with employees. As well as its inability to be flexible with employees as well as asking company buisness be preformed off the clock
good,"Worked, worked, worked. "
good,"Weekly meetings with the product team members. The team members are members of Engineering, Finance Member, Marketing/Communications, and Product Development"
good,The work environment is nice the people are very friendly besides management who sometimes comes off a little controlling and nonchalant No Air just fans so protective gear keeps you hot .. fiberglass everywhere so it's itching is consistent
good,"This company takes no remorse on someone who gets hurt on the job or is just not strong enough to do certain jobs.  There are plenty of methods or other jobs they could move people to, but it is easier to just push them into quieting than to place them into a better position that would be for them."
good,Very difficult for work life balance with mandatory drafting of employees every shift.  Plan on working 12 hours a day and that could be every day.  Employees become very dependent on intermittent FMLA.
good,I worked with several installers. Techs took time to explain what was required for each job. If you like to work in fast pace environment this the job for you
good,"currently under yanfeng Chinese company, the current trend leads to the plant loosing business in the next year or so.. if you are thinking of going here, i would wait until business picks up for the company"
good,"The pay scale is absolutely great, over the local scale.  But there are more cons that pros with this company.  Extremely fast paced, there are constant changes to job requirements.  JCI can be a great place to work only if you want to live there and have no personal life."
good,This company is very safety oriented which is a positive but everything else from management to organization is terrible. The most unorganized corporation I have ever worked for to be such a large company.
good,"Unfortunately this was a terrible experience of a good working environment.."
good,It is a very demanding company that is always looking for more out of it's employees without providing any reward. The people you meet across the globe that work as your peers are always a pleasure to work with and have been valuable resources in my personal growth.
good,"Great place to work, learned a lot about new systems I have never seen before and my co-workers are great, but the supervisors lack knowledge in my division, so much that its hurting the contract."
good,"Lack of good management at Johnson control limits us as employees for job advancements. We never have the equipment we need to start our job for the day, and there always something new the adding to safe but are lacking in production"
good,"The work itself was not too difficult.  The management at the regional level was poor and that created distention within the local branches.  We didn't seem to have much, if any, support at the branch."
good,La dirección de cada departamento emplea todo su esfuerzo en librar una guerra interna inútil en lugar de aunar esfuerzos en equipo para identificar las áreas de mejora reales.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,It was just an okay place to work for. Not very good company with work/life balance. Management had their favorite employees.  Decided to move some of their departments out of the country. Should have stayed in the United States.  People lost jobs.
good,"Fast pace, everyone got their job to do paper work at the end of shift to tell how many hours of units u worked on. For many people good place to work."
good,"Unfortunately for the company they place a very high importance on experience rather than actual performance for pay. People with 10+ years experience were paid far to highly despite being less productive than younger people. I understand the initial pay gap, but after a few years that gap should be minimal, and that did not ever seem to happen. Yearly raises barely met the cost of living adjustments and some years they didn't happen at all. The low pay is compensated by a fairly high bonus, up to 20% of your salary, however the bonus amount is not based on things you have control over. As a pre-sales engineer, my bonus was based on how well the Sales department did and I don't have control over that."
good,Stress and pressure are more in this company. Personal and work life is not balance. Managers does not understand employees problem.Superimpose the work on them which they dont know.
good,Overall a good company to work for. Good Benefits and competitive pay. Incentive program was great while it lasted. Employee morale needs encouragement.
good,"This global company is top heavy with VPs of all kinds. Restructuring with Tyco didn't help, more top level jobs added. Working remote really means remote on island by yourself. No orientation or proper onboarding. No development, just focus on getting the job done."
good,"There is not a positive company culture with Koch Filter. Everyone is in CYA mode and rarely work as a team. Lack of communication from the top down leaves one feeling like tey are not part of the team and whatever one does it isnt good enough."
good,"I enjoyed the diverse culture of the company and the environment was fast paced. Pretty much a sink or swing work environment, if you want to do well you need to figure out how on your own. Security in your job is lacking, but if you are always having an eye out for other positions before the fact you can probably get far."
good,"Basically the company is in a state of confusion caused by lack of effective leadership at the top. They are obsessed with having all control based out of Milwaukee, WI, but they have a  very limited pool of qualified candidates there, and therefore are left with poor middle and in some cases higher level mgt. Since the take over of Tyco the work life balance has been really skewed in favor of work, and there is no end of this in sight. Also, there have been many job layoffs with rumors of more to come so job security is perceived as very low. The people that work there are very nice but they are not supported by mgt."
good,"Great pay, no benefits. Shift work.  Type of work is awesome but very, very fast paced and high stress level with Daily changes to Emergent SOP's. Have to be top of your game every day! Work/Life Balance...atrocious. Small office, no advancement after 1 promotion."
good,management doesnt have a clue. a lot of favortism. company doesnt really care about the employees. use to be able to earn unlimited sick time now they only give u 32 hrs of sick time a year
good,"Management are pretty much slave drivers these days and expect much more than 40 hours per week.   10-12 hours per day is average, but sometimes more."
good,worked there for almost 2yrs and seen how upper management gets away with bad practices like wrongful firing of personal and has had many complaints be aware.
good,Fast paced working environment. Long shifts however you'll learn a lot working under junior and senior die setters. Decent career opportunities.
good,the manager jose in out door coils was a very disrespectful person. I would not recommend this employer to anyone. cars getting broke into by other employees.
good,"I am a current employee, I have been working here for two years. It's a good environment to work in with team work. You make seats for Nissan, but depending on your job it may be bad on the body."
good,"There was never anytime to spend the decent checks I earned,because I was always at work.There is no room to advance and the pain in my hands, was unbelievable."
good,"Serviços se sobrecarregam para uns e folga para outros."
good,"Very much bothers me to work under pressure every day regardless of the results. For the last 11 years in the JCA learned a lot, for example: English in speech and writing, production takes place in a manner productive for the company and the people at the various courses, improving work process so that was effective for companies and people to achieve goals , in communication with people, etc ..."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"Es muy buena empresa pero mi experiencia ahi es que yo ya no tengo crecimiento, no soy integrado a cursos ni a problemas en los cuales pueda dar mi lluvia de ideas. "
good,Not the best place to work after the York International acquisition. Many good relationships built during my time at JCI that I continue to value the friendships I've made.
good,"Co-workers were very freindly"
good,"visit each of my stores on a monthly schedule, inventory management, warranty returns and troubleshooting with associates for customer service issues.  "
good,Worked here under the impression that all personnel would be transferred to the new company. i was not. this is not entirely their fault. just frustrating consequence
good,"Start at 6:30 AM, work straight though to 5:30 PM."
good,"I dont like this company to work, I don´t recomended....................................."
good,"Fue una experiencia en lineas generales agradable , y bueno fue profesionalmente enriquecedora"
good,"my typical work day consist of almost daily meetins with Ford of Mexico reviewing Notices.  Making sure that the tasks from the prior meeting are being accomplished.  "
good,"In the busy season of the year, you work 7 days a week from October to April. If you don't have a desire to work everyday of your life, then don't waste your time or their time."
good,My job includes PM and repairs of various lab and kitchen equipment. The customer relationships I have built keep me focused on being the best employee I can be. I truly enjoy the relationship with my 2 coworkers.
good,"Sales manager was not a good manager.  No room for advancement, unless you want to relocate to another location.  Micro management by sales maanger"
good,I wake at 3:30am and am at work by 4:30am.  I do pre shift counts of inventory and get my daily production schedule set up before my crew gets in and is ready to work.  I handle all issue that arise with WIP shortages and scheduling of molding to accommodate the schedule that is needed to fill footprints as well as shipping schedules that might be compromised for that day.  All this is done while looking forward to the next few days to make sure we are covered in my production area so that OT is eliminated if possible on some of the other lines.  I deal with daily and weekly audits for the entire plant which does include my areas as well.  I ensure the 5S structure is followed daily and that all employees are held accountable for any mishaps that arise throughout the shifts.  The end of day email is sent out with production numbers and issues that may have kept us from hitting target that day.
good,"Aan de band staan en een deadline halen op het einde van de dag."
good,Very fast pace of work. Aggressively sales driven rather than successful outcome driven company.
good,"I would stand in one place all day and put top panels on the heating units, my co-workers were really nice and helped out alot, the hardest part was just doing the same thing over and over again for 9 nine hours"
good,"8 hr days thru week,weekends alot of 12 hr days,7 days a wk. Worked with some great people,management had lack of comunication with departments. Safety was a priority with this company"
good,Enjoyed working with my co-workers as well as the management in my department.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,No advancement
good,i work 12 hours a day 7 days a week they been doing that for past 4 years. beside that i liked wha ti did . good managers
good,Casualty of the construction environment.
good,Management needs to learn to value more their employees they shouldn't be only numbers
good,Typical work days were long.
good,This job is ok. The management organization at my plant could be better. The workers do get along just fine but its just the no chance for advancement.
good,I liked my first shift hours. Wished different departments worked better together. Not a good team environment
good,Good place to work at. Need more advanced technologies implemented
good,"Great coworkers, not an advanced HR function with limited opportunity for growth."
good,"outside of the money and benefits, everything else sucks. could not trust anyone, people were always looking out for self and trying to make themselves look good"
good,Company is too good but work culture is very bad. Good work life balance and salary. Company Leave policy is good and everything depends on your manager.
good,"Great pay,however no balance with home life because of all of the mandatory overtime they give. Health benefits are shabby considering the constant exposure to led."
good,I was very excited about company at starting but after 6 month I realised that my managers and superiors officer’s started taking my benefit to complete their target. Without understanding me and my efforts. Also I have not found  increase in my salary and post in those 2 years when I was working at there.
good,Its routinely if you make it. A little confusing at times when they suddenly throw mandatory weekends at you. Only thing that stands out about this compant is that they are always open
good,great people on the floor to work with. lots of things to learn while there to keep you busy. some upper management is lacking. getting ready to move building going to be busy.
good,Decent work environment but the upper management only cares about making their goal of units on nights so they can obtain extra compensation. Worked 6 days a week 10 hour days sometimes 12.
good,The compay appeared to have once been a great place to work but due to a change in the company plans and relocation of the manufacturing facility to Mexico the mood and culture in the facility had began to dwindle and the influx of a large number of temporary employees in roles had resulted in stressful situations for management.
good,"Pay wasn't competitive  Job advancement was limited   Not a stable environment due to fluctuations in the automotive industry"
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"challenging comapny that got the most out of their employees."
good,Good place to work.  Challenging career and lots of opportunity to learn.  Fast paced environment that has a seasonal ebb and flow.  Convenient location in Aurora.
good,"Lo bueno es el salario."
good,You can't control blood levels. Areas not secure from lead. Your lead levels get too high can get laid off. We don't get paid for working in this type of environment
good,"I struggled in my sales role at JCI from Day 1. No mentoring. Very little product training or training on tools/processes -- even after 9 days in Sales Academy.  No unity or teamwork between Sales, Installation and Service which makes it difficult to make quota."
good,"Terrible managerial stype. terrible union. seemingly no in-process quality control. far too many rush jobs. aging, poorly maintained equipment. very low skill work force."
good,I have enjoyed working for Johnson Controls. I have worked for over 20 years for Johnson Controls/Adient. I especially enjoyed the talented people that I got to work with.
good,"A nivel salarial es dificil mejorar. Es dificil promocionar."
good,"Performed loading, commissioning, diagnostics, troubleshooting and maintenance from system level controllers to end operating devices. Was working at MUSC under contract for Johnson Controls."
good,"Good benefits, buddy system management. There are times where friends with no experience would get jobs over people who have been there longer and are more qualified."
good,It was an everyday busy work day. you put in your time doing the job and you go home. it wasn't so difficult or hard to do just consisted. I enjoyed what I was doing as a forklift/ Material Handler.
good,The strongly touted open work space is a disaster. Constant distraction even with the sound-baffle system. Made it very difficult to concentrate on highly technical materials.
good,"The work culture was very competitive, when it should have been collaborative. Management could never make up their mind as to which way they wanted to run the teams, in the short time I was there they restructured the teams 3 different times. Very disruptive to customer and technicians. "
good,Pay is good. Plenty of vacation time. Has quite a bit of drama but what job doesn't?  Most of the management really does care and wants you to do well. Fast pace and some OT required.
good,"Empresa multinacional, grupo gigante mas devido a má gestão; a unidade de eletrônica faliu."
good,"Decent work place, lots of hours, ok pay. Working in the construction controls field is a brutal industry with tons of work but not a lot of good resources and not a lot of man power. Work work work work work"
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,working on an assembly line is mind numbing and boring. your hands are sore at the end of the day with nothing tangible to show for it. this job has stable hours though.
good,I really dont have a revirw of this company i worked there through a temp service. It easnt really a bad environment and inwpukd encourage oyjers to work there. Just wasnt the environment for me
good,"This is a global company that treats it's employees like it's a regional company.  Very unprofessional management team, and poor training.  It was a shocker to see so many deficiencies in a company that should have it all.  "
good,This position was in support of Desert Storm Army Aviation Commanding the Southwest Asia Base in Abu Dhabi - UAE. I handled all technical data and manuals for rotor winged aircraft to support maintenance modification activities.
good,Local branch depending on the management is a great place to work but very corporate driven by share holder results very high expectations of employees
good,"My colleagues were what made going to work each day enjoyable.  We worked hard and played hard together!  Our goal each day was to work with our business partners, understand their requirements and move IT projects forward and to completion."
good,Things move much less quickly than companies I've worked for on the west coast. Not a marketing culture. Engineers and product managers can advance (slowly) but really no upward mobility above director.
good,"Company management had low to no integrity and work was very hectic and did not operate by a plan. Safety was not a priority for the company. Co,many was more concerned with doing the job and getting paid but not doing the job right or safely"
good,"From what I've heard about big business in America, JCI fits the typical example. Very compartmentalized and efficiently moving jobs to the least expensive solution to make that bottom line. Corporate oversight slows or stops action plans and improvements where it counts on the manufacturing floor and offices."
good,"Enjoyed my 7 years.  I was not micro managed.  As is typical in the outsourcing sector, contract was lost on competitive rebid.  It was nice while it lasted."
good,"Very fast paced. Very hard to move up unless you are friendly with supervisor or manager. Pay rates unfair, paid the same as someone doing a less challenging job as you."
good,"Under general direction, responsible for the design configuration and operation of the complete building control systems including fire and security and other low voltage control sub systems."
good,"Currently, upper management is unqualified and unprofessional. The employees at the branch that actually do honest and productive work are the ones treated unfairly."
good,Coworkers work good together. Pay is better than most surrounding suppliers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the company picnic. Workplace culture is H.P.T. ( High performance Team) learn of the biz and where you stand as a company.
good,"Management expects perfection, nothing less, and does not approve of mistakes. A typical day would include working hard, ensuring that all orders have been processed without errors."
good,"Constant production of one singular product model. Not to much change in experience, or, furthering of experience. Overall it was a worker drone production job."
good,Not really a bad place to work but you do not know from day to day if you are going to run production when you go in. They will sent us home with no pay if we do not run.
good,"Company is good. But job security is not there."
good,Zero leads or existing accounts to work with.  Sink or swim.  I have been there now for 10 months and still have not been assigned a territory.  My boss barely speaks to me and there is very little support when needed.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,Johnson Controls was an excellent place to get detailed on the job training.  There were several veteran workers willing to explain in detail most aspects of being a technician.
good,Wonderful place to work.  Very family oriented.  Management isn't so great. Also too many layoffs.  Schedules may vary depending on work load and assignments.
good,"Large company, impersonal. Great product , poor management.Loved what I did and the people I interacted with,but the management and supervisory team were cold and unsupportive."
good,"still working out the kinks with Tyco/SimplexGrinnell 70 B in annual sales, Multiple divisions with significant market penetration in USA and globally."
good,"Good place to work, but poor management left us with a dog eat dog mentality among the crew.  The immediate freedom to do what you where responsible to do was great at the beginning but then came the image seekers in the front office, and it all slowly started going down hill to micro managing, that created an environment among the crew that wasn't desirable."
good,"my job over the last year at JCI has been a decent job for a welder coming straight out of school. It allowed me to get some ""on the job"" experience to then go out into the workforce with a little more confidence. The repetitiveness of the production side is not something I can't deal with on a long term basis.  There is no challenge and I do not feel a sense of purpose that I need out of a career."
good,Something new just about everyday. Learned that documentation is a must in this company (CYA). Everything is great until its not. Hardest part of my job was giving the same information to management in 10 different formats. The most enjoyable was the group of guys that i worked with and that i learned something everyday that allowed me to move forward in my career.
good,Johnson Controls is a well run company.  The JIT environment is fast-paced and intense.  I liked the pace.  The expectations of management of the company were high.
good,in the short time i worked here i found it to be overall a good place to work with great employees management were also very understanding although work was hard and sometimes boring teamwork was essential here to work in a harmonies fashion to get the car seats out and loaded in to the lorry.
good,"JCI is a very high paying job with plenty of opportunities to make money, so much in fact that they FORCE you to make money. It is very stressful and very high paced. Management will terminate your employment for very silly reasons however, so good luck staying employed until you can get into the union."
good,Its your typical corporate us company how do we make the most money and not pay employees. If bottom line numbers not made its bad day for everone but there is no set schedule of what to make everday its just poor managament
good,They are always looking for amazing talent to add to their organization.  If you can create value to the organization then you will be successful.  The culture is very diverse with some pitfalls of passive/aggressive behaviors.
good,Frequent RIF's and somewhat hostile management ... The pay is good but the life/work balance was difficult to endure long-term which ultimately leads to employee burnout... had very hostile business reviews every Monday after hours... great place for trainees to get experience but they moved on once they were experienced...
good,Organization is struggling with the integration of two large companies and merging cultures.  The company has promised a significant savings to the street and is cutting growth projects and good people.
good,I found working for Johnson Controls challenging and rewarding. Organization had troubles identifying divisional strengths and using them across divisional needs. Management could be very distant in body and mind from assisting managements needs.
good,Good pay. In house employees were not receptive to having contractors on site. Difficult to complete tasks and created a poor working environment.
good,"Le travail en équipe était très agréable, le contact au quotidien avec les prestataires était très enrichissant en terme de connaissances."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"Ótima empresa para quem quer absorver conhecimento"
good,Johnson controls is by far a clean working area BUT employees are under paid...for their 40 hour week. And then run ragged.
good,"line brazier fast pace '' placed copper on a/c condenser coils & brazed sent units down the line loaded coils in oven ,bent copper ,work in base rails . I learned how to work safe at a fast pace . learned a lot about how a/c units operate . had a great set of co-works learned a lot from them .hardest part of my job was base rails lifting them 10 hrs  a day they get pretty heavy after a while . the  most enjoyable part was the friends I made while I was there"
good,"The management were ok majority of the time, however sometimes we felt they lacked support. Things would only seem to matter if the idea was theirs."
good,"Overall has been a good place to work, but currently job stability and and the vision of the company have been compromised."
good,"It's a good day everyday at work. I learned how to build seats and door panel for kia supplier.Management is fair, just need more information on what's going on at the facility. The co-workers are nice. There is nothing hard about the job. The most  enjoyable part of the job is that i've learned to better myself and strive for better production everyday, and most importantly getting paid weekly."
good,"Iedereen heeft een eigen werkstation waar iedereen elk een onderdeel vervaardigd om zo tot het eind geheel terecht te komen."
good,"A day on the job could last anywhere from 4 hours to 16 hours, i learned how to use tools and how to run some equipment, the management was decent, the hardest part was the 16+ hours in one day"
good,"Decent coworkers, was let go because factory shut down. "
good,"I have learned that firms need to develop the knowledge pool of the organization. Great ideas and suggestions are known, we just need to find a way to tap into our employees potential."
good,"organizzazione insufficente, l'ambiente sufficente,manca la meritocrazia vai avanti solo con raccomandazioni"
good,"you will not be able to move up within this company and i spent almost 3 years there for nothing i had no time for me or my family, although the money and the benefits are good its still not worth it."
good,"I work with a number of different verticals - Big Box Retailer, Industrial, School Districts, Higher Education, and Government Facilities. "
good,the jobs can be difficult and the management is lax. The pay and benefits are good and there are 4 weeks out of the year we have off.
good,"A place to work, few hours.  Long ride.   Pay is ok,  but very few jobs in   surrounding area."
good,"Very unorganized and unstable. Management is terrible. But, the pay is good and the workers are good to work with."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"York Heating and Air Conditioning was an excellent company until Johnson Controls bought the company.  Their (JCI) lack of knowledge in the industry, products, and markets set the company back ten years.  Their corporate ego also hurt the company greatly."
good,"On any day of each morning you don't what to expect if you have to work hard or easy, but all depends on where is the batch is in which kettle I learned a lot from the time stated to process to end of each process. I worked in textile for 4 1/2 years and it's took a total 360 for  me for learning different things to do in one department. There not to much to say about management ""NOT ORGANIZED, AND FAVORITISM"". Working with my co-worker was well manage easy to work with, and I work and communicate with the workers I kept work related. The hardest part of my job was when equipment don't work and by wearing full PPE in a hot environment get very frustrated tiresome out there on the mezzline. Most enjoyable is that you can take showers and go home when you have hard day from work."
good,It's a challenging company where you are very busy. The days do go by fast and I have polished my skills in both operational and corporate recruitment. This company is constantly changing and looking for ways to improve productivity and streamline it's processes.
good,"A typical day at Johnson Controls consist of:"
good,Working for JCI Automotive changed in 2008. The current work environment is one of regular organization and management realignment. Focus is on short term goals.
good,"A lot of good people there but upper management will layoff as many as takes to to meet year end share holders expectations and maximize their own bonuses. Twice in ten years over 10-15,000 at a time."
good,"travail agreable, entente avec les collegues, travail dans la bonne humeur. Peu d'opportunités de développement personnel. Mauvais management les derniéres années "" vu le systéme américain"""
good,Very enjoyable working with outside company personal
good,The management doesnt care about the employees at all as long as your making the parts is the bottom line
good,"worked 7 12's for weeks at a time, no consideration or plan for employee's needs."
good,Company across 15 countries.Recently got the award for Most Ethical Company.Very Strong in Integrity and Ethical policies.
good,No hay crecimiento laboral pesima administración lt
good,"There is no team within this company. Compensation is not provided for all the hard work, and/or all the job duties expectations. Human Resources department is not helpful at all, therefore as an employee you do not have any support."
good,its a 12 hour shift all the time i go in change then punch in then go out to the floor besides my lunch and 2 breaks its safe production of as many batteries possible we can run
good,"Johnson Controls has a tremendous presence in the industrial refrigeration market and however has a greater focus on cost reductions than strategy execution and growth. This culture has driven to lay-offs, budget spending freezes (at the cost of strategy and growth), ring freezes, travel freezes and generally tight controls on raises and advances to existing employees. This has led to supply chain issues regarding reliability, quality and relationship issues due to extended payments/non-payment and tough negotiations."
good,"Must be willing to adapt to change, when working here. "
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,it is a nice place to work as long as you are truly prepared to work.  This is not the place for you if you are a slacker and are not ready to go above and beyond
good,"Overall my time with JCI was mediocre, I did notice favoritism and some management did not have good  people skills. It took awhile for me to get all my credentials for my computer and other things."
good,Fair opportunity to learn different skills  Poor management. Typical large company management operation where they have their friends and other people who just wander around.
good,It is okay to work there but hot and dangerous you have to wear uniforms take showers with. D lead soap the respirators you wear are not comfortable also you get bloid drawed monthly to see what level yours has got to
good,"Johnson controls is I descent place to work. They have good benefits. The pay could be better, but it is comparable to similar jobs in the area.  I had 450 hours of overtime last year."
good,The pay and benefits are great at Johnson-Controls but I had to relocate to find Bette opportunities for me and my sons elsewhere . Happy that I worked there but it just wasn't for me
good,Huge company to big for their own good. Benefits of working for such a large corporation are the benefits great insurance and matching 401k lots of room to grow. Downside very incompetent middle management dehumanization of employees.
good,there's a lot of tension and demands on the workers. not much morale going around and no balance. benefits are ok but not great. compensation is ok as is time off.
good,"Oversaw all operations including but not limited to new customer acquisition, subcontractor recruitment, installation scheduling, staff hiring/training, and post-installation support providing years of strong customer allegiance."
good,check coworkers progress on repairing and maintaining hvac equipement.I learned how to deligate work.The management was ok but a bit reactive instead of proactive.The hardest part of job was the poor condition of the equipement we had to maintain.Fixing something that has not worked for years was enjoyable.
good,Worked there for 4 years.  Had 6 managers.  Every Christmas get ready to squeeze your butt checks and pray you make the cut as they lay off people at that time.    All to make their numbers align.  Change their policies as often as you change your underwear.   Lighting division is horrible.   They have their favorites and if your not on the list expect to eat up your vacation days just to get a pay check.
good,With some many domains/departments/different systems across said domains it's difficult to determine whose responsibility work is. Commission is a hassle to receive and countless spreadsheets are needed to manage it. Upper management is often disconnected from customer needs and the struggle customer-facing employees deal with on a day-to-day basis.
good,"at Johnson Controls, you are treated like a number i was hoping for better things after the spin off when it became Adeint but everything stayed par for the coarse"
good,Management is not professional at all times nor do they keep promises made to employees.  Employees do not feel appreciated.  They have a decent pay scale but no room for advancement as promised in interviews and from interactions with management.
good,"Pois bem nunca tinha trabalhado na vida, essa empresa meu deu a chance que esse fosse meu primeiro emprego na vida. Inicie minha carreira no mercado de trabalho como aprendiz, e além de trabalhar eu tive a oportunidade de estudar, isso me proporcionou algo que foi muito único, uma experiência magnifica que não é todo mundo que tem essa chance. Aproveitei ao máximo todo aprendizado e conhecimento que as pessoas com quem trabalhei me deram, sou grata à todos que me ajudarem do início ao fim meu caminho nessa empresa."
good,Job wasn't what i was told it be spent more time doing things a line worker should be doing never felt so under used and overqualified for a job before in my life made felt like i worked so hard for so many years to be lied to and pushed backward. Lead was very self conceited and didn't want anyone knowing what he did and he didn't like being show up .
good,"They have lot of different branches , from havc ,fire, control,car batteries, customer service, building maintains . I work most of the branches work and seen if you work hard and get pay good i well gave them that , but when start to get to the top they are going fire you ."
good,"Working here use to be fun but with mergers and company splitting into different companies, the fun stared to wan.  Company does fairly compensate its employees.  Moral was at a low when I left."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,Not too many resources.  Sales ops is lacking.  PMs are lacking.  Way too much is put on the sales rep.  Sales needs more support.  Sales reps are basically running jobs when the PMs should be.
good,The hourly employees are dedicated and dependable. You can gain gratitude working with the employees. The life work balance for salary employees are skewed to the negative side. Seems the expectation is to live for work and not work to live.
good,"During the 12 years I worked there, Johnson Controls underwent 3 name changes. There were a lot of perks during its earlier days (free gym membership, etc.) but most have since been eliminated."
good,"Good place for benefits, hard work, you will end up with joint pain, weakness in your grip making it harder to hold on to things. There are a lot of safety risk."
good,"Assist with day to day IT support; serving as first point of contact technical care for walk-in end users, diagnosing, resolving, or collaborating on problem resolution about hardware, software, and peripheral equipment support to employees; accountable for imaging new PC with Microsoft Office using SCCM, and delivery of computers; asset recovery; monitoring request queues. Responsible for performing technical support functions via phone, remotely through Skype for business, providing first level diagnosis resolution and desktop repair to clients on open end-user’s deal tickets"
good,Corporate Mindset with little focus on local plant.  Poor management and lack of talent retention.  Typical corporate benefits.  Tuition reimbursement.
good,It's was a good place to work all depends on what you wanted out of life if you wanted to settle then great place to work if you want advance meant then not i good place to be starting from the bottom
good,I worked alone away from home and was compensated 10 dollars a day for food and accommodations. Not nearly enough. After helping out for a year was promptly dismissed without any consideration for what I had done.
good,"Large company with direction/opportunity to wear multiple ""hats"" to deliver product and services to end customers.  This could be viewed as double edge sword as may impact quality and life cycle delivery timing."
good,This job is very fast pace. Some of the jobs are very hard for a female to perform but management say there isn’t a male/female job. Management is very poor.
good,"There is little if any work life balance. If you are a salaried employee, you can expect to never less than 50 hours/ week, including weekends and holidays/ vacation. Future employment is unclear and management does not address it, lack of communication and honesty from management leaves office environment in an extremely stressful state. Not the Johnson Controls it once was."
good,it is a call center you make it what you need to. great people work there and enjoy spending time with them. you share desks so you can get sick often.
good,Same routine everyday no change so you will get board and tired of being there. They have unreasonable expectations and it feels like jail and you get written up easily.
good,"Very little training at the time of employment, very little support from management, specifically because they were not local to the office."
good,"Fast paced, detailed oriented."
good,Place stays in crisis mode constantly.  Get calls 24 hours a day.  Management has lost control of the work environment.  Don't seem to care about their employees anymore
good,"money is good, coworkers are helpful, insurance is great, on call rotation is good, can swap if needed to, as most places you need to always CYA, Great place to work."
good,"Productive and fast paced. union, Health ins, 401 K,  paid vacation vision dental and life insurance. Management and HR department really needs to improve."
good,"Assembly work fast paced, Management wasn't very good they would put you on a new job and teach you for 5 mins and walk away and you wouldn't see them for the rest of the day. Wouldn't come and check on you or see how things were going."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,Fast pace of work. Plenty of overtime. If you work hard you will be able to succeed. The supervisor are easy to get along with. Do your job do it well and you will succeed
good,My supervisor did not appreciate the work I performed.  The local office I worked for has a high turn over in employees. The corporation as a whole is a great company.  The people at this location were great to work with.
good,Same repeated motions day in and day out. Once you learn how to do your job properly it becomes quick and easy. Hours are always the same with a few overtime weekends thrown in. Leadership is the only thing holding this place back from being a truly enjoyable experience.
good,"My location for Johnson Controls was enjoyable (JCPenney Headquarters building), but I would not rate the upper management at the company highly.  My immediate manager was great, and I still keep in touch with my co-workers."
good,I have spent 10 years at JCI. I have earned 8 merit awards and a litany of certifications. I have two Masters degrees and have left many successes in my wake.
good,No time for family life. Some months we only had two or 3 days off. JCI sold the dash business to Yangfeng. It was a very stressful business to work for. The workers got out of control and management couldn't do anything to handle them. Ended up being a miserable place to work. The work was moved to Illinois.
good,"Great  employee's.  Leadership transition as they realign to the evolving changes in technology."
good,Management in the front office is poor in both leadership and understanding the job they don't listen to the employees on how to improve production and quality
good,"Job was basic knowledge of hand tools. Long hours 9 hours a day. 7 to 13 days straight before you're able to get one day off. Starting pay is alright, but low pay raises."
good,"I have nothing to review for this employer as I have worked as a contingent employee. With this, I basically work 40 hours per week with no leave (personal or holiday)"
good,"En esta empresa tienens que ir aprendiendo mas dia con dia para lograr subir de sueldo, lo unico malo es que tiene un tope."
good,They are moving to 8 hrs shifts only thing I don't like other than that it is a great job people are great there I'm just looking for a little more money
good,"Johnson Controls ist ein Arbeitgeber der Klassisch nach tarif zahlt, allerdings manchmal sehr schlecht organisiert ist"
good,Good place to work but not enough money. Workers work alot of overtime. PTO is great when your working for this company. Make sure you learn your job and stay on your Ps and Qs.
good,"There is room to move around here, but they don't appreciate their employees.  Have no problem running your work life balance into the ground.  Have been lied to on multiple occasions by supervisors.  I enjoy the work i'm doing but I don't appreciate the way I've been treated so far."
good,The company needed to hire more office staff. Understaffed and no team work from limited office staff. No assistance from manager to address issues and very biased. Colleague was very difficult to work with and kiss up to upper management and often gossiped more than work or helping out with work that was behind. Other departments and managers saw the problem and nothing was done. I had to quit.
good,Interesting and challenging work and great people.  Priorities and major projects change frequently due to lack of a consistent sponsor.  A great place to work to gain valuable hands-on experience as a stepping stone in your career.
good,This company has favoritism at its finest. Management ask personal questions during interviews that not apart of the job description. The best part of my day is leaving out the doors of TYCO and dropping of my badge.
good,"Johnson Controls was a good company to work for overall. Willing to pay you for your time, lots of steady work and overtime opportunities. Management and the union did their best to work out good working conditions, but that sometimes got in the way of production. The workplace was reasonable but the workforce was older and very seasoned, which added a tinge of cynacism. The hardest part of the job was knowing you worked with copious amounts of lead and sulphuric acid, which means regular blood draws, as well as union-based ways of doing things, especially when trying to be compliant with ISO standards. The best part of the job is that there is a lot of support for your job and everyone is willing to show you how to do the job right."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,Being a small export house prefer to hire multi tasking people. No employees benefit programme or fun activities. Strict on office arrivals time but no bar on late seating.
good,Most people in the IT Department are afraid of losing their jobs to low cost centers. Overall morale is low people are just looking to survive one more year.
good,"Johnson Controls boughtout ""York International"" over 8 years ago and like all ""new companies/ mergers "" changes happen.. In this case many new restrictions and new policy drive the moral and personal workmanship down.. causing many to either retire early or search for new opportunities."
good,JLL is a vendor who performs contracts for companies looking to outsource their personnel.  There is no job loyalty to employees as it is a contract driven business.  High achievers and average workers are treated equally.
good,was a good company to work for until you get to know what its like and how its run if your not from the area then you get treated different.
good,The company requires long hour and 7 day work week. Management is poor due to company being too large and hiring inexperienced people that are not from automotive or injection molding.
good,There seems to be a lack of leadership and a lack of communication with the plant I work at. Management does gives no initiative to help and expects some one else to handle the issues at hand.
good,"Moving from core business and in house talent."
good,Knowledgeable People. Motivated workforce. Work was performed in a satisfactory manner with minimal outside resources. Capital funding was spare and the aging equipment needs substantial work.
good,"Temporalidad imprevisible, Trato general malo, mucha presión innecesaria y disponibilidad total aunque bien pagado."
good,"Over all the local facility in Holland, MI is a decent place to work. Usually there is opportunity to work overtime, it used to be mandatory 12 hours; however management has changed how they account for their production and have encouraged a positive life/work balance by scheduling eight hour shifts. Good profit sharing plan, benefits for full coverage is very expensive."
good,"I liked Johnson control but the management was terrible. It is a union company so there are a lot of lazy workers who just do absolutely nothing and get away with it. Some of my co workers were very hard working while others just try to get away with doing absolutely nothing. The management wasn't all that great, we didn't have a supervisor and there were like 3 or 4 different supervisors who kept controlling us and it got confusing. It reeks with oil and the lasers were the worse. They don't put you by what they think you can handle and can't. The most enjoyable part of the job were the breaks. You get 2 12 min breaks and a 20 min paid lunch. The hours sucked as well, if you wanted 10 hours you couldn't it was either a 8 or a 12.It goes too much by seniority it isn't fair for most of the temps.Also they don't sell anything at lunch time except for the machines so it sucks if you forget to bring lunch or something"
good,"Many employees dedicated to the betterment of the organization and work tirelessly toward that goal.  Today, the environment is a bit cloud because of the many changes taking place within the BE business group.  I would strongly recommend employees from JCI."
good,Being spun off from Building efficiency.  Don't know if there is any job security here anymore.  A lot of layoffs have happened here over my 17 years.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"My typical day at work starts at 6am where I prepare a pre-shift meeting before sending my team to the production lines.  We start-up at 6:30am building 450-480 seat sets per shift while tracking labor, throughput, cost, safety and quality variables as well as attending to personnel concerns.  My typical day can last between 8-10hrs supervising 2 Team Leads, 40+ employees as well as support personnel."
good,Organized and thorough yet gave space to do your job. No supervisor micro managing you and your work station. Co-workers were always very helpful when needed.
good,"*The company is okay"
good,"enjoy co-workers, on this campus upper management not so much. HR department in our building is not helpful and lacks interpersonal skills and a sense of the ppl working there."
good,Many improvements done at one time - overwhelming when adequate help is thin. heading in the right direction with minimal staff. The team culture needs improved and is not working as intended. Maintenance Department has few senior guys and no one there longer than 3 yrs.
good,Tinha um ótimo relacionamento de trabalho com os meus colegas. Aprendi muito sobre desenvolver minhas especialidades de costura. Mantinha um bom relacionamento de trabalho com os nossos supervisores.
good,JCI will probably be around for a long time. But IT will slowly move to outside resources. No room for advancement.
good,"At work I would be in Classrooms, Hospital rooms, Mechanical rooms, Office space, anywhere there were HVAC systems. It was my job to make the temperature in these areas comfortable. Really enjoyed working with my co-workers, we were diverse, different talent levels working together for one common goal, Success. Hardest part of my job was navigating through some of the software in complicated programs, Best part of my job was meeting so many wonderful people on day to day basis, both workers and customers."
good,"Varied day to day working, with constant new intiatives and a client based focus on business priorities."
good,"Supplier monitoring(conducting supplier audits at supplier manufacturing locations)"
good,"The company is constantly in transition, always restructuring.  This creates a lot of insecurity.  Other than that, it's a wonderful company, doing great things."
good,"No Advancement opportunities."
good,Working with 2 guys in department  running a 24/7 operation.
good,We were worked way too many hours. However everyone I worked with was pretty laid back.
good,"While working at Johnson Controls there were six managers in seven years covering the group with which I was employed. When they talk about embracing change, Johnson Controls is the place to be."
good,Lots of office politics but overall the diversity is the best part of company. Very busy and productive.
good,"Comenzaba realizando juntas de equipo al inicio del turno, asistencia a juntas programadoas, monitoreo y recorrido horarios por el area y maquinaria,."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"Poor management skills higher authorities."
good,"Johnson Controls was awesome, Then became Adient big changes. Seemed to want to follow the European style of operation. Spent countless dollars to achieve a new look with no real improvement in day to day operation."
good,"No es una empresa tan mala, pero no de las mejores"
good,I've enjoyed working at Johnson Controls over the past 8 years mainly because I have had multiple opportunities to move within the company and gain experience and knowledge in multiple roles that very from national role to global roles and departments ranging from Finance to Training and Development.
good,Es  estresante el no tener una estabilidad laboral.
good,"• Always feel like you’re needed"
good,"This facility tends to operate 6-7 days a week 8-12 hours a day. The facility is ""climate controlled"", meaning whatever the climate outside is, the inside is the same."
good,JCI is full of opportunity if you're self driven and ready to take personal ownership of improving the business. Try to come in with a 5 year plan and make sure your superiors know what that is. Network. Be a team player.
good,"Johnson Controls overall a good company. Seating spun off to Adient, they are working towards going back to the basics and growing the company.  I leaned many things during my career with Adient.  Most important is team work."
good,Working at the branch I currently work for is apparently unlike any other division of the company so please don't judge them all off my experience. Local branch doesn't provide tools as needed as stated in policy so I spent quite a bit of my own money on being able to perform my role. Also did not pay for the training program I had to complete over 40 hours worth.
good,While working for Johnson Controls I only stayed with the company for a short. Of time after Johnson Controls purchased Tyco. Prior to that they were ADT and I enjoyed working for ADT.
good,The Mississauga branch is very unprofessional with supervisors burping and farting in the office. Unrealistic targets and a manager that doesn't stand behing his team. Not much room for advancement although its a huge company. much room for advan
good,Les poste sont facile à prendre en main même si ils sont douloureux
good,Responsibile for 40 sites around North America.  Utilized Oracle Enterprise Manage to monitor and alert regarding issues with the databases.  Built new clusters for lease replacement.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,You show up to work and change into your company provided uniform and then you punch in and head to your station. You get two 30 minute breaks in your normal 8 hour shift and when you are forced over late or in early always by 4 hours you get a 10 minute shift break. Pay is incentive based and is great if you are on a well maintained line with experienced workers. You will have to work there for a long time to be on one of those lines. On a good line you can take home over $1000 a week and on other lines you will take home around $500 a week. During your 120 day probation you will be forced over the maximum number of days every week and instead of incentive jobs you get to do cleaning jobs at the base pay rate which kills your average pay rate meaning the more you work the less you make. You will have no life outside the job because you will be working 6 days a week. You can make a lot of money but you will basically live at work.
good,overall wasn't too bad of a place to work. managers just didn't have time to teach you anything and the people that worked there had the time just didn't feel the need to teach. if you screwed up from lack of knowledge it was your fault.
good,"This was a good company to work for but they do not train new employers for the job.  It is difficult to learn the way a company does things when no one will help you to succeed.  My department was very short staffed, had a low morale, was not giving encouragement to their employees. Unless you are able to hit the ground running from day one do not expect to be there very long.  They are low on patience and have a high demand for learning and knowing what to do well before your probationary period is even met.  I was the 7th person to go through this position.   If you ask for any assistance from your coworkers   expect to be eventually bebecalled into the managers office.   The ""Leads"" do not train you, and they do not even answer your questions,  they talk behind your back, run to management if you ask for help.help.."
good,"A lot of childish people.they pay attention to other's rather then themselves. H.R is a joke! Upper management looks to put blame on anyone, but not fixing the problems."
good,"Direct manager was good, but work/life balance not there. Company going through significant changes over the last couple of years. Lacked communication and vision."
good,"This company appears like a winner with ethics and morals, however, after being their for awhile I noticed a lot of disturbing things. From Federal Government Collusion to many dark hidden agendas.  The Higher up you go the more dark it becomes.  Stay away! I started working and noticed my work load increased and many glitches with their NexGen System and Salesforce.  I also noticed that certain prebid information appeared to be getting out to competitors.  I believe that some of the higher ups are included in the collusion. What's better that one check?  Two!  Their is also something illuminatish with the company that is very dark. Stay away if you are a minority."
good,"long hours,one day off.poeple were unfreindly.leadmen yelling at you ,area was wet and slippery to walk on .did not learn nothing.long ways to walk to get to job area."
good,"so much work you will be worked 5-7 days a week. training is thrown to aside and not taken seriously, the set time for raises doesn't happen.  also in the company it truely comes down to who you know and not what you know. for i have seen this personally."
good,at first it was ok then management turned over and the advancement positions i was promised never came to fruition. I made the most out of my time there and was thankful for the experience.
good,"High paced company, supporting the chrysler belvidere plant. Takt time requirements for all assembly stations. dedicated middle management. Upper management is not present. Strong UAW influence."
good,just abusy place to work and just have to neat and watch what you doing. its not safe place for your heatlh they to try to be on top of blood lead just be cafwe when u work there
good,"Velmi dobra prace  , čistá a hodně dobrý lidi a hlavně hodně toho naučí"
good,"Typical office setting, great people to work with but the management and environment can get a little toxic at times. Overall great company though! I would recommend this company to others."
good,i enjoyed my job there and the people i worked with i ran a haas vf 6 cnc and a mitsibishi wire edm we used esprit'auto cad and solid works for our programing i can progam 2-d or 3-d for wire and cnc
good,"La dirección en recursos humanos, no es nada amigable, deja mucho que desear, te saturan de trabajo administrativo , te quitan mucho tiempo, con cursos y platicas, tiempo que puedes estar con tu familia."
good,Poor management communication. Great people. The environment is hot but they do provide ice machines and water. Lack of advancement is a con. It is all seniority based not qualifications.
good,"Everyone is expendable and the plant manager, quality control supervisor and the manufacturing engineer were all let go on the same day.  The manufacturing engineering manager is also to be let go."
good,"Good starting job. I worked in the position i was in for nearly 3 years. The management was good and they did lots of training to ensure their technicians are prepared to work with their equipment and with their customers. "
good,"Interned for a year and transitioned to a different role. Overall, a fast paced and productive place to work. Was unable to obtain a full time position with the company. Best Branch Manager Ever."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,Not a bad place to work at. Lots of good team oriented people. Just the shift work and how hard it is to move shifts don't work with my family schedule now.
good,fast paced production is piece rated high turn over rate very stressfull when it comes to production too many cameras to me tells me they dont trust their employees
good,"job was not stressful at all."
good,Good place to work with advancement opportunities.  Management is willing to allow you to grow your career through educational opportunities.  Great tuition reimbursement program.
good,"Supervisor, Safety manager, power tools, air tools, electric tools, hydraulic press, press brake, punch press, grip nail machine, cutting, plasma, laser cutting CNC, amada-pivatic, RAZ automatic press brake, laser machine, Forklift license (electric gasoline and propane), MES, FINN Power, Paint Both, loading dock, fork truck license, inventory management. 48 hrs/ week , 4weeks/ month for 23 years"
good,Would be a good place except for continuous RIFs and 'reorganizing'.   Good pay.  Fair policies/practices.  Nice work environment.  Greedy executives.

good,"Johnson Controls Inc. provided me the opportunity to do standup forklift / order picking/filling for twelve hour shifts, six days a week.  Very productive."
good,"I didn't mind the work it was engaging and at times challenging. I did enjoy the work the negative side was the travel time to jobs sometimes it was a bit much, though we were compensated for our time so it made it acceptable. We aren't supposed to talk bad about our previous employers so i will be brief on the management coverage, all I can say is there is much room for improvement."
good,"The discount program was great, there were a lot of benefits and discounts that employees could choose from. Being paid weekly was a great benefit as well."
good,The company offers good wages and benefits. There is a high stress level in the work environment in the managerial field.  Management is profit driven to the point of exerting excess stress on the office staff.
good,Poorly managed from the top down.  Production numbers over employee safety.  Alway cutting jobs giving more work to already overloaded workers.  No sick time.   Not family oriented.
good,"Not a bad Company to work for; not much scope for progression unless you want to go into sales or business. Salary is substandard, but some benefits available."
good,You do what they tell you to do when they tell you to do it. and mandatory overtime. Management was good most were promoted from within. The job itself wasnt too stressful but could be very difficult to get used to the speed of things.

good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."

good,"friendly enviornment, nice atmosphere, can be kinda loud sometime, not many freetime hours, they expect you to be there quite often with little regard for your personal life"
good,"this place was cool for the most part, just you worked on your own with machines, so all the heavy lifting was on your own, the problems were on your own, but overall it was cool"
good,"Ambiente lavorativo fantastico, colleghi sempre a disposizione per qualsiasi tipo di aiuto. ma scarsa stabilità e costanza del lavoro."
good,"There was no typical day, lots of variety. Installed conduit, cables, control panels, termination. install devices."
good,"The company itself is fine to work for. the people here, the homeboys and city click and the difference of rules from 1st to 2nd shift is the only problem with this company. note: go to work and stick to yourselves and you'll be fine."

good,"day starts at 7:00 am til 3:30"
good,"Coordinate all Engineering activities within the department, execute capital projects, supervise all equipment installations, see my resume for more information."
good,Management varies from department to department which leaves room for much confusion and no consistency. Has the potential to be an amazing company if they would stop merging and venturing into other realms of service. It is a revolving door at this place.
good,"Good paying job, its just a lot of hard work. to work at Johnson Control you have to be ready and welling to work 12hr shifts multiple times thru out the week. You have to take shower after everyday of work to clean the lead off you so you don't track it at home"
good,"Managing reagents through a management system. Fulfilling chemists request for handling and disposing any hazardous materials. Making sure that every labs on site are safe to work in. Keeping good relationships between co-workers and clients is very important. Making sure that communications between upper managements, co-workers, and clients run smoothly to minimize errors.

good,Bardzo dobre miejsce na pierwsze szlify i wypłynięcie na głębsze wody po kilku latach.
good,"benefits, bonus, pay are strong.  Plant is hot, dangerous, and management doesn't oversee production.  Managers hide in offices and have no clue about employees, half hiding themselves because there is no accountability."

good,you can be out of the company any time which is not secure place to work in. not good policy of terminating people without a reason
good,"Scope of work was different day to day."
good,Fast paced. You must remain flexible at all times. I've learned how a Pharma company operates. The management staff is inexperienced at managing people.
good,"This is a great company to work for at a branch level IF you have a degree in engineering or are a union mechanic, otherwise there is no room for advancement. The corporate office in Milwaukee has great opportunities and it's easy to advance your career in any direction, I am told."

good,I learned all I know about Industrial Refrigeration from this company.

I assisted in processing the monthly union remittance reports for roughly 300 U.S unions, while also updating fringe & wage rates as necessary per the unions collective bargaining agreements."
good,"Managers have no common since and are extremely lazy. but they are so good they can tell you how to do your job from the desk, and have no idea what you actually do."
good,Johnson Controls is an excellent company to work for.  Although they are going through some changes at this time.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,expected the unexpected but be willing to do the best of the best to make the customers happy
good,"A typical day at work consists of starting off my duties including First piece inspections of the molding area. I also do first piece inspections of all other areas of the plant. Light paper work and filing.My Co workers and I work in groups or alone to complete our daily tasks. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the production area when the first piece inspections find bad parts. However, I enjoy the freedom of my job being able to muti task and make my own decisions after management leaves for the night."
good,"O dia era bem estressante mas com os colegas de trabalho sempre ficava melhor, eramos bem unidos. "
good,JCI offered great training opportunities and growth and development.
good,Service maintenance of building services in major office complexes & industrial units
good,"Production line enviorment, not much interaction with fellow employees. Night shift was hard to adjust to, but it eventually worked out to my schedule."
good,Good company with good management.  History of sustainability efforts and corporate giving.
good,"My employer Johnson Controls is contracted by Agilent Technologies for their facilities operations and management.  My position as Admin Assist / Concierge involves day to day greeting of visitors and employees visiting the site.  A lot of computer work and meeting reservation requests.  I create all of the work orders, purchase orders, enter labor hours, track invoices, maintain our preventative maintenance module in our Facilities Management Platform.  "
good,"hard driving results driven company, diverse workforce and many options available to the employee"
good,"A typical day starts with a meeting, once on the floor head to work startions, where we work every 2 hours and rotate to signed work startions. We get a 12 min break with a 20 min lunch.

good,"Daily dialogue with the key members of the project stakeholders, management of the sub contractors and the upkeep of their agreed deliverable's."
good,"JCI is great company for the most part, I enjoyed my work. Hours were long but the results satisfying for the most part. Would have been better if management could have figured out which direction they wanted to go in. Consistently changed work specifications and had his favorites who did no wrong. If you weren't the ""clique"" your job security was minimal. "
good,"Well, i was a machine operator, working  around a lot of lead,"" this was because of what the company created. which was batteries for trucks, computers, etc. So because of the toxic environment, every employee had to wear rubber protective mask for eight hours each day."

Learned how seat and doors was made and all the parts it take to build .Management is successfully managed an handled .Co-workers are great hard working an helpful when you need that helping hand or answer to problem you my run in .The hardest part of the job is carrying the materials to the production line going to to find the parts that run out in the plant.The most enjoyable part of the job is the job itself ."
good,"As a JCI contractor at Agilent Technologies, my typical day starts with audio visual setups (tables and chairs, audio-conferencing, laptop projection, microphones, and/or meeting support). From there my responsiblities continue with facility management support. This support has helped me acquire basic knowledge of electrical, HVAC, and plumbing. The hardest part of the job is being a contractor and not feeling a part of the Agilent family. The teamwork at JCI makes up for that feelings with a great support system."
good,I like the fact that it is a fast paced job environment and u can get a lot of overtime.
good,"This job was somewhat hard,challenging. I learned how to keep up with fast pace workers and not to miss work as much as possible."
good,At times there's no communication between staff and line workers.
good,"A global leader in the industry, it was an honor to be part of such an organization that is known worldwide.  The role enabled me to further hone my expertise in the field of Marketing and Communications"
good,at my time at JCI I was able to manage my projects with little supervision. Company has changed over the last couple of years but have work with some amazing people. Recently laid off due to no work available
good,"Drove company vehicle to and from various job sites to work on fire alarm and security systems. "
good,Good work  culture and good work life balance. Stable company with lots  of perks to employees. Great support from Management team. Innovative digital labs
good,"Management dont work together and management show favors to certain co workers and Supervisor. Great company just not fair across the board. Company should do more for the associate like cookout, birthday,and giving out Johnson Controls apparel."
good,Hardest part of the job was getting used to any machine in the workplace. I was constantly moved around the building from machine to machine. The morale in the workplace was pretty low also.
good,"Not there long enough to bother, since I was only there 8 days or so & while I was there the person training was sick most of the time."
good,we have a team work and friendly work environment in Johnson control. people love to do their job and noone has any major issues or difficulties to do their job.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"Mandatory overtime,They won’t let you know till about two hours before you get off Weather you have to work 16 hours are no.Not very family oriented at allt"
good,"JCI provides decent skills to those entering the industry/workforce. The company's size stifles it's efficiency and productivity, and there is a lot to be desired from management, including hiring standards. Overall, it provides a good life/work balance, decent salary, and ok benefits."
good,"High stress, fast paced, over tasked. Job expectations are unreasonable for one person to accomplish timely and accurately."
good,I don't have a review of this because I liked it somewhat and somewhat I didn't. I mean the job was pretty easy it's just that I had to lift heavy metal materials.
good,It is good to work in all parameter and very challenging to complete the work which was assigned to me. Overall this was a good experience. My sub originates is very supportive.
good,"Outside sales so you are working alone, you have a team in place but it is all about finding your own business and leads. Manager is great but the company as a whole has some dysfunction. its improving."
good,"usual 8 or 12 hr shift"
good,"There is opportunity to advance and pay is decent however newer employees make more money then tenured employees and there is no value placed on retention or loyalty of current employees. Middle management is stagnant and does not present as leaders instead of bosses. Workplace culture generally reflects the lack of leadership and desire to effect actual change. There is also a value set that the company purports to follow, however there is no actual emphasis or enforcement of the values."
good,"Busy department"
good,My work experience was good with Johnson. The work culture was good. There were several opportunities to improve career. During my time there I progressed from accounts reconciliation to Finance Analyst.
good,"Las instalaciones son adecuadas sin embargo las personas que son los jefes inmediatos y los compañeros en cada área, no saben y no deben mezclar o diferenciar lo laboral con lo personal."
good,Assembled AC unit from the ground to the top very fast pace sometimes you'll be all the big units and small units ours weren't too bad to work from 6 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
good,"No clear defined mission. Not sure what is coming next, or if anything is coming next. Lack of standardization within the organization. Many management changes."
good,Culture was dated and slow to make changes. Best part of the job was closing big projects. Also meeting people all over North America. I learned a lot about managing people.
good,No body was on the same page. Lack of leadership throughout the whole plant. The union seemed to be against management all the time. They wanted me to go to 3rd shift maintenance supervisor from maintenance planner.  I had to resign because of to many conflicts
good,"factory culture , some managers were in the wrong roles they did not understand ,non sensical tasks were requested ,straight forward at first but role was not developed in a linear fashion"
good,"Enjoyed my tenure there . Excellent field to work in . The scope of work is unmatched as long as custoner service comes first . Training , and safety is applicable to many facades ."
good,This JCI would provide employees great working culter/ environment. They are providing sufficient leaves to spend time with family. The increment is low.
good,HR is terrible and unfair black worker.Its a union job that . Some of union stwart r don't like black people and it they hire u have a run in one them they with get u fire
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"Loved it at times, but once I started learning the people and how they work daily I really fell back from that work environment. the job was kind to me but to other new people trying to work it was hard for them."
good,"People's attitude is very bad Including manager."
good,the management was sub par. nobody seemed to be able to agree on procedures for production. it could be chaotic at times due to lack of clear direction
good,It has the potential to be a great place to work it would be so many politics involved . It’s pretty safe to pay is decent and there is quite a bit of overtime which is mandatory but if you’d like to work OK I just had to deal with the politics is a pretty good job
good,"I start my day at 5 a.m. and start testing valves and recording all the serial numbers for more valves that need to be tested."
good,"Cons:"
good,"It is fun working here because you will learn a lot from the people here. They will let you grow, sending you to lots of training for your continous growth and your ideas matters to them."
good,"there were personality clashes at the office I was in, an not much management backup. Also pettiness among employees, as in talking behind others backs."
good,"Learned a lot from the company culture and on the job training, but there was too much corporate structure and restructuring constantly that made it difficult to get clear goals communicated."
good,"I have started working with JC in the month of May 2019. This is good company. Working for sales contract,  sales order,  purchase order and billing creation"
good,"Team management - Good"
good,"If they need more money, they will fire you."
good,"Una compania muy profesional,personal muy enfocado"
good,"Atuei como Auditor de compliance LATAM, com trabalhos no Chile e Mexico."
good,"Most of us are new hires in a new office. Very few of the employees have had official training...so we stumble through our office work."
good,Work life balance is not so good here. Good place to work and you will get a nice technology stack to work with but not a fun place to enjoy your work.
good,"My first manager was awesome. Then she retired. I excelled with her. If you want to get ahead, you have to learn on your own. Management had too many expectations, and they didn't know the job themselves. Other managers were biased and snotty."
good,The turnover rate at Johnson Controls was extremely high due to failed drug tests. The folks could have a minor incident and be drug tested on the spot. Not a lot of folks were clean which is why they failed to keep their job. The pay was low as well but I'm sure after time you could work your way up.
good,"Expecting changes without changing anything, Got tired of hearing about changes and never see it happen. More work out of the same amount of people only benefits the employees that get bonuses from someone else's work. Not training personnel on systems that they work on for the customers. No additional pay for doing a great job each year."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"While our local office is amazing, the corporate environment leaves much to be desired. They are sending so many job functions overseas it is making it extremely difficult to get anything done in a timely manner."
good,"The people are generally nice, but company has not caught up with current professional environments.  No specific training for onboarding directly related to the role of the new hire."
good,"Good job, room for advancement but currently unstable environment. At Johnson Controls you have flexibility in your environment depending on your respective manager."
good,I learned that Johnson Controls is a company undergoing change.  Accountants are driving the day to day business activities and the drive to be more profitable is very strong.  This impacts your daily work in many ways and not always in a positive way for the customer.  I believe it is a good company to work for and in the long run will still be a good company.
good,"My time at the corporate office left me feeling small and insignificant, however I felt that my time at the plants (70%) was well spent, appreciated, and productive."
good,"Good company, great peers and excellent people that work hard, management is average but looking for company's best interest, share services is a great group"
good,Profissionais treinados e capacitados para realizar as funções estabelecidas!
good,"It is all about sales. (Which is good.)"
good,es una empresa donde aprenderas y te desarrollaras de acuerdo a tus capcidades
good,it was an ok job. meet a lot of cool new people. also learned a few skills. the only thing sucked was the assembly side because of the foreman he was something else
good,"Fortunate to obtain position at JCI during 2008-2010 Recession.  Demanding job, but good benefits and fair pay.  Worked approx 50 hrs a week, and more during budget prep."
good,"Business Intelligence Analisi per tutto il mercato Europeo Condizionatori Hitachi. Definizione e misura di Kpi's."
good,"1. Most of the work is based on embedded application development."
good,Great place to work; through merges I need to supplement my income. I will remain employed and would like to work part time outside of the industry I am in to avoid and conflict of interest.
good,"very lovely place for work and learn something new"
good,"I don't recommend to join. "
good,I answer emails on a day to day basis. I post job vacancies online. I do the initial interviews of the new applicants. I inform my managers if I have a pool of candidates for the vacancy in their department.
good,working at Johnson controls there are not many friendly people and almost everyone talks about everyone. this job is messy and not well ran. there are many different people working there.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"not a place for everyone, you have to be open minded to out look on the company. if you show good attitude and knowledge you will get hired on. good compensation for education and training."
good,A typical day as a HVAC technician included managing a preventative maintenance program and repair broken equipment as required. Also use the BAS Metasys to troubleshoot system problems.
good,Incredible level of micromanagement. Too many silos within departments. Good people in most areas but highly political in a lot of respects.  Difficult to develop trust within departments
good,"This is a work environment that is very fast paced and they have a lot of things for you to do there. There are many positions there, and they all are very demanding on you physically."
good,It's a ok place to work really strict about certain things they shouldn't be they mandatory overtime and will get written up if you don't stay buy it's a job
good,"The people working for Johnson Controls are amazing.  Overall a good company with good benefits.   It was just the constant changes that made it stressful,"
good,I had to work with a lot of chemicals and had to be completely cover with a uniform with no skin out. I had to take showers before you leave the building. I have to get skin tested every 3 months.
good,good environment to work and your role will play crucial in the project all the stuff to be maintained by an engineer only should be good at communication and best platform to learn the things
good,"Change into uniform, get with other codrivers about what's going on for the day. Do Pre trip inspection on truck. Do a yard check. Get with other supervisors on what they are going to need."
good,Slack of getting hired on through the company. Sometimes the the manager would be rude. Overall i would be still there if it wasnt for the slow process of getting hired on.
good,a day at johnson controls was pretty simple could be fast paced some days but overall pretty simple .i learned how to be a great inspector and keep my eyes for all things if small.hardest part of the job was just long hours. the most enjoyable was the people.
good,Company vehicle with set territories unlimited income opportunity. Johnson Controls is a company that is growing and has many opportunities for career growth.
good,"I was fortunate to have a fantastic manager while at Johnson Controls.  However, the company encourages a cut throat atmosphere among teams and departments."
good,"There does not appear to be much stability in the IT dept and some of the management are rather un-insightful when it comes to reading new personnel. They also are not very forthright when it comes to letting personnel know what there true status is.  "
good,"JCI is good company to work for and offers a lot of opportunities for growth.  The people are friendly, and the atmosphere is safe and diversified.  My daily duties are listed below:"
good,Ever Changing - due to ongoing acquisitions and restructuring  - generally a company where things move slowly and there is always chnges happening that are unexpected.
good,I was in hands on program which I learn working with HVAC. I promise to be sent to a school to learn about HVAC but program was cancel. I had to learn fast or be let out from the company.
good,While working at Johnson Controls I was able to gain more experience in the desk side support role. The experience was great and the team I worked with was great.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"A lot of changes in recent years; driving very hard to meet the expectations of Wall Street, sometime by compromising ethical standard.Except for cutting cost, not clear what other winning strategies are there."
good,"Johnson Controls is much like other corporate entities, work life balance is not all that great. Same as other companies that like to think this is true."
good,Good company to work for. Field of service that I worked for was terminated. Other fields seem to continue to grow with opportunities  for advancement.
good,Customer complaints that were not followed up at for a long time. There was never a sense of urgency. the PO's had to be approved and confirmed in Mexico and the Invoices from Milwaukee.
good,The management is supportive and I have a flexible work schedule.  I cam work at home on occasion.  The hardest part of the job is the fact that we can't always help our customers without other departments being involved to create the final solution.
good,Worked as a consultant for short time but I learned a great deal and was able to propose improvement in the manufacturing process that resulted in big savings
good,"As management changed, the direction the company was going in changed too. This meant they added people, and then when they changed direction, they had to fire people. There were some degrading managers as well."
good,"Ever heard of the ""buyer beware"" statement? This could also ring true the person(s) appling for this job. The company is actually rather good to work for, but they are constantly under staffed at all positions causing you to have to pull overtime on your days off with little or no time to plan ahead. You work a 2-2-3 rotating 12 hr shift schedule. Lots of opportunities to advance in the company and the money is great if you don't have a life outside of work. Management for the most part will always try to support you and will help you reach your potential in the company. But it is a very stressful job and you are constantly moving on your feet. While I was there I averaged walking 11 miles a day (23,000 steps). The people I worked with were amazing and I made some great friends there. I just needed a job with a more flexible schedule. I do miss the money and people. Again this job can be rewarding if you can deal with the stress that comes with it."
good,"Hardly any engineering assistance."
good,"Empresa com vários benefícios ao funcionário, flexivel, muito boa de trabalhar e super indico para amigos."
good,JCI is very fast paced and there's lots of work to be done. It's a good culture but very busy all the time. There is no rest at JCI it;s work work work work
good,"Johnson Controls, Inc. is an average place to work.  You are required to work many hours. The benefits are average, as well as, the environment.  The turnover rate is high."
good,I never worked at this company long enough to make any judgments against anybody. This company was full of hardworking people Im sure. we worked very hard here at this company the short time I was there.
good,Takes forever to get to a level that they want to hire you in. But the pace and constant rotating leaves you with a never dull moment. You have to keep up with the team and if you don't you're easily picked out. I liked the challenge of the position.
good,I am sure this is a great place to work as I still have friends that still work there. Its just not a field for me. the pay is ok for the position but I felt we should have been paid more
good,Not always enough technicians available to handle workload.  Not always easy to get assistance for clients.  Management staff not always available/accessible.
good,Job can be a little challenging at times but overall good place to work. I learned how to assemble coils. I learned what and how their used. loved my coworkers
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,johnson controls is a safe and clean work place. But the hardest part of the job is working without tools and without training and if you got hurt or you complain you will be fired
good,I really don't have a lot to say about the company it was some nice people I didn't care for the facts that Manager didn't Listen to you before something happen and than it happen. But this was inside of IT not the whole company.
good,"JC was a great learning experience a great pace to work "
good,Beautiful work space in an urban setting with parking downtown in Milwaukee. Forty five minute lunch allows you to work out in the onsite gym or take a walk.

good,"pays the bills "
good,You work hard and fast and you have to get out a quota they will tell to get a move on if you are behind your quota Pay is good and weekly It is supposed to be climate control but it is not
good,"8 Hours per day of scheduling jobs created by customer service, arrange for technicians go on site to repair alarm equipment. "
good,Johnson Controls Provided you with the ability to work everyday without supervision. They provided you with a company vehicle and you were allowed to head directly to your job without going to the office each morning. Laid back management department that allowed you the freedom to balance your work life and personal life.
good,"Lugar tranquilo buen ambiente laboral, poco estresante."
good,"It's a perfectly fine place to work. The pay isn't great, but it's not terrible. It's not overly demanding, and you aren't micromanaged in my department. The company so huge that I can't confirm or deny that is the case everywhere. In general, I enjoy the ~15 people I work with on a daily basis."
good,I took the job thinking that I could work it for a little while. I later realized that I had no interest in this kind of work and I needed to leave.  It would be an ideal place for some people to work just not me.
good,"Fast pace environment, heavy lifting involved, under extreme temperature conditions. Works on incentive, during 12 hour shifts.  Decent health insurance, poor dental insurance."
good,"family ort."
good,It is a very hot environment. Never go home dirty. The pay is decent but not for what is asked. This company could be great if management was betterl.
good,"it was an friendly job to work at very repetitive work, but I like to be able to work in different areas and not in just one spot. Slow paced so it made time go very slow."

good,"I worked alone and it was good.I did my job without supervision. I could have used some help every once and a while, but they never gave me too much on my plate for the day."
good,This position allowed me more learning experience on various machines as well as on the job training.  I enjoyed my time here at Johnson Controls. Had a great supervisor while I was employed at this job.
good,The managers like to keep you down if you were good at your position. They would not help you achieve success. The minority to majority ratio in upper management is not fair at all

Teaching my managers and co-workers about lean and Six Sigma was exciting seeing the results.  Helping to launch this account with a new customer with 390 sites, our team was successful renewing 2+ times. Our management has changed but have been replaced with qualified Leaders. Cons have been work life balance, being on call 24/7. Which have worked on reducing the account Hourly and staff on-call. But I did enjoy working as an Operation Manager on this account.

The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to provide quality support  and helping other technicians out in the field."

good,Most of my projects were for the company's new headquarters and therefore there was high visibility in a workplace culture that was very fast paced and therefore stressful

good,Office management was somewhat very snobby and showed no interest or engagement with other employees on the floor.  They pretty much treated others bad
good,Unfortunately JCI was the typical growing company.  Always restructuring and eliminating people as it grew.  The management that I was under from Milwaukee was EXCELLENT to work with.
good,"The pay at Johnson Control was good. I enjoyed working their, but it was not the right fit for me. Working in a lead environment was not the job I wanted as a permanent thing."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,Productive company to work for.  Taught communication skills in a fast paced environment.  The commodity that I had was not much for purchasing.  Boss was flexible with work hours.  Hardest part is keeping up.

good,"Work is repetitive"
good,I had communication and trust issues with every contractor I worked for. the work was never all that hard. I was never placed in the position for my training. Every federal contractor I worked for had that problem.

good,Enjoyed the consistency of my work there. Hot environment though. The pay even through the temp agency was good then. Wasn't there long enough to get hired on.
good,Decent job with great benefits I have worked here for 5 years and it's been a good job but I need more advancement and I'm going to be moving out of state
good,Working the assembly line is very fast paced but good work an money. Management was not respectful though if you like working johnson controls is a good place of employment.
good,From going to a small company to a corporation is quite a difference. You will find a group of friends with the same values and life structures within a large diversity.
good,"It is a busy environment which require focus and dedication from an individual."
good,"When I worked for them they were into the industrial maintenance and operations, but about 3 yrs ago they were bought out and are no longer into that part of the industry"

good,"i did not know this facilities hired convicted felons, addict. This was a good company to work for making parts for ford motor and Toyota. i met some interested and unique people, the company over all was fun and exciting to work for and with"
good,A place where you can survive less by skills more on PR. Salary & all are ok but work culture is not so good. too much of micro management in every work and you also need to be ready for hire & fire policy.
good,"You have to be ready to work,not laid back which is good,easy work but hot building,best thing to do there is drive forklift,supervisor very nice guy but nice people"
good,"Johnson Controls was a fine employer, however the nature of my employment was that of a maintenance service contract. When the contract expired, those of us that weren't hired by the new contractor were shown no loyalty by Johnson Controls. They didn't retain us for other contracts, the terminated us."
good,making sure to send out quality parts. I have learned how to work great as a team. your union is there to help you when needed . You don t always have a good day but you try to make the best of what you can.

good,Working at Johnson Controls was hard because i enjoyed the work but you also need the right face or new someone well to progress yourself. I've learnt a vast amount about the automotive business and developed certain skills to help me on my future endeavors. I've always said its the people that make Johnson Controls. the MTMs at Johnson controls are the ones making the company work now. but due to mistakes in quality and management the company pushes for production numbers and will lead to the company eventually closing.
good,"Typical day at my is the co workers are very pleasent and my job is fairly easily some days. "
good,Good company - large room for advancement.  Good benefits.  not fully secure as many jobs are currently being sent to other countries
good,"The work load was greater than the compensation. Expectations and achievements were not acknowledged by the senior management. It was a great place to learn to juggle multiple duties at one time.  The management did not recognize the importance of ""real life"" situations that occur outside the work place."
good,"One of the main things i have learned is how to utilize my time while onsite. working alone and remotely requires you to develop a system of your own in order to stay productive and not get overwhelmed under heavy work loads."
good,"I was working 10-12 hour days and with 2 little ones at home I decided I needed to be home for them more.  Looking for something with 40 hours with max OT of 5 hours.  I learned a lot in my 15 years with the company.  In 2005 management changed and things became crazy with lack of office workers which lead to all the OT.  The hardest part of my job was leaving for work while my little ones were sleeping and coming home with them already in bed.  At the office the hardest part was the lack of consistent managerial decisions.  They would have us pull up/create reports for financial reasons and while working diligently to gather information that became less important, they would switch gears on us and we'd have to start over on pulling up/creating different type's of reports.  That was aside from running our teams, creating our schedules and communicating with our customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers/friends I made over my 15 years with the company.  Us working together to try to deliver management request."
good,"Middle management is in complete chaos.  In my year and a half of employment, they company reorganized twice.  Middle management consists primarily of people that are ""just passing through"" or were promoted beyond their level of competence."

good,"Hard to advance, but good raises and benefits.  Management acts like they are listening but in all reality they are not.  Felt betrayed many times.  Great HR department though."
good,"Although the company is very large and offers a lot of great opportunities, there is not much in the way of personal training and you are left to figure things out on your own. not really at all what I was expecting, as well they sell to contractors as well as bid against them and I don't feel that is what I truly want to be part of"
good,Nice place to work willing to teach you the skills needed to be productive. Long work hours with plenty of overtime. A typical work day lasted until production was complete which made some days run short but most ran long. The hardest part of the job for me was managing work at night with school during the day.
good,The Drive was too far. The work wasn't consistant.I often was let out early. I learned I did not like welding. My coworkers were friendly. The hardest part was constantly cleaning sensors.
good,The daily work routine is anything but routine.  Each day brings a new experience.  Management encourages you to bring your own ideas to the table and co-workers keep things fun and inviting keeping the team atmosphere.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,Good company to work for and a lot of friendly people work there. It was easy to learn but it was a lot of repetition.
good,"I would get my filters and work orders for the day, place all the materials in my truck and go the appropritate sites. I learned AC basics and assisted with some AC machanics. Management is overall friendly but strict. Co-workers are rarely together unless placed in a team for a work order that requires more than one person. Hardest part of the job would be, having such a slow pace. Most enjoyable part is being able to work alone most of the time."
good,"Job Profile : Challenging work profile, I would always love to take challenges, which Johnson Controls gave me by promoting me to next level."
good,"My typical day started at 6:00 and finished at 14:30. My role was drive a forklift and load and unload material from truck and move material to manufactury. My co-workers was fine we haven't any problems each other, we help each other when was necessary."

good,Johnson Controls is an automotive workplace with assembly lines. Build seats and doors for our customers.

Management need more improvement with their leadership and communication on order to build quality parts.
good,"Fun days at a job,keeps you busy,learned a lot about the process of making recliner seats,coworkers friendly,hardest thing to adjust to was not knowing when you get out of work.Most enjoyable thing is working and people being helpful if you needed anything."

good,I like the job but I did not like the treatment and how fast they did not have job security
good,Communicating with customers to provide for their HVAC needs; invoicing customers for service calls; reconcile AR issues; processing maintenance renewals.  Have learned a lot about the service industry.  Work with other agents and service mechanics. Scheduling service call is the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part is the variety of duties - no room for boredom.

good,"Union job, disappointed with union services and benefits. Texas right to work law has hampered union tremendously"

good,"My typical day would be standing in the same spot with a heat gun in one hand and a ""finessing tool ""in the other,using these implements I would heat the leather on the seats an ""finesse"" sub standard items to an acceptable standard."
good,I gained a lot of experience from the base company where I started the company had been purchased by York then by Johnson Controls.  In that transition I saw less advancement oppurtunities and less diversity than I desired to succeed with my experience that I had obtained over the years accumulative for the same group of people (essentially the same company) over a period of 16 years.  I love to learn and my outgoing hands on style created a very solid basis for many of the departments I worked in and exceptional customer service for both internal and external customer's.  I was continually working towards improving or correcting issue's that we were facing in the normal  to critical blocks that appear in a professional environment.  If it isn't efficient or purpose driven activity the process needs changed or improved.
good,"Primary duties were to inspect all units performing standardize tests. Had to read schematics and made sure connections were in accordance with the schematics. After all test were done on a unit and passed, the unit could go through to the next area of manufacture. If not, it had to go out of line."
good,"I got on well with everyone in my team. The machines were different to other machines I have worked on, the fabric the we used was a lot thicker and plastic had to be sewn on to it. We worked shifts, days and nights which I didn't take to very well but I enjoyed the different work."
good,I would work on a marriage line assembling and checking car seat carriages
good,"Good company, people and processes.  Very solid approach to business."
good,"on a day to day basis things can change at the last minute, from going on a planed maint/visit, to a breakdown call 3hrs away which can be challenging and rewarding when it all goes right, working with experience engineers who have shared their knowledge. management you have to take that on a day to day basis if things are going well so are they, work mates would have to say some of the best you could work with and better when we get together for a drink. hardest part of the job on call at week ends and the most enjoyable when your not and having a pig of a fault and getting the plant all up and running again and the customer is happy.

good,"The co-workers was pleasure to work with, everyone work together. My job as a sewing machine operator, was to assemble pieces of material and sew together to make seat covers for different GMC motor vehicles. The hardest part of the job was adjusting the sewing machine to the different type of material."
good,Johnson Controls heeft mij de kans gegeven om veel te leren en door te groeien tot financieel controller. Open omgeving waar geen strikte regels gelden en waar iederen de kans krijgt om zijn mening te geven.

good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"Great company to work for. Would have loved to retire from the company. This company taught me alot about the HVAC systems. When I first started the company all I knew about HVAC is that we provided service to different companies. Now I can tell you the different type of units examples AHU, RTU, Chillers and also the functions of the units."
good,"It was my first taste of the ""assembly line"" factory setting. It was a good learning experience, I was used to hard work but the ability to work through repetition and condition myself was something I was able to take away from it."

good,As I am works in all floor maintanence and to support the electrical supply to get at 24 hours in that site.
good,friendly and cooperative employess. hardest part of my job is balancing my personal and work life.
good,"Work is slow, not getting 40 hr week. Lack of work for all employees each week."
good,It is a very fast paced and high pressure environment that is growing fast. We work 7 days a week with some long hours. It seems to be very hard to advance in the company though.
good,"Productive and learning different tools at the workplace. I enjoy team leads honest opinions, easy to talk to. co-workers are a pleasure to be around. The most enjoyable part of the job.talking to different customer on different issues."
good,My typical day at work is mandartory overtime. Management is fair my co-workers great punch of people to work with . Hardest partof my job is workin 3rd shift.Enjoyable part of my job when we make our prodution for the month they rewards us with a apprecation dinner
good,Middle management creates a very unsavory environment with unrealistic expectations and makes you feel miserable for doing your best.
good,Good People. No organization. No preffesional growth. Lots of overtime.
good,I enjoy working for Johnson Controls because it is fast paced and the employees are very helpful and a joy to work with.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,Our work starts at 6 15 am and ends between 3 and 6 pm. I learned how to be very productive and good at what I do. I also could take on any task that I was asked to do. The management was up and down while I was there. Toward the end the management go where they would wait to the last min to tell us some things that were important to us. The hardest part of day is when the production line slows all the way down and makes the day longer for no reason. The most enjoyable of part of my day is when everyone is working together and being very productive.
good,"very nice co workers, particularily 3rd shift, the management in certain is not great because of the uncertainity you have, there are always changes within your schedule, the most enjoyable part is getting off of work on time and everything runs smooth according to production, The hardest part is picking up the slack from all the other shifts"
good,"I like to be kept busy, learn new tasks and have new challenges and projects."
good,"Very Quick To Adapt To, Quick To Make Friends & Get Along With Everyone...Comfortable Work Enviroment"
good,"A day's work was mobility from start to finish,"
good,Is a really good company but you must give it all you got. No time for family or friends. Good bonuses and great benefits. Only set back is sales reps who always leave loose ends or they undersold projects. Later they expect management to come up with a change order for something that's was suppose to be in scope of work.
good,Johnson Controls is a huge company with many opportunities to look for. It's really on top of the employees wellness...
good,"Johnson Controls pays competitive salaries, however job security is questionable.  The company goes through multiple restructurings of the various organization across Europe frequently. I have witnessed many colleagues come and go. This implies an employee is subject to many changes of line managers, i.e. the hiring manager you interview with may not be your manager in 6-8 months. This negatively impacts career progression within the organization. In general, your happiness at the company is strongly correlated to your line manager and the line of business you find yourself in. There are inspiring leaders in the company and there are old fashioned managers as in many global corporations. I had the luck that the majority of my bosses were great and motivating leaders, unfortunately they are no longer at Johnson Controls."
good,"Johnson Controls (Clarios) ofrece estabilidad laboral, sin embargo, las jornadas de trabajo son extenuantes, es necesario trabajar sábado y domingos al igual que días feriados. difícilmente se puede balancear la vida personal con la laboral."
good,"Most supervisor and managers dont execute problem solving skills, always passing the problems to someone else instead of actually trying to solve it. They always want to know whats wrong and how long will something take, thats it."
good,"Company itself not bad, management could use some tweaking. Work environment not bad either, always room for improvement. Promotions and/or advancements seem hard to come by, even for the most experienced employees."
good,"Worthwhile experience and you are updated with latest industry technologies. Trainings are provided whenever necessary. It is a company with high level of ethical standard. Work is challenging as you will be involved in all aspects of the works. However, management structure changes very often and career promotion is less likely to be given."
good,A workplace with good workalike balance with fair learning opportunities. This company has deep domain expertise which keeps it number one in its segment
good,"aprendí muchas cosas y la verdad no batallaba con la apariencia era solo llegar y trabajar, el pago por semana esta bien ya que otras empresas pagan por quincena y eso es lo peor."
good,es buena empresa tiene buena dirección y trazada los objetivos de las metas hacia donde quiere llegar en un futuro.

good,"Johnson Controls in Murfreesboro, TN. is a supplier of seating for Nissan of North America located in nearby Smyrna, TN. It was fast, hard, intense work but paid well as long as you remained healthy."
good,it was a good company for me good chances to grow in the company.very clean place to work a lot of overtime including Saturday .i really like this job very much
good,I learned at my time with this company that I can make a difference in how I spend my time. Adient/JCI is a just-in-time facility. My job performance directly affected the company. I  always worked harder to help the company.
good,Too many hours and not enough people. The management team mainly cares about meeting deadlines at any cost including working their employees into the ground.
good,"The environment changed immensely after the merger with Tyco.  Johnson Controls focused more on their employees and since the merger with Tyco, the company seems to be more Tyco centric."
good,"Las prestaciones superan a las de ley y sus empleados tienen muchos beneficios, asi como descuentos en las diferentes marcas que se manejan. "
good,With them thinking about selling the company there was talk of them taking out pension away so that is why i retired from their. Alot of changes were in the plans for the company
good,"Time management is a definite need."
good,Good place to work and management was really involved in day  to day activities.  The down sided was I was responsible for site maintenance and Logistics and it created a conflict that made it difficult to perform both jobs effectively.
good,My time at johnson controls I have always had a good pay with good benefits. The hours are shift works and can be hard but with the job security I am now being made redundant
good,"constant changes from upper management to meet bottom line.  be ready for operation consolidations, merges or acquisitions. lots of learning and lots of demand."
good,"worked a lot of 12 days and weekends and holidays, mandatory,for production or installation.mostly worked on production machinery during the week, weekends and holidays was usually new installs."
good,"Good company, but too many organizational changes and realignment. Position was always changing, lay-offs, reduction in force, and uncertainty about future direction."
good,good no issues working there but some changes after brought by new company. Not bad place to work. I have worked there almost all my adult life. I loved the opportunity.
good,"I loved working for Johnson Controls, I loved the people I worked with- great group of people in every department.  However people came through left and right, and while I was told my position was likely a long term permanent position, my position was dissolved w/in 5 months.  They let their work load become too much, hired me - I got it down to a manageable level and then was let go.  It was not a great experience, it would have been different had they let me know right away that it was a temporary assignment.  However, that was not the case- they made me believe it would be a temp-to-hire situation, and I don't believe that was ever the intention when hiring me on."
good,"Empresa muito boa para se trabalhar,sempre atenta com os empregados, muitos benefícios e ambiente agradável."
good,Great work life balance however they really need to change compensation structure. Every security company pays almost double to do the same job. my office lost a lot of good people to competition due to salary issues
good,"Oportunidad de emprender ideas nuevas en el departamento de mejora continua, sin embargo el ambiente laboral entre administrativos no suele ser cooperativo. Sueldos debajo de lo normal."
good,La empresa le da mas importancia y valor a sus necesidades que al personal que labora
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"Johnson Controls is a fast paced manufacturing environment. I have worked there as a temporary worker several times. I refused permanent employment because I did not want to be ""bumped"" to a shift other than 1st."
good,Was a very stressfull job due to on and off assembly lines not having parts. other than that it was not a bad place to work. they have a amazing amount of employee turnover
good,Aftermarket business is a service-oriented business predicated on timely support to the customer. The efficient tools at the organization were extremely beneficial in driving the business.
good,Working at JCI was fast paced and you needed to be able to handle several task or projects at once.  Middle management was very supportive.  The office staff area was always clean and a good work culture.  The production floor was sometimes dirty and unsafe.  One department was very dirty and extra safety measures had to be implemented.
good,"I was assigned to the Major Projects Division, in this division the largest projects in the company are managed. The toughest project was the UN conference building."
good,as a contractor we did what the army personnel did not do if they kick a hole in the wall 2 hours later it was repair and painted if the  pipes froze up we un froze then  this a learning task and enjoyable.
good,"Fast pase, standing long hours. No communication, hard to get advancements. Staff is rude at times. Point system is trash. It takes 60 days to drop a point if you get one. The month you get a point doesn't count. It starts the following month. 30 days attendance free."
good,"It was assembly line based work, so you had to be able to adapt to a very fast paced environment. Sometimes it could be quite stressful, due to poor management."
good,"se dan recorridos en planta, se checa que el personal porte su uniforme y EPP se observan durante el recorrido algunos factores que podrian ser causas de riesgos se llenan unos formatos de seguridad e higiene se realiza el trabajo de enfermeria industrial del diario"
good,"Overall a good place to work.  Be prepared to work overtime as a supervisor.  If you want extra income, you are compensated for the overtime on weekends."
good,"A typical day of running a small assembly line putting together seats in cars for different automobile companies. The hardest part of the job was nothing. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people,getting paid every weekly."
good,Company was great to work for. Excellent benefits including low cost insurance and PTO but management at the Tampa office left a lot to be desired. Worked as a Fire/security Tech 1 but manager wanted to micro-manage but had only HVAC experience.
good,Everyone worked through a temp service so they were let go at any given time. Sometimes a production line would move to a different factory resulting in the people on that line to get laid off. That is what happened in my case.
good,Johnson Controls is a good job with top pay. The work hours where hard when you have children its hard to work a 12 hour over night and be able to take care of kids.
good,great environment to work in some of the machinery needs to be upgraded not enough spare parts on hand wrong people in positions without knowledge of there work being performed
good,"Excellent project management challenges for all professionals."
good,The hours were good and consistent and the pay was good. Everyone had a pretty good attitude and everybody was a team player. The management was solid and knew what they were doing.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"Dia de trabalho dinâmico, as vezes situações corriqueiras, porém com pelo menos um dia da semana de distúrbios; normal como qualquer empresa."
good,"Great working environment, I have gathered many skills over the years being with the company and enjoyed my time working here. very good team work within the company."
good,Great company but work is demanding and you're never done. It always a fire to put out so there is no work life balance. benefits ar great and the people are smart. I learned a lot.
good,"Meu trabalho de muita pressão e satisfação, foi adquirindo muito conhecimento usando a prática e problemas do dia a dia, a direção deixava muito a desejar devido a troca constante de comando e alteração do centro de custo."
good,sorry could only rate  a 3 star as not direct employee have not worked for Johnson's controls direct only through an agency .Aktrion. got messed about with shifts and hours told to stay on shift then a text to cancel shifts
good,"Technically, I worked for Tyco Integrated Security before Johnson Controls took over, so things may end up being different but my experience at Tyco was a mixed bag.  The jobs at the call center themselves are fine, just fine as a job.  Nothing truly fulfilling or anything that will make you love what you do everyday at work, but nothing terrible or really anything to complain about either.  The worst part of the job were dealing with some of the co-workers and middle management."
good,Johnson Controls is an international company with good employee benefits and has diverse culture among the employees and clients. Through all the challenges I faced it has been a good experience.
good,Okay place to work. Supervisors can be selective on enforcing rules and regulations. Opportunities to advance to other areas or positions by bidding on them.
good,A typical day was trying but also learned something new everyday. Management was sometimes one sided but would help if needed but the co-workers was a great group of people to work with. My hardest part about the job was monday's if was a long day most of the time had to stay over to complete the payroll close.
good,"good place to work, hours of work rotates but remains steady no shift changes, either two days on and three days off or three days on and two days off, exceptional vacation package, average benefit package."
good,"Sentiment appartenance société"
good,"The organization is currently going through a period of change that is absolutely necessary to bring it into the modern era. The culture is something that is changing as well with many people moving from positions that are not the right fit for them. There is a need to follow more strict processes. There is unfortunately issues with change management and a lack of accountability."
good,Most people were friendly but the facilities were lacking.  Part of our offices were in the main building but some of the new hires were located in trailers that were drafty in winter.  Each time someone opened the door the cold air would blow through.  Too many people in too small a space.  If someone caught a cold you could count on catching it yourself.  I enjoyed the work and people I worked with.
good,Johnson control is a nice place to work if your willing to learn. At jci your learning how to build front row seats an the back seats also like I said it not hard work you just using  a lot of your hands and by using your hands a lot you using muscles in your hand that you never used before .the seats or the Kia cars you see riding around the US today.

good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,human resources is lacking in telling employees about available medical leave. Also non productive workers who know human resources are not fired
good,"Its a pure 9 to 5 basis Job, where all work activities needs to finished with the given time frame (Monthly/Yearly). "
good,"Days were variable depending on priority and availability of parts required for the assembly line. "
good,Would just be better if i wasn't a sub contractor so that i would have better benefits and job security. Better health insurance and payed holidays would be nice. An being a hired in instead of sub contract would be a bonus also.
good,"una empresa con disciplina , enfocada a el servicio a el cliente y el cuidado de los empleados, desarrollo de trabajadores, inicio de la creacion de equipos autodirigidos."
good,en cuestion de prestaciones muy bien pero la empresa no apoya a sus trabajadores ya que se enfocan a ayudar a conocidos
good,"Uma empresa em crescimento e que esta buscando melhorias, ainda tem que melhorar em muitos aspectos, mais um bom sinal é que esta buscando se modernizar e melhorar o ambiente de trabalho e os processos."
good,"Good work life balance, pays pretty good. But very bad overall company strategy and management decisions. Conservative midwest company."
good,Fair place to work. Offers benefits and a sustainable culture to work within.  Supportive management.  Big company with lots of growth and opportunity.
good,"- Productivity is one of main objective of Johnson Controls Pte Ltd."
good,Johnson controls was a good place to work the enviroment was friendly and my co workers were good to work with. I could either work very early or very late my schedule was not the same every week.  I would travel to the customers site and either by myself or with co workers either test or install fire and security systems.
good,Working on a assembly line putting together dashboards for 8 to 12 hour shifts. It is a nice place to work if you need to stay with income

good,"I was hired for a newly created position with JCI at JDSU Bloomfield, CT in November of 2014 and let go March 13, 2015 due to non approval of the budget to support my position."
good,"Every day was a chance to provide the best customer service to our customers.  We provided phone support to our branch customers, and never missed an opportunity to help our internal customers and coworkers.  Because our group was so large, sometimes the different personalities interfered with the mission of finding the best and most efficient answers to problems.  Those this rose up occasionally, the people I worked with were considered my friends, and I would do anything to help them out.  I found a lot of satisfaction being a ""go to"" person for questions."
good,"Trabalhei durante dez anos nessa empresa, aprendi muito, tanto profissionalmente como pessoalmente."
good,"fast paced always moving to keep up with assembly line."
good,"The company overall is solid, but there are many inefficiencies and poor management choices that have JCI lagging behind the competition. Management is hit or miss. People are put into manager roles that should not be managers. Things are slow moving. Approvals take forever. The employees are very friendly and hard working."
good,"Unlike smaller companies, these large corporate companies are only interested in profits."

A lot of the co-workers are nice and cool. The hardest part of the job is the heat in the summer do to the machines throwing out a lot heat to weld the parts. The most enjoyable part of the day is the work atmosphere."
good,Working with a team of highly energetic and enthusiastic people.
good,"Good job for area, worked for company for almost  8 years and never really knew the company I worked for. Not really a stressful job for the most part, good company mission, great diversity policy, average compensation, weak insurance choices for large company, I brought all my skills to this job and was not trained in any new areas except monthly safety training and a 1 hour software application class"
good,"My department was taken over by this company, it was a rocky change and with in 4 months the contact was ended. I do not blame Johnson Controls of the failure but I did feel put into a system and the personalization was taken out of my work place."
good,"Johnson Controls helps OEM customers enhance the user experience with instrument panels, floor consoles, door panels, headliners & overhead systems, and overhead consoles."
good,do not think we get paid fairly for the type of the job we do. We had $4 pay cut couple years back never got them back till today even though that the company is making a profit
good,"Liked it, but didn't have a child at the time and could work all the overtime they needed me too."

good,"Atypical day at work: Multi task with billing, contracts, customer calls."
good,"A typical day consist of collecting and collaborating on generating customer reports. Managing customer requests to reduce space, to meet new Corp. directives for space allocations. Identifying opportunities for affecting efficiency in work flow procedures and reduce costs. Dealing with a customer who is never satisfied with what you produce or the value you add. The most difficult part of my position is having to let people go due to down sizing and cost savings. I really enjoy the people aspect of my position and the strategic planning."

good,Interesting job in which a high rise building operates.Operate preventive maintenance and emergency situtations
good,we can improve communication skills
good,It is a great company but the local managers are hard to work for in the Fire/Security Industry in California.
good,"As the Customer Service manager I would first conduct a morning meeting to ensure all my employees had the necessary tools to complete there jobs for the day. I would read and answer all emails to ensure our customers had the parts needed from us. Take care of billing and any issues that may accure thoughout the day,"
good,Het bedrijf vindt dat de doorgroei mogelijkheden een belangrijk item is voor de organisatie.
good,"Strong company values, with ethics and safety at height of company policy. Good benefits and investment plans. Work varies with demand. If market becomes slow, there is no such thing as job security. The burden to advance is placed on the employee. Online training is available. A degree is required to move past a basic level."
good,"hard fast pace work, learned how to get along with different types of people, management wasn't the best, all good people to work with, best part of the job is the long lunch."
good,This is a good place to work. However all sites and personel are different. It is almost impossible to review an entire corporation based on one site and certain individuals. From where I sit I would recommend what I do to someone looking for a decent place to work.
good,Società con un grande potenziale umano e professionale purtroppo appartenente ad un gruppo multinazionale che recentemente ha scelto di non investire più in Italia.
good,Johnson Controls was a good job. Depending on who your working with. I go to work to do my job and try to help others when in need of my help. I make sure my work is done on time and that it's done right.
good,Ok. As long as you are working with the right manager. Sometimes it is demanding. Some processess are good and some require enhancements.  If you are guided properly you can do really well here.
good,The work itself was fine. The management definitely made work a lot more difficult than necessary. Hopefully they change the environment to sustain employees.
good,Fairly easy work with demanding expectations. Work load is light with a high volume of calls. Call center position with little flexibility and room for growth.
good,The job itself was something I highly enjoyed. Working with car batteries was right in my alley in terms of past education I had before going into it. It was just a shame that I was never given a chance to go past being a temporary employee; the people there were not welcoming on the idea of putting on new hires so readily.
good,"Good company, good work life balanced. Average benefits for company their size. Excellent 401 K plan with a retirement benefit. Liberal PTO policy 3 weeks to start"
good,The Hvac side of Johnson is stressful and long hours but it can be rewarding.  It was great place to learn and grow in this industry but it as hard to build a  strong dealer base with out having all the ancillary products.
good,".drive so much to pick orders."
good,I think Johnson Controls has become one of the best companies to work for in the country after their acquiring Simplex. Their Management has changed for the better.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,Adaptable environment for people with little to no experience in production and easily acquire skills needed to improve and progress while on the job.
good,Job is great but people will stab you in the back and there's very little backup for those who prove innocence because management just doesn't want to deal with it.
good,"Competitive at times, other times boring, no mobility, don't like working third shift but paid the most per hour. Training did not match being actually on floor, quite a few of what we should know, we don't know. Some simple, some complex."
good,My manager and coworkers work together as a team.  I am learning new things all the time.  Fast pace and enjoyable.  I am treated as a regular employee even though I am a contingent worker.  I would love to stay on perminently.
good,My experience working here was very fun and relaxing. My team members were very helpful to others if it was needed and they also let us listen to music as we worked
good,"it was a short term job as a temp employee.I worked there for 88 days.I was hoping to be hired in ,but was let go ..its part of how temp services are set up."

good,Johnson Controls is in the cut-throat industry of the automotive battery industry. Great advancement opportunities are available. Up to date on technology.
good,"Customer interaction.and paperwork"
good,Johnson Controls is a great company to work for. The problem is upper management does not know how to lead or motivate their employees to want to keep working there.
good,"management does very little to assist field techs when issues arise, but yet demand immediate response from us when they drop the ball on their end and problems arise. fair compensation, co-workers are easy to get along with. solid job security."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"Lots of nice people in the office here, mostly mid- to late-career folks that have no plans to leave. The office culture is not fast paced, which can be both a good thing and a bad thing: if you're settled in the area and plan to be around a while, it could be a great fit for you. Corporate JCI seems intent on making things ever more difficult for Frick, the industrial refrigeration division in Waynesboro."
good,"Entreprise avec beaucoup de produits chimiques, les cadences de travail sont élevés et les pauses ne sont pas collectives mais par roulement."
good,"great team player, and positive attitude. able to handle multiple projects, help with out having to be asked by my supervisor. I also enjoy utilize my time according"
good,It could be worse. The management is a mess I do not always know what I should be doing. Everything that goes wrong is my fault with my machines. Machine are not maniced like they should and never work right ever. I have one and a half hours to two hours downtime every day.
good,"Was able to work from home 2-3 days a week.  Trusted salaried employees.  Work environment was set up for collaborative processes, however my position was more operational and the open concept was a distraction"
good,"A JCI foi uma lição de vida, tive a oportunidade de aprender, desenvolver-me progredir como profissional."
good,"The work is challenging and most of the equipment doesn't work, but the pay is very competitive and fair. It's very easy to schedule things around your time being you only work 6 months out of the year."
good,"Processing Purchase Orders. Preparing Price Quotes. Preparing Daily Reports.  Customer Service.  "
good,I enjoyed the stability of the company.  The work was consistent.  It was good to work for an organization with defined process and procedures for each role.
good,Some of the work was on a line and other parts were on your own.  Had to bid on jobs for advancement.  Business closed it doors so it is no longer in Goshen.
good,"Some quality people and some that aren't qualified but are members of a ""good ole boys"" network.  Senior members of the management team have described some peers as ""unconsciously incompetent"".  I had some great superiors and and I had some that were absolutely not qualified for their roles.  Gender and choice of college were often given more weight than competence."
good,A typical day at johnson controls is very challenging.  I worked in a very complex plant that make changes daily. Never a bored day on the job.  Always improvements to be made.
good,Had to leave due to a bad divorce that I went through.  Great team.  Good integrity.  Long working hours but worth it.  HSE is the best in EL I think.
good,"It is very hot in the summer"
good,"Great company overall. Need to get out of their own way.  Need to keep people and cross train to cross funtional roles NOT LAY OFF. "
good,Ran all facets of service business...included sales and operations with complete responsibility of the P&L statement. Achieved all goals for 4 years including customer satisfaction
good,Very fast pace work environment with high standards.  Company cares about it's employee's.  Work loads can be heavy.  Overall good company to work for.

good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,As a contractor this job seemed typical with any other large corporation. Executive management was not trustworthy. A lot of people lost their jobs at the drop of a dime because the company moved many parts to another country.

good,"Buena empresa con buen equipo de trabajo buena cafetería .turnos de lunes a viernes .bastante tiempo extra."
good,"This job is demanding even for young. strong people, It was hard for me as a older female.  We put together back seats completely.  They would really push people and wanted to have more jobs completed on the line by one person in the same amount of time it would take 2 to 3 people.  I would hog ring for 3 hours in a role. also pull apostasy over seats very tightly on a table that was to high for my height.  If you got hurt and they knew it, they would find a way fire you."
good,"Empresa com ótimos benefícios e salário acima da concorrência."
good,I have a good working experience with mebco damam saudi. I became a better employee and worker since i work there. I gained so much expertise on the job assigned to me. With this i can say tha this will be a great weapon i can bring to the next company i will work with.
good,Entreprise en constante évolution à l'écoute de ses employés.
good,"troubleshooting of equipment, testing on UPS and generation.performs preventive and corrective maintenance . monitor different system for the good going of our operation. performs infrared test of electrical system. manage our daily ongoing service call."
good,"At the time of employment with the company, they were contracted under a food union instead of a automotive union that should have been covering their employees. Unfortunately, when it was time to fight for job security none existed."
good,along with the stability of the workplace I was trained on other machines and worked around some very professional co-workers. The hardest part was working night shift up to 60+ days at a time. the most enjoyable time was when I was on vacation
good,"Great Company, Great Benefits, great staff. Unfortunately lost to much business as a branch office and had to lay off several individuals."
good,"Johnson Controls is a global diversified technology and industrial leader serving customers in more than 150 countries. Our 130,000 employees create quality products, services and solutions to optimize energy and operational efficiencies of buildings; lead-acid automotive batteries and advanced batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles; and seating components and systems for automobiles."
good,Assignment is a continuing Education in regard to the environment and the contractual content. Challenging and Rewarding at the same time.
good,"johnson controls has its ups and downs, overall its a good place to work, I have learned differnt things through out the factory and everything anyone can do if they are willing to work. managment isnt very good to me because, it seems like the employees dosent have in impact on to much of anything. and the coworkers are ok if your are hired in, other wise certain people will try to take advantage of you instead of helping you become better."
good,It's a learning experience. But they have very good trainers. Depending what management has you doing by default can vary the experience; each job has its difficulty. Just pay attention to have quality with speed and all will be well.

good,"Uma Boa empresa para se trabalhar, com beneficios,, empresa que preza muito a etica."
good,Company is selling the Electronics division. Testing components and working with a variety of people. Most technicians came from factory jobs in the past.
good,"Many levels of upper management, sometimes telling you to do things different ways. They are all about the numbers and making stock holders happy. I hear more customer complaints about how jobs are performed or various aspects of the general terms of contracts. Sometimes its hard to do business with a company so large and in turn, its hard to work for a company so large."
good,"Management changes often.  Great pay, but unrealistic goals unless you are forward thinking and planning.  Very aggressive and very little limits on competition and pricing.  Upper management does not care about frontline troops and customers."
good,I work at a satellite office so I do not get a lot of coworker interaction. I travel about 40% of the time. I am able to work from home.
good,Worked with Johnson through their Co-Op program. Spent a lot of time on jobsites programming and troubleshooting controllers. Learned a lot about controls and automation from the technical employees was working with. The techs were very knowledgeable in their fields. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to change job sites every now and again so not in the same place all the time.

good,"Fast paced, demanding, stressful, difficulties with red tape policies.  Strong emphasis on flexibility required as well as daily financial analysis and reviews."
good,"My role in this company was never underlined or recognized officially. On my feet for 12 hours a day, or driving a forklift, I would continuously assist those in need to maintain productivity throughout the department. The management was very back and forth with the enforcement of their own policies. I worked alongside supervisors and group leads to innovate new ideas and improvements, but nothing ever seemed to change. The hardest part of my job was the physical toll, losing nearly 40 pounds in a year, and the most enjoyable part was working alongside a common-goaled team of differently skilled workers, allowing me to learn more about different positions."
good,"Otima empresa para se trabalhar, segmento automotivo,muito dinamico."
good,empresa de grande porte. muito boa com os salários e benefícios
good,Good company to work . If you can navigate daily work . There can be bureaucracy. Also depends on department. They will give enough time to prove you. But certain departments like sales are difficult
good,would get my work from a general dispatcher always had enough to keep me busy had overtime so there was extra money and the people in the school were easy to work with
good,"A typical day at work consists of running reports for financials, billing and incoming jobs. I learned alot about building automation and construction.  The workplace culture was high energy and stressful.  The hardest part of the job was balancing the workload.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers."
good,"Since the company went to headquarters in Cork Ireland, they have not really figured out the role for those working on Federal projects.  We have to be separate, but still there is no definition, and they still have not gotten their house in order."
good,"Since the recent merger/take over of Tyco Int. into the Johnson Controls world, both companies appear to still be finding their balance. As a result, stability is not as good as one would expect."
good,"Over all the culture was good but there was too much turnover with employees and mostly temporary employees. A typical work day included a 8-9 hour day, a lot of standing, and repetitive work."
good,I enjoyed working there. The people I worked were very warm and helpful. If in it best to stay in. You are trained well and often pushed to move pass the position you applied for.
good,"working with face mask on, due to lead in the air for eight hours everyday, then having to shower after each shift, The people was good to work with. Excellent lunch area."
good,"There are a lot of changes going on.  While change isn't a bad thing, there seems to be times when upper management doesn't know what is going on.  The benefits are great and the compensation is very competitive.  The main focus seems to be condensing the schedule without realizing how everything is affected."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"Days at work are always very busy and the hours pass really fast, there is a mix of working on Microsoft office and talking to different areas to deliver commercial projects."
good,I love the people.  The work is challenging and the company has recently merged with Tyco and is undergoing major changes.  Possibly a great time to forge your future here.
good,"I would recommending work at Johnson Controls if your trying to receive good money at a fast rate.  The job hours are long, but if you don't have a family and are just looking to put a lot of money into your pocket and fast.  Johnson Controls is the way to go."
good,Working in a Company like this is one of the best company I ever work with. Safety is always number one priority. Management and the job is FAIR. Improvement  always occur every time I step in the floor.
good,"In some corporations, 1 employee may be recognized by many and/or none - With a large company, it is easy to slip through the cracks without the right guidance, training and mentorship. I learned about the more vast systems and how networking is the way and the future - everything shall be accessible from one backbone or terminal. Any network or interfaced system is convenient and keeps everything in the same realm while steering in one direction, rather than 4 or 5 different avenues trying to accomplish the same goal."
good,It is a good place to prove your capable and standard . sop and strict policy is followed here to work on princeple. Free on working procedure but on time and duty
good,"A typical day at work would be tea in the morning followed by review of ongoing projects, Electrical/Control system design, Electrical/Controls Drafting on Autocad, Consultation with peers on current projects, Lunch, Review of current projects with Electrical Manager, More drafting/Design, Afternoon Tea, Project save/backup, home."
good,"I love the job, environment was not desirable.  Theft by superiors, lack of safety enforcement as approved by OSHA standards.  Excellent benefits."
good,"Ela é uma empresa boa de trabalhar mais está passando por momentos de cortes de redução de custos atualmente não estou mais lá pois mandaram 32 funcionários de uma vez só!Mais era bom de trabalhar lá os funcionários e as gerencias também,tinha a parte boa e parte ruim como toda empresa."
good,Did not learn anything new here. Most of the co workers where great to work with apart from one who would make work life difficult at times. The management was great. The hardest part of the job was the atmostshere due to the co worker. The most enjoyable part of the job was variety of the work
good,"Johnsons Controls is een goed, professioneel bedrijf waar je begeleid wordt, mogelijkheden hebt jezelf te ontwikkelen, open deur polici, alles bespreekbaar en eigen inbreng was er mogelijk."
good,This job is really easy and as long as you go with their attendance you will be hired in with in a year. But they are not sensitive to having children or give you enough heads up for over time The notice could be as little as two hours before your shift ends or as late as when your shift begins.
good,"Very well Pay. They start you off at 10. Then you work your way up there. Management is very good. I had the best times with my co-workers. The only two problems I have is that the work can get out of control at times but hey its a job, and the schedule changes. When the schedule is not good it takes a lot of time for them to change it for you, but then again at least they change it."
good,Hardest part of the job was standing for 10 hours a day. Good management willing to help you out and answer any questions.
good,"Rotación por varios puestos,horas extras,trabajo muy físico pero estaba bien. Aprendí a hacer trazabilidades,a tener paciencia con las maquinas.Me gusto estar en varias zonas y ser polivalente."
good,Work at JCI for 19yrs. Great people and great environment to work.

good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,A good place to work. Clean and respectable. We work a lot of overtime year round. The Company often hires Staff Members from within the Plant.
good,"General admin, facility management, vendor management, cafeteria management, security"
good,"Alight Job friendly environment nice people to work with.  "
good,Working from home through a home office and at client sites.  Management and team I worked with was great.  We were more like a family than a team.  The hardest part of the job was convincing clients that what we were doing was to help make their company better. Being my own manager and managing my territory with little micro management was the best part of this position.  Communication was not great from the upper level management.  My direct supervisor was great but upper management was cold and heartless.
good,"Nos dias normalmente é sem surpresa, aprendi praticamente tudo o que sei sobre logística na Johnson."
good,Some managers were excellent and others left a lot to be desired.  Overall it was a reasonable place to work.
good,Worked well on any assigned task. Completed and exceeded the required production rates. Would definitely enjoy working for the company again.
good,Good experience and I did learn about continuous improvement techniques
good,Hit the ground running every morning. Chance to learn at lot from people who were very knowledgable in their field of expertise.
good,"Not a bad place to work, everyone is friendly and relaxed. Decent day to day job either in the office or in the field. The progression is really slow however and the amount of support from HR and the corporate side of the business. If you don't mind not progressing anywhere and not really having much support within the job then this is an okay place to work. Basically if you don't mind coasting by and working pay check to pay check this is okay."
good,It's would be a great place to work if they stop having favorite out there and learn to work together. The management is not good if they could get people in there that know what they are doing it would be a great to work.
good,"I love my job, but I don't appreciate being bounced back and forth from one dept to another. Especiallly when I get bullied from one member of the other dept. I wouldn't mind staying in my dept. ( Hoses)."
good,"Decent place to work, management was good, culture was typical manufacturing environment. Hardest part of the job was seeing others treated differently because HR was afraid to do anything to them."
good,"Review Aging daily worked with project managers, worked payment plans for certain projects. Weekly reconciliation of accounts, worked with Branch Manager."
good,"its fast past job, johnson contorl hours are 8 a day and if your lucky up to 7 days of work meaning good pay checks . time and half on saterdays double of sundays. only thing that sucks is you have to be a perminet employee to get the benifits ."
good,i love them it was long hours of hard work and time. i liked all the people i worked for in that place even though it was a short time there. loved it
good,"Typical day at work was demanding. Learnt patiences and how to work with different teams. Management style for my team was excellent, when they were needed they were available. Culture is friendly."

good,"Company changed significantly after transformation into multi-industrial.  Great place to work day to day and acts as a truly global company.  Traditional, conservative culture."
good,"This is a great company to work at! I worked here for the age of 18 till I was 20 and they decided to lay me off, your surrounded by fun people who always have a laugh and get the job done, you always have a target to hit! And near enough every day I got 100% as a temp but the permanent workers would never hit 100% so I don't know why they would lay a good hands on worker off but keep people who fail to achieve there goals that have been set."
good,"aprender a montar os bancos"
good,"Johnson Controls"
good,tinha muitas oportunidade para subir de cargo na empresa com cursos que eles mesmo proporcionavam para seu empregados.
good,"todas as manhãs, fazíamos a troca de equipamentos de segurança para o turno da manhã, depois reabastecia o estoque e fazia as planilhas de controle, aprendi a mexer com planilhas e leis da segurança do trabalho, os colegas de trabalho muito agradáveis, sempre se ajudava, A parte mais difícil era mexer com as planilhas com atenção e sem erros, a mais agradável era fazer a inspeção nas linhas de produção."
good,It was a very pleasurable experience being there. Very friendly co workers and awesome bosses.
good,I worked for a few hours during the day since the students would write the exams late during the day. I learned how to assist people. The management was good since I only worked with the Principal and one teacher. The difficulty was when the number of papers did not balance with the registration of students attending the exam.
good,"BMS, Fire Alarm, CCTV, Intrusion, PA, PLC"
good,a day at workis good. i learn as much as i can. good with people there is no hard part of my job the most enjoyable is learning new ways to enprove my job
good,"como foi a minha primeira experiência de trabalho aprendi muita coisa, como se comportar dentro da empresa, como se dar com as pessoas de trabalho..."
good,"Control y manejo de personal, asi como la toma de desiciones."
good,Johnson control is good place to work from 5:00 to 4:30. it's not hard to do but it is a job you get paid weekly. Lunch hours decent. Management is ok.

Agora n hospital foi a maior experiencia da minha vida colaborar cm pessoa pessoas q precisa d voce e ter como ajudar e muito bom,trabalhei como coopera adorava servir as pessoas. Depois fui pra cozinhar ser cozinheira eu colocava todo meu amor na comida. Dava o meu melhor e consegui"
good,Good company with good corporate standards incorporated in all segments of the everyday work. The working cultire is good and there are good possibilities for development.
good,"JCI was an extremely rewarding company to work for and they took great care of their employees! They have spectacular insurance and benefits as well as pay and advancement opportunities!"
good,"Great money. Good bosses. Solid coworkers. But the schedule will kill you. I worked at the Holland, Ohio battery plant. The money ws fantastic.  In fact the plant  challenge is to try to NOT make $100,000. The bosses genuinely cared about their guys. The schedule is what got me. You work  19 days on then 2 off. Within your 19 on, you'll be working about 10-15  12 hour shifts and that could be 4 hours early or 4 over. It will wear on you fast. If you can handle the schedule, you can make some serious money"
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,included in my CV / creating invoices based on PO received from Italy
good,"The work at JCI was very...unique how ever that doesn't mean that ALL the workers at JCI are bad people, just not morning people. While my supervisor was neat and kind my trainer on the other hand was very rude and mean."
good,it was a great place to work. sometimes it would be 95 to 111 degrees. But we worked as a team and got the job done. The hardest part about the job is the temperature.
good,Nagyon sok jó dolog miatt is javasolom mindenkinek
good,"great company, great co-workers, great benefits, great pay, respectful co-workers and manager, shift time, friendly environment"
good,"I worked as accountant clerk on scanning department. I received invoices from suppliers of building effeciency and I was checking if the purchase order number and address is correct. If they were correct I sent them to processing department. If they were wrong I sent them back to suppliers with reason. Each worker had responsibility for their countries from which they received invoices. My countries was Turkey and South Africa. I learned to communicate with people from different positions, departments and countries for faster process of invoices, responsibility for my work to be done better, processes in company from receiving invoices to payment and many rules and habits."
good,"every one is good, salary is good but the work is very much fast..."
good,People are great hours are reasonable it's safe the work is not hard to you then minutes breaks  half hour lunch people are helpful will be trained   there are two shifts
good,nice enviroment tight nit crew
good,was very different to work with others who only cared about the breaks and lunch period.
good,Management needs to be revamped!!! The culture there sucks and it pulls the moral down. This is a great company to work for but need the right people in Management positions to make decisions.
good,It would be a great place to work only if some of the white people wasn’t so racist and crazy. But most of the people are okay and the work is easy it’s just so hot that it’s hard for you to breath. Sometimes I have to stop and go get some water because it feels like I’m about to pass out.
good,the work was very fast going 80 hour work weeks pay was great one bad down fall was 7 day work weeks. shifts were disorganized and little leadership was shown.
good,Good company overall..  Enjoyed my time there..  I had my best sales year ever and still got laid off.  No security.. Just a cog in the machine..  Typical workday starts early and lots of emails and phone calls..  Poor management .. 5 different managers in 5 yrs..  No stability which customers notice..  Bad reputation with many customers but also good as well..  Just poor local managers..
good,Ok place to work just need to reduce overtime and mange orders better. Work hours are crazy most of the time you work 60 plus hrs a week no time to be at home with family and relax no time to enjoy life
good,"ok boring inspected car batteries. 12 hour days. very political, extreme lack of communication, lack of care except for what they were obligated to show."
good,"Once clocked in I would go to my press and wait for the tech to come start it. I would inspect and put away parts and assemble the ones as needed. The management was pretty good, very serious about the job and the importance of having quality parts. Co-workers were easy to get along with, always willing to help if needed. Hardest part of the job was at times working a two man press with just one person. I enjoyed interacting with people and seeing the finished product."
good,just have real bad management but other the that you learn a lot about team work and leadership... its fun things to learn and you have fun while learning..
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"management doesn't tell you anything til the last minute, people on production floor have more common sense and can think stuff through more than people in office"
good,"Práce byla fajn, finanční ohodnocení uspokojivé, soutěživost   a neférovost kolegů, zaměstnanců a vedení vysoká"
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work, but there wasn't any advancement in the section I worked.  Our manager wouldn't help us get raises.  There was no set progression or career ladder to advance to different steps in our job."
good,"el trabajo es tranquilo."
good,"Cadre de travail plutôt agréable parfois froid, par contre l'encadrement est très bien et personnel agréable"
good,"Nesta obra que eu trabalhei a empresa estava muito atrasada com os seus serviços, devido a liberação da fiscalização. Fica difícil avaliar por conto disto a gerência ficou perdida, tornando o relacionamento dos funcionários difícil devido o atraso da obra."
good,The best part of my job was that I was able to take old beat-up machines and turn them into automated machines. Everyone was always wondering what machine I would get a hold of next.
good,"What fire was burning the brightest , is where i was sent . Started on the system side of things . But quickly adapted to be one of very few to be able to cross over between all three divisions and there in between ."
good,"Hay mucho tiempo extra, el sistema de inventarios es algo confuso"
good,"Empresa de médio porte com uma estrutura de trabalho muito bem organizada e planejada com trabalho padronizado em com just time, exige muita comprometimento e desenvolvimento profissional dos colaboradores."
good,"I workes here immediately following my senior year of high school. While working there, the pay was good and the majority of the people were fairly friendly. I was not a fan of working the mandatory 7 days a week (although time and a half and double time were nice compensation) nor working in the only building without heating nor air, which astounded me to say the least. As stated earlier, the people were friendly but would constantly remind you to quit the job before you become a ""lifer"" (someone working for the company for an extended period of time) which could be very discouraging at times. The foreman of our department was incredibly rude and disrespectful to pretty much everyone in our department and, at times, would spew hate speech at individuals thaf weren't on his good side."
good,"I enjoyed the job and area that I worked in but JCI as a whole is not mindful of family. I was told on numerous occasions that, ""this is your life."" "
good,good paying job if you like factory work. not the best place for new moms or being pregnant. good benefits. very inconsistent with overtime and management.
good,It a very fast paced working environment with lot of noise. The benefits are good but the boss at the time I was there wasn't friendly. Many people left the place because of him.
good,Johnson Controls was a fast pace job that built F250  trucks sits for Ford Truck plant. It was long hours and hard work but I enjoyed it. Every two Hours we would rotate to do another job until end of shift.
good,The only concern anyone had was how can i used this situation to make myself look better. Very easy to get let go if you don't mess well with the more senior workers.
good,"Proven implementation of problem solving methodologies (Greenbelt Six Sigma Certification - 2001), led the Lean6Sigma Program at York International, global supplier metrics, supplier quality improvements, inventory reductions and process improvements,"
good,"back in 2000 when I started, jci was a great place...busy, quality and productivity based attitude in management, and yet people oriented.  I tried to fix the 5 star rating as I clicked on only 2 stars for job security/advancement...should have clicked 4 stars, but could not fix it.  somewhere along the line, jci started a sell-out program as apparently they wanted to get out of the automotive seat industry, so they ""sold"" the plant to manufacturers industrial group (mig).  mig cut hourly pay in half, and the decline started...fulfilling contracts which were not renewed, lay-offs, etc.  the one thing that bothered employees was the secretiveness jci used.  nobody knew anything, therefore could not make plans with their lives."
good,"Hard but well done job with large common team built across plant and BU."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"the worst part of job was being on call 24/7."
good,"Doesn't handle work related problems very well.Policy of no phones with sick children, doesn't show employee satistfaction."
good,"Trabajo con sindicalizados, trabajo de equipo a niveles medios"
good,"A great company, good benefits and good salary. But unfortunately it there is not a carrer path."
good,technology has advanced more than the facility I work at. Management has considerably changed for the worse. Machinery is mainly old and outdated. wages are behind community leaders.
good,"Worked as a grade 9 technician. Got more experience on chiller operations and trouble shootings."
good,Nel complesso esperienza che a completato alcuni aspetti della mia professione
good,"Hard for me to say anything nice about the management. Johnson Controls has just taking over this Co, and I hope things will be a inprovement. Johnson Controls seems to be a very good Co and I wish them the best."
good,"I liked working at Johnson Controls, it was a very laid back position, very quite. I was usual able to get my work done early and then was able to clock out and go home."
good,Johnson Control just took over the company that I previously worked for.  Its still early in the merger so nothing to review at this point.  The company does show optimism going ahead toward the future.
good,Esta empresa ofrece a sus empleados un salario a mi parecer muy bueno sin embargo no ofrece muchas vacantes y no esta en constante mejora
good,"Working with and supporting the business units is great. Stronger Corporate leadership is required, "
good,"Would have been good job, but lack of training and time to get up to speed made it impossible to succeed. Company is too focused on serving the system and not concerned about helping colleagues, in my experience."
good,"On a typical day at Johnson control, i would clock in at 2:30 pm grab my data log sheet and begin a inspection process of door panels for kia automobiles, i would search for scratches, dents, water marks, and off coloration and turn in a daily data sheet to my supervisor of my findings inspecting over 500 door panels per day 5 to 6 days per week, i leaned to do rework and keep data and do daily averages, and use tools special to the quality control field, there the management was undergoing changes therefor making times confusing, my co workers were great people that did a great job of training and making me feel like a part of the team, the hardest part of this job was the low pay bringing only 8.00 per hour, the most enjoyable part was the learning experience"
good,"I am not a huge fan, this company not the best and has horrible benefits."
good,Large company that continues to see growth on a global level.
good,"Aprendí mucho sobre le manejo del personal, la responsabilidad y confianza que te brinda tu superior la relación con los operadores buen buena solo que mi compañera era un poco envidiosa pero de ahí en fuera todo excelente la verdad muy buenas amistades conseguí en ese trabajo."
good,"Johnson Controls is overall an excellent company to work.  They provide resources for higher education, community services, and employee wellness.  The company is however experiencing a lot of change over and layoffs offering little job security and a feeling of insecurity for it's employees.  Due to downsizing, there is little chance for advancement in the near future."
good,"Culture is One Team but they tend to be more siloed than the original impression as a result of the heavy pressure to produce with less resources, short-sighted mgmt and poor technology"
good,"Great people, great work environment, company struggles to show profit since spinoff from Johnson Controls. I really enjoy the people, but it hurts to know there is little loyalty from employer to employee."
good,"Johnson Controls payed very well and has very experienced technicians. A lot of prevailing wage work. My time with the company was temporary but in the short time I was there it was obvious that they where going through growing pains with its recent merger with simplex, Communication at times was extremely poor as a result.  The good out weighed the bad here though as the rate of pay was very good."
good,Johnson Controls had more money than common sense. There lack of leadership at the management positions was astonishing! The lack of detail in completing there projects overwhelmed me. They were without a project manager for over 18 months. Letting there sales staff run there projects without any supervision from upper management. Very scary environment to walk into and fix.
good,Presenting solutions for customers who needed life safety services for their business in order to keep them compliant.  helping them with documentations for their inspections.  Doing presentations in order to get new customers engages
good,"I'm not sue what to say, the culture is okay but there is no particular sense of team or loyalty. The regional management is viewed as a scary big brother that all should be fearful of. You show up, do what you're supposed to and get paid. They tend to fire quickly and go through management like crazy, even the good ones."
good,My specific branch seemed to have trouble getting business but other branches may have a better experience. This is just a buffer to appease the pushy web developers with their 150 character requirements.
good,High turnover in management. I was in maintenance and we had to work 6-7 days per week and 12 hour shifts. I worked there a LONG TIME and when I started it was fantastic until new management put more emphasis on the profit rather than the quality of work and treatment of employees
good,Usually you come in as a temp worker and get hired on to the company.  Working 5-6 days a week from anywhere from 5am-330pm lifting and staying on your feet.  Pray you have a supervisor that knows what he's doing.
good,"I was very pleased with my job at Johnson Control. Really good benefits, and vacation time. Got plenetly of over time and was able to manage my bills very well. Got a raise every 3 months."
good,The work culture at the Holland facility was fantastic.  This is in part due to the history.  Prince Manufacturing was bought by JCI.  The people were a great group to work with.  I grew a lot there.
good,Arbetet var helt OK men restiden från 05.00 på morgonen var arbetssam.
good,Direct supervisors are not concerned about employee needs.  This has risen to a level of indifference.  Employees are not motivated in ways that promote personal development.
good,"Apesar de ser uma Empresa muito boa para se trabalhar, ainda é uma Empresa com processos administrativos não tão maduros, resistente à mudanças e novas ideias e com sistema operacional (ERP) muito deficitário em termos de controles e relatórios, gerando muito trabalho e controle através de Excel que torna isso um risco à Companhia."
good,Johnson controls Pune is one of the good company. It deals with HVAC graphics. In terms of salary it pay very less.They don't have any particular criteria for company payroll.
good,ok place to work....did not feel part of the team....outsider because contracted without any reviews of performance... the supervisor was on a power trip
good,"It's an ok place to work but there is a lot lacking that needs to be drastically improved. However, I'd recommend it to anyone that is looking for a steady check"
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"it is a good company, good benefit, good manager specially in Saint Louis Branch( I dont know other place because i am working here in Saint louis).I love my direct manager, he is suck as best guy ever."
good,"I built them a small machine shop to repair equipment."
good,Company was great in providing educational funds their employees but never provided a mentor program for their workers in order to gather experience in our field of study after graduation.
good,Sitzfertigung bereich Ford und bis 2014 Opel. Zusammenbau der Sitze an der Linie
good,"The work wasn't too hard on you depending on the job, the people were great , pay and benefits were good and you got to do a different job every hour. I learned far too many things to list while working here. Management was that.. but all good people. There weren't really hard parts to the job. I liked the job but it does't have a future."
good,"Felt I was always being monitored to get the most work out of me."
good,"Always stayed busy, worked with a great group of girls in the office.  Enjoyed working with all of my technicians.  I enjoyed the fact that I could telecommute if necessary."
good,"uma empresa com bom benefícios, mas a liderança não ouve o funcionário, e  disciplina rigida"
good,variety of jobs to choose from and many skill sets required to complete the job. coworkers are great and fun to be around.
good,Good company to work for but it's hard to balance your work with a life outside.  Biggest plus was my location had a great group of people to work with.
good,there was no communacation between supervisors between the shifts. so there was alot of standing around. machines always breaking down.
good,"A day working for JCI could be both enjoyable and frustrating. While there was a lot of equipment to learn about and work on at our site, my coworkers kept me out of the loop. What I did learn, I read from manuals and received information from sub-contractors working on the equipment. What I did learn was how to monitor for proper readings, basic maintenance and repair, some HVAC operation and repair, how to monitor, operate and make adjustments on the building automation system, small motor repair/replacement, and assorted preventive maintenance. Management wasn't very helpful with getting me training and work experience, but they kept me busy nonetheless. The hardest part of my job was the struggles I had with getting work experience, training, and open lines of communication with the JCI team. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I did get an opportunity to learn something new about the site equipment. Another enjoyable aspect was interacting with the building tenants and other sub-contractors. I had a great working relationship with both groups and enjoyed assisting and working with them. Overall, despite the tribulations I was up against during my employment with JCI, I did manage to make the most of my time there. What I did learn, I fully intend to follow up with either training classes on my own time or to incorporate it into my next position."
good,"Empresa em crescimento, com forte enfoque em vendas, com necessidades expressivas na parte operacional"
good,good company also same salary is not good the managemanet is friendly but i want a high salary to give all of expensive
good,buildseats for chrysler by putting headrest on seat handle and other parts at a timely fasion i train other co-workers to do the same thang ive learned other positions at the job line it was a great exprience for me because i no what to expect in the car company business
good,Working with zoo keepers to assure the safety & welfare of all animals.
good,Waynesboro facility is moving most of it's fabrication and machining to Mexico which is creating a very hostile work environment.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,Building seats for car companies at a fast place. Used many Power tools and a lot of team work. Hardest part of the job is working with someone that cant keep up so one would have to sometimes do two jobs to keep a the pace going. Oh and stay cooling the summer times.
good,"A typical day was stressing because the management was always disrespecting us because they had authority and abused it. Thw co-workers were nice, and the hardest part was making the leather seats. The easiest part was loading them on the assembly line"
good,worked with some good group of people.work was fun and enjoyable helping a wide range of people.
good,Johnson controls had a great team atmosphere. It continually strove to be a leader in the world market place and was very competitve. A great place to work. The branch I was in was very supportive of its team members and helping each other out in a jam. The overall experience was positive. They spared no expense in my training and continued training through out my time there.
good,"Low pay starting out but raises are every year regardless of job performance.  Medical, dental, 401k and vacation.  Usually there is a lot of overtime."
good,"Empresa en constante cambio, se tienen muchos sistemas pero no se usan de la forma adecuada para mejorar los resultados"
good,10 days are the norm.  Did not like all the changes in upper management or how the company was changing directions.  They created a lot of confusion and stress by setting very unrealistic goals.
good,Cultivated ways of reducing costs and streamlining manufacturing.  New product implementation and new equipment validation.  Sustained multiple assembly lines while introducing product improvement.
good,JCI was good company to work for within reason. They were facility management in a district heating and cooling facility. Worked with them without any issues.
good,Great global company that provides excellent wages and good benefit package. Job stability can be iffy due to an unstable automobile industry. Management can get unstable also
good,"The title really says it all. If you are willing to be cut-throat you will suceed greatly here. Otherwise, there will be lots of obsticles in your way to sucess. Some of the employees are wonderful and driven but the people that have power arent often in tune enough to make the necessary culture and staffing changes."
good,Johnson Controls built upon my skills in being a sequenced parts delivery customer of a major OEM.  We had clear cut expectations and were a numbers driven facility in ensuring we supplied our customer with the quality parts they needed when they needed them.
good,"Stressful work, as is any company running24/7 that you have to fix on the fly. Lack of correct parts to fix correctly and inability to shut down line to make proper, and more permanent repairs"
good,"Being  a legacy Tyco employee, I can not accurately review ""Johnson Controls"". Our facility  is currently transitioning and each day there are new discoveries. Overall my tenor with the company has been well spent. I have learned a great deal about the supply chain industry. Management at the local level is where there is the greatest opportunity."
good,The area where I worked at was called fabrication. I had to put different fabric on metal like fabric glass to cotton foil. I work around people that didn't mind helping you learn everything you needed to know in that area....The hardest part was getting the people to bring your work on time..so you want get behind
good,"It was really awesome experience through out my journey with Al Salem Johnson Controls, I was able to learn a lot  from my superiors, colleagues. i really enjoyed the work atmosphere, mostly i am so thankful to my superiors who share a lot of financial knowledge and well support in my career life."
good,A typical day at work is is challenging with solving problems that arise.  Upper management and structure change very frequently and it affects the direction of the day to day operations and the goals of the teams.  The most enjoyable part of working for JCI is the people who work there.  Everyone is very friendly and there are a lot of long term employees.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"Very fast passed, keeps up with trends and updates in technology. "
good,"Must be able to work anywhere in teh country.  - Pleasant place to work with good salary,  pension and benefits. Good advancement prospects and good management. Good on the job training."
good,the hours were good it was a fast pace environment very heavy lifting but everyone helped eachother . I really liked working their but the pay was very little for me in my situation. the site supervisor was very understanding with our needs n breaks were good n lunch time as well. nothing bad to say about the company.
good,"es una empresa que genera mucho aprendizaje, sus jornadas son pesadas pero productivas."
good,I worked there for a long time and I advanced in many different areas and shipping and receiving I was a materials coordinator over to plants overall forklift operations and trainer for forklifts immediate supervisor was let go and there was about 60 heads laid off when they sold out. Unfortunately I was let go in that happened. I never intended on leaving I had planned on retiring from that company.
good,"Managers kept changing nervier really knew who was in charge. Check  inventory, find out where production sequence was at and what trucks were loaded. Call in's, managing work force. I had class on Six sigma black belt, lean mfg. Enjoying meeting team members and finding out about who they are and telling them about me."
good,"Positive place to work"
good,"Loved the employees there, but our last Maintenance Manager was less than effective! Held grudges, played favorites, acted like a 10 year old on the school field.... Had to leave!"
good,As a maintenance tech. I should have never been told to give a machine not working at 100% back to production. Quality should come before quantity....
good,"Lots of good training and experience."
good,"the hardest part of the job was standing around when the machines broke down.  the machines are old and need to be replaced. it was also very hot in the summer no air or fans,   very cold in the winter no heat at all except in the bathrooms.   even wearing multi layers it was very cold.   and hard to work with multiple layer."
good,the job is busy and you are never left with nothing to do but the agency you are employed with can drop you at a shifts notice and there is no certainty of any work.
good,There is lots of over-time available if you want it. 12 hours a day and 6 days a week. There really is no hard part of this job. The most enjoyable part was that it wa easy to learn all the machines.
good,I enjoyed working for this company 17 years. I grew Professionally and learned a great deal. This company gave knowledge and many opportunities to travel.
good,When I first started at this company the was a culture of encouraging employees to improve themselves. This continued until the headlining business dissolved.
good,"Great place to work if you enjoy 7 days a week every week. Compensation good, benefits good. Plant management uses management by fear. Real good vacation package for salaried staff."
good,"A typical day was operating a machine that produced 2 liter soda bottles for various soda manufactures. "
good,"This was overall a good job, it was manufacturing f-150 truck seats. The work itself was easy, the hours were great, the people who worked there were great. The only problem was, every few years it was time to make a bid with Ford to build their seats. There was always a danger that Johnson Controls would be under bid, and you could either get a pay cut, or be layed off."
good,"JCI offers a wide range of opportunities for it's engineers.  The balance between product development and manufacturing issues is sometimes blurred, with manufacturing and operations generally being the priority."
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"Llegar repartir lista de urgentes (trato con los supervisores), ver la programacion y limpiar, programar le dia de la semana correspondiente, codificar acomulados, locanizar balanceos, realizar AETC y pull."
good,"В момент выхода на рынок автопрома в России компания была нацелена оперативно решать интересные производственные задачи, развивать бизнес творчески."
good,"I love everything about my job expect for the 6 and 7 days a week and the 12 hour days and no end in sight. "
good,"El ambiente laboral en la empresa es muy bueno, es agradable que se tomen en cuenta tus opiniones para la solución de problemas, de igual manera existen algunos contras, tales como la falta de comunicación y las tareas ""repentinas""."
good,Qua werk en collega's heb ik het naar mijn zin gehad bij Johnson Controls. Genoeg afwisseling qua werk. Zat nooit de hele dag op mijn werkplek. En het was ook afwisselend werk. Geen één dag was hetzelfde. De relatie tussen het management en het personeel kan beter.
good,"I do not have issues with JCI as a whole. Its a good successful very profitable company with good benefits and a good track record. The reasons I am looking for a job have to do with the company making moves to become profitable. About a year ago they decided to break off our service team into a seperate division called GWS. About a month ago they announced publicly that they are going to divest our part of the company. That means 1800 employees are going to be sold to an undisclosed company, at least as many as the buyer wants to keep. I run a specialized program called furniture recovery and it is a rare bird in the industry. Meaning that it is unlikely another company will see the value in recycling furniture because of the cost to run the program. It is my belief that my part of the team will not make it through the sale. I have great references within JCI, there is no personal issues with me as an employee, it just appears that my position will no longer make sense."
good,"Ein sehr kollegiales Umfeld mit stets neuen Umständen, die einen fordern."
good,"Empresa grande, multinacional, com alta infraestrutura em todas as áreas, o que permitia a execução das atividades de forma sempre bem estruturada, precisa e bem feita. A parte mais difícil foi, como estagiário, ser responsável pela área de mecânica e responder pelos desvios de produção ou reclamações dos clientes diante algum desvio de produto. A parte mais agradável, foi o trabalho desafiador, o aprendizado, gerador de resultados, e o uso do idioma em reports constantes semanais."
good,"A use and discard management process. Started a new process to produce lead grids for batteries, set records for safety and production."
good,"a rotina de trabalho era bastante intensa ,metas difíceis de serem atingidas, aprendi muito como trabalhar em equipe como aceitar e conviver com as diferenças entre pessoas a parte mais difícil era retrabalhar os bancos e a mais agradável talvez fosse a ginastica laboral."
good,"the job was quite interesting. i learned the cutting of the dashboard, the molding, and placing the skin."
good,"Starting out, you learn a lot and quick, The more presses ypu know the better."

good,"As a mechanic you are union out of Local 198. Good benefits, decent pay."
good,"Fun work place, great management and co-workers, I have developed managing skills there."
good,"Very attentive to workers, appreciative to workers that woked their. Overall a good place to work."
good,"Johnson Controls does a lot for the communities their offices are in. They encourage volunteering and are always looking for ways to give back. Sometimes though, it would seem like the company is working a little too hard at making a name for themselves rather than focusing on their employees overall happiness and well-being. With this being such a large company, advancement can be rather difficult as you are competing with hundreds of internal applicants as well as hundreds of external. The management style in the department I work for varies greatly. We have 2 vertical market managers who differ in their management styles and that trickles down to the staff they manage. There is also a problem with treating everyone equally. What is good for one, is not always good for all. That being said, I have learned a great deal about company financials, contract management, billing and other skills by working for Johnson Controls. They have allowed me to push myself and learn different aspects of the buisness, and for that I am greatful. Right now, however, I am a square peg being forced into a round hole. My branch office reorganized and all of the positions that used to exist, were consolidated into 2 positions, which are both customer service. It is difficult to grow or learn when you are pigeon holed into a job that was not of your choosing."
good,*organization before work to do it better *safer work *was really good but for some time it is getting worse *is a group of people who help each other *not *if you do your work well
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"Begins with a morning meeting explaining the needs of the shift (what orders need to be done, how many need to be packed for the day) We then look at the parts and write a list of any parts needed for the shift. After giving the list to the team leader, we proceed to work. I have learned various jobs, anything from being a team leader, running a machine to wiring any furnace in there. My co-workers are all very nice, we work as a team to get our job done and everyone is willing to help each other to achieve this. The hardest part of the day is if we run out of parts or have defective material. The best part of the day is when we achieve our goal and meet the customer demands, it gives me a feeling of satisfaction of having done a good job."
good,"Al comenzar el dia laboral se revisa con el planner los productos con prioridad a elaborar, se realiza la requesicion de material y se ven los detalles si faltara alguno de ellos, de modo que se cumpla el psi diario respetando la programacion dada en el inicio de semana, dia a dia he aprendido atrabajar bajo presion y como mantener en equilibrio la linea a mi cargo, ademas entender cada una de las inquietudes de mis compañeros de trabajo llegando a una solucion aceptable para ambos, la gerencia busca que paso a paso que tengamos la confianza para acercarnos a ellos y expresrles nuestras ideas e innovaciones para un mejor desempeño del trabajo que realizamos, entre mis compañeros tenemos buena comunicacion, no existe parte dificil solo la actitud que toman algunos operadores el momento de acatar las decisiones que se toman para hacer cambios en la linea de produccion, lo mejor es la experiencia de saber como tratar a las personas para no crear un hambiente hostil en el trabajo, saberlos dirigir para que realicen su trabajo de manera responsable."
good,Great co workers and great place but long entrenched management and its survival instincts makes it difficult to change anything.
good,Expectations are very high and can be challenging to maintain an appropriate work/life balance.
good,"I love the focus on Green technology and advances in climate control systems for the environments in which we live and work."
good,Management could be difficult to work with at times but there was flexibility of work hours. The best part of the job was working independently but at a steady pace.
good,Keeping up with the training for programming alarm panel and radios. Working with field techs. Building shells for zone lists. Verifying that the correct signals reported in.
good,I enjoyed working with the people in the department I worked in. The project I was assigned to was interesting and team members were very helpful and engaged.
good,"A typical day at work was fast pace from 8am to 6pm. Day-to-day meetings with the direct client. Complex relation liaison with financial partners, senior management at JCI, and direct users."
good,"I consider that it is important a good team in order to success in the projects, and Leadership play a very important role in it."
good,Worked many years and had so many different managers.  You can move around into different areas of the business if you have support from leadership.  Great place to learn many skills.
good,"Good Experience, lots of opportunities.   international opportunity as a leader in the industry.  learned a lot about how to standardize business process."
good,Good company to work with also safety meetings before work starts. Started as a painting Assembly then moved to AC Unit Assembly line from there warehouse to unload trucks forklift
good,Worked in refinery down at the bottom with molding the hot lead into a square shape then when it went around in the carousel it started getting cool to form into a solid shape.
good,Excelente empresa. O aprendizado que foi me concebido foi muito importante para o meu conhecimento e para a minha formação profissional. Tive oportunidade de conhecer diversas áreas da empresa e interagir com elas.
good,This company makes excellent use of your skillset but there are limited opportunities for growth or transition into other roles. A good work ethic and technical skills are needed to succeed at this company
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,We had very good time while working  with JCI. typically we had some issue with my second project I was worked in JCI. even though  had good experience to wards learning.
good,"Etiquetage des batteries de toutes marques,"
good,I like the job what is easy fast paced nice environment overall a great place to work I would recommend to everybody pay was very nice I liked everything about it
good,"Great for a steady Job,40 Hour- 48 hour work week. Fast Paced, Gain Share and Pension Program, Lots of Cross Training options, Optional Overtime, Employee Appreciation Events"
good,"I enjoy the team spirit and emphasis on training that the company impacts on the employees."
good,The Company now known as Adient (formerly Johnson Controls) is not a bad place but you can expect at least a 12 hour work day 7 days a week. especially if your line goes down (which happens frequently) or your line falls behind on quota.
good,"It’s not bad can be stressful at times but what job isn’t, they are very lenient and generous with PTO and it’s pretty simple to work must have the right attitude to make it through the day. Overall it’s a good place for work, just not a career choice for me."
good,E empresa possui valores firmes e busca qualificar seus funcionários em prol à esses valores
good,You get what you put into it. You have the ability to move as high as you want with the company. As long as you take advantage of all the learning opportunities they provide to the employees.
good,Trabajo en equipo son las cosas de las cuales nos enseña está empresa
good,"I liked working at JCI initially because they had a gym, free classes, and medical offices on-site. They no longer provide these benefits to employees."
good,"Performed preventive maintenance daily, responded to emergency calls 24/7, collaborated with design engineers and contractors to oversee the clients desired project outcome."
good,"I work as a contingent in QA. I have been here over 11 months and not hired on yet. I have been given numerous excuses, reasons, and cop-outs as to why I have not been hired on. "

good,"El ambiente de trabajo regular, son muy accesibles"

good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."
good,"Corporate work environment, very safe and stable place to be. Internal career opportunities and personal development well organized. It is a very good example to studying project management and corporate structure."
good,This is a large company which I have held many roles.  Each job is completely different depending on who your manager is.  The location is a commuters dream.
good,Working at Johnson controls was a good team oriented job when being in the paint department. Didn't like the molding department felt they over worked one.
good,"Resolucion de problemas, buen aprendisage y un buen lugar para trabajar."
good,they would work you more than they would reward or seem to care for their employess. better management and for a company to actually show they care for their employees would go along way.
good,"I began working here in the summer of 1993.  My uncle got me the job.  It was only supposed to be a summer job, but I did so well that I got hired for regular shifts.  It was fast-paced and lots of competition.  There wasn't much team work. "
good,"JCI provides excellent talent enrichment, enhancement & in-depth product knowledge in one of the Forte's on Johnson controls."
good,Good company to work for. This was before TYCO merger and I was a contractor so YMV.  Did not work with the service side which is generally more popular.  I worked with Building Efficiency which is much smaller.
good,"great place to work ,terrible hours very fast pace work, keeps you running hours go by quickly, insurance not to good, pay is competiative to surrounding."
good,Good company to work with great people. Training is lacking so you have to learn on your own. Can have long hours and you can lose your job when the numbers are down.
good,They experience I had with this company was fairly good aside from the inherent difficulty in management to understand personal life.

good,"Part of being happy at JCI was due to the management i shared at the company who was always very supportive & open to discussions. Diversified in business as well as culture, JCI is very highly recommended."
good,"The company always states that safety is first but, based on the corporate emails they constantly send out, profit is equally important. Unfortunately,  this does not translate directly into a more productive and profitable work environment for employees. Regardless of how hard you work or how dedicated you are to the job, opportunities to advance are very few, and both that and the likelihood of being recognized for your accomplishments with any increase in salary is very low. They are old school in the sense that they start rewarding such opportunities after having spent 5 to 10 years at the company."
good,"Trabalhei por mais de dois anos na Johnson Controls e lá aprendi a área de automação predial. Tinha um ambiente de trabalho favorável, porém, sem muitas oportunidades de crescimento na empresa."

good,"There is no end to the amount of overtime available. Most of the time overtime is voluntary and many will sign up for it, but on special weeks the overtime is mandatory. If you like to work and want to make a lot of money with an honest day's work, come here. Last year instead of a standard 40 hour week (2080 hours/year) I worked over 3400 hours. I did it because I actually enjoy working here and Johnson Controls provides the opportunity to do so. I wasn't forced to work these hours, but allowed to."

good,"Excellent organization. Global, employs over 125K people world wide.   Excellent quality resources and corporate support."
good,"A typical day for me varies from one day to the next.  Because I'm the sole administrative person I'm responsible for a multitude of duties.  From doing light IT, reports (disclosure, expense, budget), to ordering supplies setting up meetings, light PAC responsibilities.  I feel that this company is a fairly good company.  However, the compensation is not commensurable with my areas."

good,"Because of the energy management and fire alarm departments, some days you go to work and get dirty (or itchy from insulation) and some days your uniform stays clean. The best part of the job is the different customers and other contractors that you get to know and work with.  I can't say much for the management that I've experienced knowing back then, but the management now, I believe, has much improved. The company provided vehicles for their technicians are much appreciated unlike cheapo companies that require their employees to use their own vehicle and even make them put a ladder on it!"
good,"I've worked at Adient  / Johnson Controls for a long time. I come in at 7:30 have meetings for 5-5 hrs per day, and usually go home around 5:30pm.  I've learned a lot over the years about everything in the Car interior , I was able to travel around the global and understand how other countries do business while working on Global programs.I have enjoyed working with the people and have made many life time friends."
good,"Work day are typical and sometime fast pace depending on what need to be accomplish. Learning the recycling business can be difficult, but very interesting the process to making battery. Management can be difficult but with the right team goals can be accomplish. Because of the work environment one of the hardest thing is maintaining blood lead level. All of the safety equipment is provide but it just hard for some to maintain at a good level. The enjoyable part  is when all safety goals are reach, production goals are met.

Now I am equipped to take on almost anything within the Maintenance field."

Managers vary quite a bit though.  The benefits and pay are good.  And typically there are plenty of options for growth within the company.  A word of caution though, the impending Tyco merger could see some large turnover in the near-mid term."

good,"I work for an Access Center that manages high security access systems for AT&T employees and contractors.  A typical day for me would start at 6am and I would start by reporting any AT&T central offices or buildings where the access system is offline.  Once those have been reported I start on any building system migrations/conversions/commissionings.  These include moving controllers from one server to another, bringing a controller online, and testing each card to make sure they are functioning properly. My job takes a great deal of multitasking and knowledge of over 10 systems.  I am constantly in and out of multiple systems at once and on the phone with technicians and supervisors.  This would be the hardest part about my job.  The most enjoyable would be always staying busy and getting to talk with different clients all over the US.  Learning each other's backgrounds and building a network of connections.  I have learned so much with this job and have been pushed to my limits and still managed to pull through and get the job done."

good,"Many of the organization's departments are centralized and there are very limited resources. This results in long lead times for services requested by customers. Further, the organization's procurement practices are borderline criminal as procurement often will refuse to pay its vendors. Many outstanding balances are 180 days past due before payments are made. This makes it difficult to conduct business and manage projects."

However, in recent years the talent pool in JCI has moved between the divisions as needed and as a result has made the company much stronger.  As the focus on Automotive diminishes and the multi-industrial framework dominates, partially through corporate shared services, many opportunities will be available to continue the growth trajectory established in past decades."

Management and the shift supervisors are very nice and every one usually conducts themselves maturely enough to stay out of trouble. The hardest part of my job is getting there because of the location. The most enjoyable part of the job is the optional overtime.
good,"A typical day included production and only having a rotation of about five jobs. Management, depending on the line and shift, were typically unorganized due to how they were always moved from line to line. Wasn't enough consistancy to ensure 100% effectiveness on regulations and quality. Hardest part of the job was offering my opinions on how to better the jobs I did and being ignored. The most enjoyable part of my job was the fast pace environment and usually being appreciated for how hard I worked."

good,"It is a MNC having good culture and having decent approaches."

good,"Great workplace with an awesome atmosphere that promotes learning and development while maintaining a safe environment and work ethic. "

They taught me all my true corporate work ethics and how to manage people accordingly. I truly enjoyed working there with all my co-workers. If you were salaried like myself and worked over time you accrued that time as paid or time off when you needed it. That was a excellent benefit for all management positions like myself. Even though I worked there less an a year I had more time off when I was on maternity leave that they allowed me to take on with pay,"
good,"The company is a good place to start your career and develop your skills. Immediate manager/supervisors are very friendly and easy to approach. "

We are in our 1st phase of operation on this P3 site and its fast moving and never a dull moment. The day ends around 5:30pm with a meeting of my managers that report to me.
good,Great place of employment. A typical day at work is pretty fast paced but you have all the tools to complete your job task.  I've gained great leadership skills during my years at Johnson Controls(BWI)..

good,If a person have been filling a position for more than 6 months then the company should make an offer to the individual most especially if they are performing their job duties successfully.  Keeping people on contract for over 18 month really sucks!!
good,I worked in one of the recycling centers and overall I am satisfied with my experience at JCI. I was able to become lean and six sigma certified. Our plant productivity was always lacking which made for a stressful environment at times. However the wages and benefits were fair and the overall culture of JCI was exceptional.
good,"I am responsible for four workers over a twelve hour period. At the beginning of a shift, I make sure that they have everything they need to do their job properly. I spend the remainder of the first two hours dinking (knocking out) the lead bushings of battery covers that have been scrapped. When the first two hours are over, I start break relieving for the four that I mentioned one at a time. And I repeat this cycle until the twelve hours is over. From this job I have learned how to effectively plan and use my time. Management at this company is somewhat supportive. I am praised for doing a good job and I am also receptive to constructive criticism when given. There is very little turnover on my shift so the workplace culture is close-knitted and familiar. The hardest part of my job is the fact that it is very fast-paced and physically taxing. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of doing my job well."

good,"Empresa comprometida con el desarrollo de los trabajadores, oportunidad de crecimiento a corto plazo."
good,"Apoyo al crecimiento personal y profesional "
good,As I progressed through the company I found I had more support. Internal recruitment could have been handled better as experience in the job was hardly considered and only an interview was necessary.
good,"I worked for Johnson Controls from January 2005 through October 2016.  A typical day at work is half meetings and half heads-down work.  I learned that you need to be 100% responsible for you and your schedule.  Make sure to take the time for yourself in terms of lunch, breaks, power-up and power-down time including time for the family where applicable.  My management from my observation reached their positions only based on functional accomplishment and not leadership ability.  That brought a cold efficiency.  The workplace culture was ""develop by doing.""  You have to learn as you go.  Thankfully, there are many opportunities to develop with web-based training and tuition reimbursement for obtaining academic degrees.  Best suggestion is to find and ask for mentorship and take charge with your own goals.  Understand that culture was the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and becoming friends with so many wonderful, warm and professional people who have contributed life-long benefit to me."

good,Great opportunity to work with many people from different cultures.  I really loved working with the regions to understand the business process.  My direct leaders were great.  Executive leadership needs work.
good,Fast pace job that will keep you focus making the time go fast! I learn about the parts that make up a heating pump unit and how to fix the product when comes to knowing what may be wrong with the wiring. The management is s fair but strict. The working culture is all about listening and working together on a assembly line. the hardest part is the keeping up with the fast paced job for hours. The most enjoyable part is being apart of the assembly line and watching automatic machines that do their own part.
good,JCI is fast paced. They need production and do what they can to meet their numbers. That means sometimes things fall to the wayside if they are not a priority. Any complaints I could come up with for this company are already to be expected working in manufacturing.

The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you have helped people to stay safe.

I led engineering design teams located in Milwaukee and in India in the development of new Refrigeration products.

I live 40 minutes away otherwise I would probably stay."

good,"The Watertown facility was a great place to work. Unfortunately the business took a downturn resulting in reduced employment.  The facility was sold and is now closed,"
good,I enjoyed my time working here and would gladly do it again. The hardest part of the job was the heat.  The most enjoyable was the great compensation!
good,"Productive and fun at times,liked being in my own space away from others. The work was not hard at all,we were incinitive based so team work had to be involved.I enjoyed most about the job was learning my job and becoming one of the best at it,I was the go to person too train new comers.Managing a company is challenging for every plant manager it takes a lot of knowledge and commucation skills."

good,"One of the best jobs I've had! Great people to work with, approachable managers, team environment. I was a contractor so I do not know about the perks and benefits."
good,"Invoicing Dept was a little difficult to work in. Training consist of 4 different ""teachers"" all teaching ""their way"" so it makes if difficult to fully get an understanding of what is the correct way to do things. Then when sent to the floor your on your own. Unless you have worked in invoicing before it could be a set up for failure."
good,"Every day was a different and interesting experience. Some days would be a service/preventive maintenance visit. others, repair, retrofit or installation of field controllers and their associated software."
good,Tyco/Johnson Controls  has been a very good place for me to work. I've gain new knowledge and worked with Elite tech. It is a fun atmosphere to be a part of.
good,"Going in and having friendly faces great you no matter what time you go into work. And everyday is something new to learn. Management challenges you everyday with something new,different incentives and overtime. As well as the people that i work with. Doing our jobs and sharing our day to day lives is what makes it more then just a job. It's like a another home. So it's  not like work at all."

good,"Ótima empresa de se trabalhar, com bons benefícios para o funcionário."
good,"Union job. Set guidelines for duties. Not allowed to go beyond the scope of job. Was interesting facility, however pay grade was not consistent throughout plant. Some employees earned incentive pay, while others earned straight pay. This caused strain on employee dynamic throughout employment as duties were similar in function but paygrade was nearly double. Air quality was always a concern since they crafted car batteries which used lead. Many jobs required respirators to be worn throughout entirety of shift. Uniforms were provided to protect transfer of lead contaminates to civilian clothing. Showers were required at end of shift using specialized soap."
good,Great place to work. Great pay and benefits. It was close to home. We could just go in and find out what was needed to get done and it got done. Really disappointed they decided to close the facility during the economic down turn in 2009.

I got faster each day and I loved what I was doing as far as being part of a team that helped build trucks and jeeps. I worked with wonderful people that became family. The hardest part of my job was not having a set time to get off because I was unable to plan any appointments. The most enjoyable part of the day was clock out time.

good,I was responsible for building seats for Kia Moters I was schedule to work 8 hrs shifts mon thru Fri over time was available. Johnson Controls was a learning experience for me. Most of my work history is in fast food so I had to learn everything from using power tools to learning how to work on a assembly line. The management team there was awesome. The hardest part was leaving.
good,"Great benefits, hands on training, very competitive pay rates and the people are just great! The corporate culture is relaxed while there is a major feeling of being a part of a team.

good,"The company is not perfect but in total it's a great company to work with and you were able to meet new good friends. There are challenges  especially the volume of work that you need to accomplish as well as fun day with other staff. It attracts job seekers to join in the organization because of the name and working environment it already established. Practically, some of the systems need to be upgraded to meet with the market standards but the best thing is to be acknowledge by your hard work."

good,"Johnson controls is a Good company to work for. Great benefits , Decent salary , many opportunities to advance. Only down fall is management is slow with everything."
good,"I enjoyed working for JCI and wanted to say on with the company very much so. But, unfortunately I was hired through a staffing agency called Experis and after my required 6months with the staffing agency ""which was more of a pain than anything” was let go due to the lack of work being provided due to low sales by their sales department in finding more contractual projects. They provided very good benefits, although I will say the company was very much lacking on their training programs and unbeknownst to me was a rather competitive work environment as a systems tech working with their LSS techs, sort of a poor structure for relayed information needed in the completion of certain projects and or roadblocks between its own contractors and completion time for projects. Though despite aforementioned, the 3 LSS techs in charge were striving in their projects for completion despite the rudimentary venues they strife to adept thereof in there attempts for completion of their projects thanks to one lead LSS and his senior supervisor. But overall, I believe direct hire would have benefited all parties more so, though that might just be my opinion. But as far as the required training for the position and how fast the company has newer and better breakthroughs with technology it was very poor to follow and learn quick enuf for some in order to stay on top of progress and completion of projects weather repair, upgrades, or new construction where in keeping with completion deadlines. Overall, working with JC was very fun and always kept you on yr toes, a very hurry up and weight sort of"
good,"Johnson Controls is a well run machine.  It's physical security division is going through a mesomorphs since it's merger with Tyco and Simplex.  The biggest disappointment was selling projects and not having the jobs installed in some instances for over a year.  Since I was paid on completed jobs, that did impact my paycheck."

good,"They are working 8 hours on daily basis 5 days a week ."
good,a typical day at work started by promptly showing up to the line by 5:30 pm on the dot. we would hear info on the product we would be running then begin our daily stretches. i learned how to use power tools safely quickly and accurately. the management was not very engaged with employees and had little understanding of issues that could be very detrimental to production. they also preached good safety practice but never implemented process for it to be practiced other than daily stretches.my co-workers turned into to more like family we were a team and we understood we need each other day in and day out so we work together with no issues among ourselves. the hardest part of the day would be figuring out exactly what our quota for the day was because management communication was very poor. the best part of the day would be the engagement of my peers. they made work a gateway/get away in my home life.
good,"Excellent learning opportunity for anyone considering a career in HVAC sales. Management was supportive, and the learning environment was open and welcome."

good,"Primarily, our job at Johnson Controls was to ensure the safety of our clients. To do so, everyone started off their shift being up to 20 minutes early, to enforce punctuality and to be prepared for the next however-so-many hours they had to work. This included logging into the required software, situating their phones lines and so forth. Although the work place was very comfortable, and the staff/management were more than willing to help whenever, I believe the hardest part about this job was making a call to a client who was in a life risking situation, and blamed out security system for their problem. Customer service was also something we took pride in, so when a client had a particular problem with our company, it was our first priority to fix the matter. One thing I miss about the job was the other EDO's. With Johnson Controls environment, it was extremely easy to make friends and workplace relationships."

Conducted scheduled monthly fire panel test. Assisted the Risk Management group with scheduled severe weather alert and fire drills using the fire panel alarms. "
good,"Johnson Controls has high expectations for performance so work/life balance can be difficult to maintain.  The environment is very collaborative and professional with many career advancement opportunties.  Pay and benefits are very competitive for the automotive industry.  Recent direction makes it unclear if the BoD is still committed to the automotive industry, so there is probably a high probability of divestment if involved in the automotive division.  Overall a great place to work."

When I worked there I really did enjoy the job, but co-workers were sometimes complicated to work with due to the set up of the way daily operations worked. I can't speak for now, because it has been so long. Management was really good with taking care of situation and we also had a union.

The jobs are not physically demanding, or hard to learn, problem is swing shift (2 weeks days, 2 weeks afternoons) is hard on the body and can lead to burnout. Being a union environment advancement is all seniority based, not skill based. Rumours in the auto industry about future is also the worst I have ever faced, constant rumours of job being over, not helped when contract time comes around and management does nothing to dispel them."

good,"Excelente empresa de clase mundial, gran oportunidad para desarrollo comprometido con la capacitación"
good,They pay well but environment is very rough. It is a hazardous place to work. Certain precautions have to be made because the lead is in the air. You can be as safe as possible but it is still getting in your system.

good,"I must start with a huge appreciate of JCI for giving me the opportunity to learn and grown in the industry however over the years the work life balance became non existent with optimizing of key staff.  Taking away key support staff and giving to management to team to take care.

good,"Great environment to work. Sequencing of instrumental panel was a challenging  process to match with General Motors line production of vehicles. Working in a strong union atmosphere makes you aware of how seniority manipulates the system if the rules are not followed closely. The hardest part of the job is when sequencing goes awry and the numbers don't match, maneuvering is required to get the system back into place.Everyday was  a challenge,so you have to be mentally prepared."

good,"I have been a sales rep for JCI for about a year and a half now and I love it. The work life balance is great. The company perks and benefits are great. There is tons of room to grow and develop. Endless learning materials available. I really enjoy the laid back, but professional and driven atmosphere in our office. I am not sure what it's like in every other district, but most of those I have  met from other districts seem to love their job too. It's a sales job, so there will always be those who don't last long if they aren't cut out for it, but many of our sales reps have been with the company for 10+ years. Once you get in a establish yourself you can make great money. Like any sales job, it's a roller coaster. JCI is a huge corporation and there is always a big push for more and more sales. You have to make your stock holders happy, but you're going to have that anywhere. If you are hitting your sales numbers you are left alone. Want to work from 11am to 2pm? No one cares as long as you are hitting your numbers, answering emails (company phone provided), taking care of issues that pop up throughout the day. Having the ability to work from home and set my schedule everyday is awesome. My only real complaint is that company is SO big that there is a lot of corporate red tape. There are many hard to work with redundant programs you have to use and it can take a long time to get answers back and problems solved when there are issues you can't solve immediately. That just comes with being a large business. All in all I love what I do and hope to stay and grow with JCI long term."
